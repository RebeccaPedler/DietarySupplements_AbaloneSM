Two isolates (Lactobacillus sp. strain a3 and Enterococcus sp. strain s6) were highly resistant to bile salt and/or gastric juice and inhibited the growth of three abalone pathogens (Listonella anguillarum, Vibrio harveyi, and V. carchariae). Each of the LAB isolates was used to supplement diet of the abalone Haliotis gigantea for a period of 3 weeks. One group of animals received Lactobacillus sp. strain a3 added to commercial dry feed, one group received Enterococcus sp. strain s6 added to the feed, and a control group received only standard commercial feed. Culturable LAB counts of gut homogenates indicate the a3 colonized in the gut of abalones. Digestive enzyme activities and the concentrations of a number of volatile short-chain fatty acids (VSCFA) were elevated in the gut of abalones receiving feed supplemented with the two LAB strains. These results indicate that dietary supplementation can enable LAB colonization or persistence in the gut of abalone species and can potentially enhance probiotic effects. © The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science 2009.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Malgorzata""=>""Included"", ""Rebecca""=>""Included"", ""James""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome",10.1007/s12562-009-0138-5,"",,

Purified diets supplemented with 0, 40, 800 mg PN kg-1 or 80 mg kg-1 of 4-deoxypyridoxine (PN antagonist) were fed to adult abalone (initial weight 45.77±0.25 g; initial shell length 68.02±0.78 mm) for 90 days. The air-dried brown kelp, Laminaria japonica, was used as a control diet. Each diet was fed to three replicate groups of abalone in a recirculation system using a completely randomised design. The results showed that weight gain ratio (WGR) of the abalone generally increased with the level of dietary PN supplementation though no significant differences were found among the treatments (P>0.05). Phagocytic and phenoloxidase activities were significantly higher in abalone fed diets supplemented with 800 mg PN kg -1 than those fed the PN-free diet or the one with 4-deoxypyridoxine (P<0.05). Agglutination titre and respiratory burst activity were significantly higher in abalone fed diets supplemented with 40 mg PN kg -1 than those fed the PN-free diet or the one with 4-deoxypyridoxine (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in immunological characteristics between the abalone fed the diet containing 40 mg PN kg -1 and those fed the diet containing 800 mg PN kg-1 (P>0.05). L. japonica resulted in significantly lower agglutination titre, respiratory burst and phagocytic activities than the artificial diets supplemented with 40 or 800 mg PN kg-1 (P<0.05). Total haemocyte count (THC), serum protein concentration, and the activities of lysozyme and acid phosphatase were not significantly affected by the dietary treatments (P>0.05). These results demonstrate that dietary deficiency of pyridoxine suppresses the immune functions in H. discus hannai, and further investigations are needed to optimise the dietary level of this vitamin for maintaining the best immune responses in abalone. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Eight-hundred forty juveniles were distributed into 12 containers. Three formulated diets were prepared in triplicate. A 15% Undaria was included in the control diet. The 15% Undaria was substituted with a same amount of WRB and TSS, referred to as the DRG and TSS diets, respectively. Finally, dry Undaria was also prepared to compare effect of the formulated diets on performance of abalone. The experimental diets were fed to abalone once a day at a satiation level with a little leftover. The feeding trial lasted for 16 weeks. Crude protein, crude lipid, and ash content of the experimental diets changed over all period of time. Higher crude protein and lipid and ash contents retained in all formulated diets compared to the Undaria were observed at 24 and 48 h after seawater immersion. Survival of abalone was not affected by the experimental diets. Weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone fed the TSS diet was greater than all other diets. Weight gain and SGR of abalone fed the control diet was not different from those of abalone fed the WRB diet. Proximates of the soft body of abalone was affected by the diets. In conclusion, WRB and TSS are the promising feed ingredients to replace Undaria in abalone feed; especially, TSS is superior to either Undaria or WRB.

However, traditional methods of probiotic administration in aquaculture are inefficient due to environmental contamination and loss of bacterial viability. This study investigates a new delivery system for delivery of probiotics to H. iris. An extrusion technique coupled with ionotropic gelation was utilized to produce chitosan coated alginate beads (CCALG). Concentration of alginate, chitosan, and coating time were optimized to obtain beads with a desired morphology, stability, sinking time, and release profile. The results showed that increasing alginate concentration up to 1.5% w/w can improve the morphological characteristics of the beads while reducing the sinking time in seawater. Chitosan coating improved the stability of beads and reduced the release of the encapsulated probiotics in seawater. A higher probiotic load was found in the digestive tract of animals fed with CCALG beads ((Formula presented.) compared to the control group ((Formula presented.). High palatability and stability of CCALG beads in seawater combined with controlled release of viable probiotics show that encapsulation of probiotics in CCALG beads is an efficient method for delivery of probiotics in aquaculture. © 2022 The Authors.

Semipurified experimental diets containing graded levels of dietary zinc (5.6-84.6 mg zinc/kg) provided as either ZnMet or ZnSO4 were fed to juvenile abalone in triplicate groups for 16 weeks. The results showed that the average weight gain rate (WGR, %), daily increment in shell length (DISL, μm/day), soft-body alkaline phosphatase activity (SBAKP, U/g protein) and soft-body zinc concentration (SB zinc, μg/g) of the abalone were significantly (ANOVA, P < 0.01) affected by dietary treatment, and responded in broken-line models to increases in dietary zinc levels from the two zinc sources. The requirements for dietary zinc using ZnMet and ZnSO4 as the supplemental zinc sources, determined by broken-line regression analysis, on the basis of maximum WGR were 15.49 and 34.10 mg/kg, respectively, on maximum DISL were 15.16 and 33.99 mg/kg, respectively, on maximum SBAKP were 15.54 and 31.91 mg/kg, and on maximum SB zinc deposition were 17.75 and 34.29 mg/kg, respectively.

The antioxidant enzymes include Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), catalase (CAT), mu-glutathione-s-transferase (mu-GST) and thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx). The results showed that the mRNA expression of these antioxidant enzymes increased and reached the maximum at the dietary zinc level of 33.8 mg/kg, and then dropped progressively. Expression levels of the heat shock proteins (HSP26, HSP70 and HSP90) firstly increased at 33.8 mg/kg dietary Zn level, and reached to the maximum at 710.6 mg/kg, then dropped at 3462.5 mg/kg (p < 0.05). Excessive dietary Zn (710.6 and 3462.5 mg/kg) significantly increases the Zn content and significantly decreases the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in hepatopancreas (p < 0.05).

Fish meal production relies on finite wild-marine resources and is considered as an unsustainable ingredient. Insect meal (IM) is considered a sustainable source with high levels of protein suitable for growth promotion. Grape marc (GM) is a waste byproduct of the winery industry rich in pigments with antioxidant capacity. However, the inclusion of both ingredients can affect the flavor of the meat of abalone and the color of the shell due to different nutritional profiles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the dietary inclusion of IM and GM on the flavor volatile compounds and shell color of the juvenile Haliotis iris in a 165-days feeding trial. Abalone were offered four experimental diets with different levels of IM and GM inclusion and a commercial diet (no IM or GM). Soft bodies of abalone were used to characterize volatile compounds using solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and color changes were analyzed in ground powder of abalone shells using color spectrophotometry 400-700 nm (visible). The results showed 18 volatile compounds significantly different among the dietary treatments. The inclusion of IM did not significantly affect the flavor volatile compounds detected, whereas the inclusion of GM reduced volatile compounds associated with lipid-peroxidation in abalone meat. The inclusion of IM and GM did not significantly affect the lightness nor the yellowness, blueness, redness, and greenness of the ground shells. The supplementation of abalone feeds with GM can help to reduce off-flavour compounds which may extend shelf-life of raw abalone meat.

Six isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets were prepared by adding 0 (control group), 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 mg/kg of bile acids, respectively (named BA0, BA15, BA30, BA60, BA120 and BA240, respectively). It was found that survival of abalone between groups had no significant difference (P > 0.05). Compared to the control, significant improvements in weight gain rate (WGR) were observed in the groups of BA30 and BA60 (P < 0.05). Based on WGR, the broken line regression model analysis showed that the optimum demand for dietary bile acids for abalone was 35.47 mg/kg. Dietary bile acids increased the total anti-oxidative capacity and activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, lysozyme and alkaline phosphatase, meanwhile decreased the content of malondialdehyde, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities in the cell-free hemolymph (P < 0.05). When bile acids were added to the diets, mRNA levels of genes related to pro-inflammatory factors and apoptosis in the digestive gland were down-regulated (P < 0.05). In contrast, the expression of genes related to anti-oxidation was significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05). The Firmicutes, Actinobacteriota and Proteobacteria were the most abundant phyla in intestine. And dietary bile acids significantly decreased the abundance of Actinobacteria and increased the abundance of Firmicutes (P < 0.05). In conclusion, supplementation of dietary bile acids within 120 mg/kg significantly increased the growth of abalone. The 34.62 mg/kg of dietary bile acids significantly increased the anti-oxidative capacity of abalone. Appropriate levels of dietary bile acids (34.62–61.75 mg/kg) promote the immunity of abalone.

Addition of 18:2ω6 and 18: 3ω3 or ω3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (ω3 HUFA, a mixture of 20:5ω3 and 22:6ω3) to the diet improved weight gain and FCE. However, the effect of supplementation of 18:2ω6 or 18:3ω3 on growth and FCE was inferior to that of 20:4ω6 or ω3 HUFA. Feeding 18:2ω6 and 18:3ω3 resulted in elevation of 22:4ω6 and 22:5ω3 in the visceral polar lipids, respectively. However, such an elevation was not apparent in 22:5ω6 and 22:6ω3, suggesting a low ability of abalone to convert 22:4ω6 to 22:5ω6 and 22:5ω3 to 22:6ω3, respectively.

The effects of dietary CUR on the survival and growth of the abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) were evaluated by measuring growth, hematological parameters, and the abundance and diversity of gut flora. A total of 720 abalones (shell length: 59.69 ± 0.15 mm, body weight: 24.80 ± 0.20 g) were randomly distributed into six group (six replicates each group), fed six diets containing 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 g/kg of CUR for 100 days. Results indicated that CUR supplementation at 0.1–0.4 g/kg diet improved the growth performance. When the addition of CUR was greater than 0.1 g/kg, the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and total antioxidant capacity in the serum and hepatopancreas were significantly increased, while the contents of malondialdehyde were significantly reduced (P < 0.05). After infection with Vibrio harveyi AP37, the survival rate in all CUR supplementation groups were significantly higher than the control group (P < 0.05), and the highest values of the total hemocyte count, reactive oxygen species, and phagocytic activity were recorded in CUR 0.1 group. In addition, supplementation of the diet with 0.1 g/kg CUR decreased the gut microbial diversity indices and increased the abundance of potentially beneficial genera including Mycoplasma (26.82%), Psychrilyobacter (23.62%) and Vibrio (21.44%). In conclusion, addition of 0.1 g/kg of CUR to the diet not only improved the survival, growth, feed utilization, and regulated gut flora composition of abalone, but also effectively enhanced their antioxidant capacity, cellular immunity and resistance to V. harveyi AP37 infection. Therefore, CUR may be a useful feed additive for abalone aquaculture. © 2022","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Malgorzata""=>""Excluded"", ""Rebecca""=>""Included"", ""James""=>""Included""} | USER-NOTES: {""Malgorzata""=>[""not lab study"", ""k"", ""not lab study""]}",10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.101336,"",,

This study examines the effect of macroalgae Ulva lactuca and Spyridia filamentosa, cyanobacteria Arthrospira maxima, and microalgae Dunaliella salina on the growth and immunity of Haliotis laevigata, in comparison to a commercially formulated pellet. Over 12 weeks, U. lactuca or S. filamentosa produced the lowest growth rate, indicating lack of nutrients for abalone growth in a single macroalgae diet. Pellets supplemented with 10% A. maxima or D. salina resulted in increased abalone shell length (13.3 and 30.7%, respectively) and body weight (19.9 and 33.4%) over the pellet control diet. The impact of algal supplementation on hemolymph immunity was mainly represented by a drop in total hemocyte counts (THC) and some diet specific effects on superoxide anion and antibacterial activity against Vibrio anguillarum. No effect of diet was observed on phagocytosis, phenoloxidase, or antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1. It is conceived that the humoral antimicrobial factors in abalone hemolymph are innately biosynthesized rather than dietary derived compounds. Nevertheless, concomitant with strong antiviral activity against HSV-1 in a lipophilic extract of U. lactuca and S. filamentosa, higher antiviral activity was detected in the digestive lipid extract of abalone fed U. lactuca (64.2% at 650 μg ml-1) or S. filamentosa (69.51%) compared to abalone fed pellets (47.42%) or pellets supplemented with A. maxima (46.3%) or D. salina (46%). This suggests that abalone may also derive some protection against oral pathogens by algal derived bioactive compounds. These results indicate that abalone growth rate could be optimized by A. maxima and D. salina supplementations, whereas U. lactuca and S. filamentosa could be useful supplements for abalone aquaculture, especially in areas with high risk of herpesvirus infection. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Malgorzata""=>""Included"", ""Rebecca""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.08.009,"",,

In order to investigate this further, the objective of this study was to localise the bacterial probiont Vibrio midae SY9 and one of the extracellular proteases it produces in the digestive tract of the South African abalone Haliotis midae. This was accomplished by inserting a promotorless gfp gene into the chromosome of the bacterium which was incorporated in an artificial, fishmeal-based abalone feed. In situ histological comparison of abalone fed either a basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with V. midae SY9::Tn10.52 using a cocktail of DNA probes to the gfp gene localised the probiont to the crop/stomach and intestinal regions of the H. midae digestive tract. Generally, the ingested probiotic bacterium occurred in association with feed and particulate matter within the crop/stomach and intestinal regions, as well as adhered to the wall of the crop/stomach. Histological immunohistochemical examination using polyclonal anti-VmproA antibodies localised an extracellular protease produced by V. midae SY9 to the H. midae crop/stomach and intestine where it appeared to be associated with feed and/or other particulate matter in the abalone gut. Thus the data suggests that V. midae SY9 colonises and/or adheres to the mucous lining of the abalone gut. Furthermore, the close association observed between the bacterium, its extracellular protease and ingested feed particles supports the theory that V. midae SY9 elevates in situ digestive enzyme levels and thus enhances feed digestion in farmed abalone. © 2014 Huddy, Coyne.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Malgorzata""=>""Included"", ""Rebecca""=>""Included"", ""James""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pseudoreplication?",10.1371/journal.pone.0086623,"",,

Trials were conducted at three farm-relevant acclimation temperatures (12, 17 and 22 °C), and abalone acclimated to the highest temperature were additionally subjected to a simulated heatwave. Within the ranges of 35 and 47 % dietary crude protein, no differences were observed in total postprandial energy use, however, significant differences were observed between the three temperatures. Similarly, differences in nitrogen excretion were observed across temperatures but not across dietary protein treatments. Dietary supplementation of U. lactuca led to significantly higher peak and total ?O throughout the postprandial period at 22 °C. Additionally, total NH4+?N excretion was higher at 17 °C when abalone were fed the U. lactuca supplemented diet. No differences in survival were observed between any of the dietary treatments when juvenile abalone underwent the simulated heatwave, however, the 15 % U. lactuca treatment did exhibit consistently higher ?O.

Results showed that 0.99%–1.95% of dietary DHA contents significantly increased the weight gain rate (WGR) in large size of abalone (P < 0.05), while the WGR in small size of abalone was significantly increased by the 0.46%–0.99% of dietary DHA contents (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the survival of abalone among all the six groups (P > 0.05). Based on the WGR, the optimal dietary DHA content for large and small size abalone were estimated to be 1.32% and 0.88%, respectively. Dietary DHA supplementation significantly increased the activities of trypsin and lipase in the intestine, the content of ?n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and ?n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio in digestive gland in both sizes of abalone (P < 0.05). The total glyceride concentration in the cell-free hemolymph in two sizes of abalone was decreased. In large size of abalone, 1.95%–2.25% of dietary DHA reduced the lipid content in digestive gland. Lipogenic genes in the digestive gland, including sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (srebp-1) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase, were up-regulated in the 0.46%–1.57% DHA group (P > 0.05). The mRNA expression levels of hormone sensitive lipase (hsl) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (cpt-1) of lipolytic genes in the digestive gland were significantly increased in the 0.46% and 0.99% DHA groups, respectively (P < 0.05).

The results showed that 6.3% of dietary lipid decreased the weight gain rate (WGR) of abalone, which increased as the dietary bile acids level increasing from 0 mg/kg to 60 mg/kg. The treatment with the highest WGR contained 4.3% of dietary lipid and 60 mg/kg of dietary bile acids. In the groups with 4.3% of dietary lipid, the expression of genes involved in lipid transport and lipolysis was increased (P < 0.05).

Compared with the group with 0.46% of dietary methionine, 2.07% of dietary methionine significantly increased the concentration of glucose in CFH at 0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 60 h and 84 h, while the concentrations of ammonia were significantly decreased by 2.07% of dietary methionine at each time point after feeding (P < 0.05). The 1.19% of dietary methionine significantly increased the activity of trypsin at 0 h, 24 h 60 h and 84 h after feeding (P < 0.05). The phosphorylation levels of protein kinase B (AKT), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and ribosomal s6 protein (S6) peaked at 12 h and then dropped to base level at 36–84 h. Compared with the group with 0.46% of dietary methionine, 1.19% of dietary methionine significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of AKT at 12 h and 24 h, and extended the phosphorylation time of AKT (P < 0.05). And the phosphorylation level of mTOR was significantly increased by 1.19% of dietary methionine at 12 h, 24 h and 36 h after feeding (P < 0.05). Significant activation or repression of the mRNA levels related to glucose and lipid metabolism were observed at 12–24 h after feeding, and most of which were remain stable at 36–84 h (P < 0.05). The expressions of genes related of insulin signaling pathway (phosphoinositide 3-kinase and protein kinase B), glycolysis (hexokinase) and transport of lipid (fatty acid transport protein) were significantly increased by 1.19% of dietary methionine, while the key gene of gluconeogenesis (glucose-6-phosphatase) were decreased. In summary, 1.19% of dietary methionine could enhance digestive and absorptive capacity, protein synthesis, glucose metabolism and fatty acid transportation of abalone. Take long-term feeding trial with dietary methionine as an example and combine the results of data analysis, it is suggested to analyze the protein level of mTOR signaling pathway within 36 h after feeding, assess the biochemical parameters in CFH and the mRNA levels of nutrient metabolism related genes within 36–84 h, and detect the activities of digestive and absorptive enzymes within 60–84 h. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Malgorzata""=>""Excluded"", ""Rebecca""=>""Included""} | USER-NOTES: {""Malgorzata""=>[""cages""]}",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.741473,"",,

The use of biofouling Sargassum horneri (SH) as additional macroalgal biomass for abalone has been studied, albeit full inclusion is discouraged due to low utilization. This study applied heat treatment and fermentation to increase the nutritive value of SH meals for the aquaculture feed industry. Untreated (UN) as control, heat treated (HT, 121°C for 20 min), and fermented (FE, 107 CFU/mL each of Bacillus sp. SJ-10 and Bacillus sp.

The crude protein, lipid, and ash composition of edible abalone flesh were similarly unaffected (P > 0.05). The gut microbiota profile of abalone was analyzed through next-generation sequencing. The ?-diversity indicators (microbial richness and abundance) were statistically similar (P > 0.05), and the ?-diversity of operational taxonomic units revealed short distances within samples and clustering among diet groups. The core phyla (Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Tenericutes) and genera (Psychrilyobacter, Vibrio, Mycoplasma) known to inhabit the gut of abalone predominantly were likewise identified irrespective of diets; however, there is a difference in their relative abundance. Genus Psychrilyobacter was relatively abundant in UN and FE compared with HT, whereas Vibrio and Mycoplasma had higher abundance in FE and HT-fed abalone, respectively. Taste sensory attributes were discriminated in the abalone meat using an electronic tongue. Principal component analysis of sensor scores revealed several overlapping points, resulting in a negative discrimination index (-184), which means no apparent difference in the general taste profile was detected.

The experimental diets were fed to abalone at a level 1-1.5% from total body weight once a day for twelve weeks feeding period. The results showed that final weight, weight gain, specific growth rate, final shell length, shell length gain and total hemocyte count were not significantly influenced by dietary inosine 5’-monophosphate. However, the total hemocyte count of abalone fed nucleotides-supplemented diets was higher than the control diet. Thus, the present study indicated that inclusion of purine nucleotides, particularly inosine 5’-monophosphate in the practical diet, did not show to improve growth of abalone.

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) has a positive effect on inhibiting nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B)-mediated inflammation. The underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear, particularly in mollusks. Consequently, this study will investigate the process of vitamin D3/VDR regulating NF-?B pathway and further explore their functions on inflammation, autophagy, and apoptosis in abalone Haliotis discus hannai. Results showed that knockdown of VDR by using siRNA and dsRNA of VDR in vitro and in vivo led to more intense response of NF-?B signaling to lipopolysaccharide and higher level of apoptosis and autophagy. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulation after VDR silencing could partially alleviate apoptosis and induce autophagy. Overexpression of VDR restricted the K48-polyubiquitin chain-dependent inhibitor of ?B (I?B) ubiquitination and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) oligomerization. Besides, VDR silencing resulted in increase of ASC speck formation. In further mechanistic studies, we showed that VDR can directly bind to I?B and IKK1 in vitro and in vivo. In the feeding trial, H&E staining, TUNEL, and electron microscope results showed that vitamin D3 deficiency (0 IU/kg) could recruit more basophilic cells and increase more TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells and lipid droplets (LDs) than vitamin D3 supplement (1000 IU/kg and 5000 IU/kg). In summary, abalone VDR plays a negative regulator role in NF-?B-mediated inflammation via interacting with I?B and inhibiting ubiquitin-dependent degradation of I?B.

We also identified a significant correlation between color-difference values (a*) and total carotenoid content (TCC) (R2 = 0.955, p < 0.05), suggesting the TCC in abalone foot muscle can be estimated using the a* value. Furthermore, introducing carotenoids to formulated feed imparts an orange hue to the foot muscle, but this effect is inferior compared to using Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis with a similar carotenoid content. This suggests that H. gigantea has a higher absorption efficiency for the carotenoids from the macroalgae G. lemaneiformis compared to formulated feed. Growth assessments indicate that the formulated feed, enriched with higher crude protein than G. lemaneiformis, optimally supports H. gigantea growth. Our findings furnish valuable insights that could steer breeding strategies and feeding practices towards achieving the orange-footed muscle trait in H. gigantea. © 2023 by the authors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Malgorzata""=>""Excluded"", ""Rebecca""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Does not investigate dietary supplement | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong drug",10.3390/fishes8090443,"",,

While there is a dearth of comprehensive investigation into the effects of these feeding patterns on the temporal dynamics of enzyme activity, and intestinal microbiome of abalone. In this study, a total of 3600 juvenile Pacific abalones were allocated to 12 tanks, randomly divided into four groups based on the feeding patterns: fresh kelp (labeled as FK), salted kelp (SK), formulated feed (FF), and starved group (S). After a 60-day feeding trial, the results showed that abalone in the FK, SK, and FF groups exhibited significant positive effects on both weight and shell growth compared to the S group (P<0.05). Notably, the FF group displayed the highest values of the growth performance. The activity of digestive enzymes and antioxidant enzymes in the FF group had an up-regulated trend over the course of feeding trial, whereas amylase and lipase activity in abalone declined along with starvation. Moreover, the microbial Shannon index showed an overall decreasing trend over time in the FF, FK, and SK groups except for the S group. The ANOSIM analysis revealed that both feeding pattern and cultivating time significantly influenced the structure of the microbial communities. Across the feeding trial, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteriota, and Firmicutes were identified as the dominant phyla in the intestinal microbiome of abalone under different feeding patterns. The core genera were Psychrilyobacter, Mycoplasma, and Vibrio. Additionally, the neutral model analysis revealed that stochastic processes both play a key role in shaping the assembly of microbial communities in different feeding patterns. This study could offer valuable insights into the impact of different feeding patterns on growth and physiology of abalone, thereby contributing to the enhancement of management strategies in the northern Chinese abalone aquaculture industry. © 2024 The Authors","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Malgorzata""=>""Excluded"", ""Rebecca""=>""Excluded"", ""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Does not investigate dietary supplement | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong drug | USER-NOTES: {""Malgorzata""=>[""no supplementation""]}",10.1016/j.aqrep.2024.102427,"",,

Survival and immune parameters including phagocytic activity, total hemocyte count (THC), and activities of the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were measured. Survival was high at 22 degrees C with no significant differences in mortality between treatments. Irrespective of this, exposure to elevated water temperature (25 degrees C) resulted in significantly higher mortalities for all diet treatments (P < 0.05), without any effect of diet. Low ferric reducing antioxidant potential values were observed for all diets. Phagocytic activity remained stable for all temperature and OS treatments (48.82% +/- 1.31%). The dietary inclusion of OS and increased water temperature increased the THC compared with the commercial control diet treatment at 22 degrees C.

Limitations on the availability and use of fish meal through EU directives (EC Regulation 999/2001 & EC Regulation 183/2005) are focussing research efforts to find alternative sources of protein for aquaculture feeds. Marine algae, although low in protein, are widely being considered as a potential alternative to fish meal as not only do they have the potential to impart additional health benefits when ingested but they can also be cultured under enrichment conditions to enhance their nutritional profile as a feed additive. For abalone (a marine gastropod mollusc), several studies have highlighted the benefits of a diet of fresh mixed species seaweed for cultivation. However, the performance of a mixed species marine algae meal, consisting of Laminaria digitata meal, Palmaria palmata meal and Ulva lactuca meal, in a formulated diet for abalone has not apparently been investigated. In this study, the performance of five novel, isonitrogenous, konjac glucomannan-xanthan gum (KX) bound feeds for the abalone Haliotis discus hannai were evaluated in a 12-week experimental growth trial. Comparisons were made between a basal diet formulation (Diet A), a basal diet + lipids + choline chloride (Diet B) and diets containing mixed seaweed meal (Diet C) or fish meal (Diet D) or mixed seaweed meal + fish meal (Diet E). Freshly harvested L. digitata was included as a natural feed type and experimental control. Dry matter leaching was assessed and no significant differences in the dry matter loss over 3 and 4 days were observed between the experimental KX feeds, although L. digitata was a significantly more sea water stable feed type. Daily food consumption (DFC) of Diet C and Diet E was significantly lower than that of fresh L. digitata and the DFC of Diet D was significantly higher than that of L. digitata. Diet E had significantly higher food conversion efficiency than L. digitata, Diet A, Diet B and Diet D. There was no difference in the protein efficiency ratio (PER) between the formulated diets but the PER of Diet D was significantly different to L. digitata. L. digitata had significantly higher linear growth rates than Diet B, and significant differences in the specific growth rates were observed between Diet A and Diet D only. No significant differences in body weight to shell length ratios and percentage survival between treatments were observed. This study highlights the potential for a mixed species seaweed meal as a fish meal replacement in formulated feeds for abalone. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

Four replicates were allocated per treatment with 15 abalone per tank and abalone were fed to excess daily. All experimental diets were formulated to contain 35% crude protein, 5% crude lipid and 17.5 MJ kg(-1) gross energy. In addition, a commercial diet was also fed to abalone and compared with the 0% diet. Growth and feed utilisation of greenlip abalone fed the commercial diet and the 0% basal diet were similar. Greenlip abalone fed any Acti-Meal inclusion level (5, 10, 15 and 20%) exhibited significantly superior growth to abalone fed the 0% basal diet. Notably, in comparison to the basal diet, specific growth rate and biomass gain were improved by 5 to 6% and 10 to 12% respectively. The improvements were achieved despite greenlip abalone consuming significantly less feed (similar to 9%) when fed the Acti-Meal diets. Greenlip abalone fed diets with Acti-Meal also exhibited superior apparent feed conversion ratios compared to those fed the 0% basal diet, on average FCRs were reduced by 13%. We recommend dietary inclusions of up to 20% Acti-Meal to improve greenlip abalone growth.

Accordingly, the experimental diets were named as A0, A4, A8 and A16. After 120-days feeding trial, the best growth performance was observed in A8 group (P < 0.05) and there was no significant difference in A0, A4 and A16 groups. With the increase of dietary MOS, the activity of the total antioxidant capacity in hepatopancreas is increasingly elevated (P < 0.05) while no significant difference was observed on activity of glutathione S-transferase (P > 0.05). The activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were firstly increased and then decreased, with the highest values in A8 group (P < 0.05). Immune-related parameters were significantly affected by dietary MOS inclusion. Specifically, the activities of alkaline phosphatase and acid phosphatase in hepatopancreas and serum of abalone fed diets containing MOS were significantly higher than those of control AO group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the highest values of both enzymes were observed in hepatopancreas of A8 group but in serum of A16 group, respectively.

The results showed that weight gain rate (WGR) was highest in the group with 1.21 mg/kg of dietary Cr. Based on the broken-line regression analysis for WGR, the dietary Cr requirement of abalone was estimated to be 1.32 mg/kg. With the increase of dietary Cr level from 0.04 to 1.21 mg/kg, the total anti-oxidative capacity and lysozyme activity in the cell-free hemolymph were increased and then decreased when the dietary Cr level exceeded 1.21 mg/kg.

The polyphenol content was quantified in EA01 and EA02, and the stability and hardness of all three feeds were measured at 24 h after immersion. Feed preference was evaluated through attraction and consumption tests on day 1, 6, and 12. The polyphenol concentration was reduced by 41% in EA02 (13.9 mg GAE g(-1)) compared to that of EA01 (33.3 mg GAE g(-1)). Both formulated feeds showed 88% stability and hardness values > 680 g cm(-2), which were greater than those of the control (ER03, 66% and 285 g cm(-2), respectively). Abalone were more attracted to EA02 and ER03 on day 1, 6, and 12 than to EA01 on the same days. A similar trend was observed with consumption. EA02 and ER03 were the most consumed feeds (> 6 g day(-1)) throughout the experiment, and no significant differences in consumption were observed between these feeds. On the other hand, juvenile H. fulgens showed a greater attraction to and consumption of EA02 (reduced polyphenol content) than EA01 (no reduction in polyphenol content).

Subsequent investigations showed the higher energy density of the diets was achieved through the addition of fish oil. Given abalone's low requirement for lipids and the small amount of lipase in their gut, it was hypothesized that high levels of dietary lipid depresses the digestibility of other nutrients, such as amino acids, by restricting the action of digestive enzymes. A series of isonitrogenous diets containing 30, 60, or 90 g/kg of either jack mackerel oil or olive oil were formulated and fed to juvenile Haliotis laevigata to determine the apparent fecal digestibilities of dry matter, gross energy, nitrogen (N), and amino acids. inclusion of jack mackerel oil in manufactured abalone feeds at levels above 60 g/kg decreased the digestion of dietary N and amino acids, and inclusion at levels above 30 g/kg decreased gross energy digestion. Oil type also influenced the apparent fecal digestibility of N, amino acids, and gross energy. Olive oil inclusion had significantly different effects on the digestion of these parameters when compared with jack mackerel oil; however, these differences were minimal up to inclusion levels of 30 g/kg. It was concluded that the addition of marine or Vegetable oils to manufactured abalone diets should be limited to 30 g/kg if the digestibility of N, amino acids, and gross energy is not to be affected and that the addition of oils to increase dietary energy levels in abalone diets may not be a cost-effective strategy and may be detrimental to both energy and protein supply.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""}",,"",,

On the basis of the pooled WGR and DISL, the optimum ranges of dietary available phosphorus were 0.65-1.17% (approximately 0.7-1.2% total P), and 0.64-1.14% (approximately 0.7-1.2% total P), respectively. Based on these results, about 1.15% available phosphorus (1.25% of total P) is recommended for the maximum growth of H. discus hannai, and if dietary available phosphorus is reduced from 1.15% to 0.65%, the growth of the abalone may be depressed with 5% likelihood. The calcium/phosphorus ratio of the diets is not important within the range assessed (approximately 0.1:1-9.0:1). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the present study, we hypothesised that kelp supplementation in formulated feed affects the profile of digestive enzymes in farmed Haliotis midae. Commercially reared sub-adult abalone fed a kelp-supplemented (Ecklonia maxima; 0.88% dry weight) or kelp-free control feed were collected for analysis of the amylase, alginate lyase, laminarinase, fucoidanase and protease activities in the gut. Levels of polysaccharidase and protease activity did not significantly differ between the diet treatments. However, enzyme-activity levels were more variable in abalone fed the kelp-free diet as compared with those fed the kelp-supplemented diet (coefficients of variation: 73%, 48.3-60.2% and 31.9% [control diet] versus 42.7%, 13.6-33.8% and 14.6% [KS diet] for amylase, macroalgal polysaccharidases and acid protease activity, respectively). We suggest that the presence of dietary kelp modulates the abalone's gut bacteria and their nutrient exchange. Proteomic identification of proteins in abalone gut sections showed that exogenous enzymes associated with the gut microbiome aid in bacterial utilisation of digested molecules, whereas abalone endogenous enzymes degrade the macronutrients in formulated feeds.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""}",10.2989/1814232X.2017.1329166,"",,

The prophylactic use of probiotic microorganisms has been shown to enhance the health, growth and nutritional status of a variety of cultured aquaculture species. Furthermore, research has shown that H. midae fed a high protein artificial diet supplemented with the proteolytic marine bacterium Vibrio midae SY9 have enhanced digestive protease activity levels, protein digestion and absorption, and growth. The predominant V. midae SY9 extracellular alkaline protease, VmproA, has been previously shown to be present in the crop/stomach and intestinal regions of H. midae fed a diet supplemented with V. midae SY9. Therefore, VmproA may be responsible for the probiotic properties of the bacterium in farmed abalone. In this study, the role of VmproA on abalone growth was investigated using the mutant strain V. midae SY9Mut2, which is unable to produce VmproA. Over the course of a 180 day laboratory-based growth trial the growth rate of small ( 28 mm) abalone improved by 6.5 and 14.5% following dietary supplementation with V. midae SY9 and V. midae SY9Mut2, respectively, in comparison to abalone fed a basal diet. In situ protease activity within the H. midae digestive tract was significantly increased in animals fed the V. midae SY9 supplemented diet compared to abalone fed either the basal feed or the V. midae SY9Mut2 supplemented diet. Thus, VmproA does not appear to be the factor responsible for increased growth of probiotic-supplemented abalone. Statement of relevance: The manuscript addresses the mechanism of how probiotics function in a farmed abalone species. This is important since probiotic supplementation of feed is proving successful in increasing the growth of these molluscs, and yet very little is known regarding the underlying relationship between the host animal and the probiont.

In a 90-day study, the growth and nutrient utilization of juvenile greenlip abalone (1.82 g, 23.23 mm) fed diets containing Ulva sp. protein extract (UPE) were investigated. Animals were fed one of the four formulated test diets containing graded levels of UPE (0%, 5%, 10%, and 20%) or a commercial diet that served as a control for the 0% basal diet. Diets were formulated to contain 37% crude protein, 5% lipid, and 17.5 MJ/ kg gross energy. The specific growth rate and shell growth rate (mm/day) of abalone fed the four experimental diets were similar. Dietary inclusions of UPE supported the growth of juvenile greenlip abalone and may be used to reduce dietary inclusions of solvent extracted soybean meal, dehulled lupins, and wheat flour. Currently, UPE is cost prohibitive for commercial use in greenlip abalone diet. As UPE is a by-product of the macroalgae industry, the cost of UPE would likely become more economically viable as macroalgae production increases in the future to include in diets for greenlip abalone. Once economically viable, we recommend a dietary inclusion of up to 20% UPE meal for greenlip abalone.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""}",10.2983/035.036.0325,"",,

Two experiments were conducted over 93 days to test the effect of diet on the colour of the foot and shell of 1-year old greenlip abalone Haliotis laevigata. In Experiment 1, a commercial control diet and two species of fresh macroalgae (Gracilaria cliftonii and Ulva sp.) were used and each macroalgae species was either non-enriched or enriched with nutrients in the culture media. The shell of abalone fed the commercial diet and fresh Ulva sp. was green but abalone fed fresh G. cliftonii developed a brown shell. The fresh G. cliftonii increased shell colour purity while fresh Ulva sp. increased shell brightness. Feeding abalone with either fresh Ulva or fresh G. cliftonii produced yellowish foot. Nutrient enrichment of algae did not significantly affect the pigment contents in both macroalgae and abalone, and had minimal impact on the colour of shell and foot. With the exception of zeaxanthin, the pigment contents were significantly lower in fresh G. cliftonii than in fresh Ulva sp. Moreover, beta-carotene was the main pigment in abalone fed both species of fresh macroalgae. In Experiment 2, the inclusion of dietary dried algae affected abalone colour. Three diets including a commercial control diet, a diet containing 3% dried Spirulina sp. and a diet containing 10% dried Ulva sp. were used. The shell of abalone fed dried Spirulina sp. was yellow-brown with higher colour purity while the shell remained light green in abalone fed dried Ulva sp. or the commercial control diet.

For ingested feed energy, 20% enriched Ulva sp. meal inclusion resulted in significantly higher values compared to either the commercial diet, control diet or the two other enriched Ulva sp. meal diets. However, abalone fed the 20% dried Ulva sp. meal diet lost significantly more energy through faecal egestion than those fed the commercial or the 0% control diets, suggesting reduced diet digestibility with increasing enriched Ulva sp. inclusion. The majority of ingested feed energy was allocated to somatic growth across treatments, while shell growth energy accounted for the smallest proportion of the energy budgets. Results suggest that the inclusion of enriched G. cliftonii meal (10% inclusion optimum) in formulated diets for Greenlip Abalone has energetic benefits for feed utilisation and growth which may lead to improved business productivity. Inclusion of selected macroalgae species in formulated diets for abalone is an approach where the benefits from feeding live macroalgae can be successfully transferred into these diets.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735816,"",,

A major risk factor for this sector is slow growth rates experienced during farming. Abalone feeds are often supplemented with amino acids in an attempt to enhance abalone growth. This is a first investigation of the effect of added proline to standard abalone feed, on the metabolite profile of slow-growing abalone. A targeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics research approach was followed to recognise the metabolic response of abalone showing slower growth performance. The addition of proline to the standard abalone diet was found to serve as a substrate for amino acid catabolism in slower growing abalone, by means of proline breakdown to assist with energy production via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Other amino acids and urea cycle intermediates, that is, arginine, asparagine, ornithine and creatine further support energy production via the action of protein catabolism in slow-growing abalone. Additionally, the importance of understanding how abalone respond metabolically to modified feed highlights the use of metabolomics to answer abalone aquaculture farming questions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included"", ""James""=>""Included""}",10.1111/are.13978,"",,

It however has been suffering Vibrio alginolyticus infections, which cause mass death of small abalone and thus great economic losses, particularly in artificial aquaculture. In this study, we attempted to treat small abalone with anti-Vibrio IgY to elicit a passive immunity directly against V. alginolyticus infections. Anti-Vibrio IgY was alginate encapsulated in egg powders as feed, which may avoid antibody inactivation in the gastrointestinal tract of small abalone. The feed was tested for the stability of anti-Vibrio IgY in a gastrointestinal mimic environment. The result showed anti-Vibrio IgY retained activity as high as 90% after 4 h exposure to pancreatic enzymes. Addition of 0, 5 or 10% anti-Vibrio IgY-encapsulated egg powders into a basal diet to form abalone diet formulae. Small abalones fed with the anti-Vibrio IgY formulae showed a relatively high respiratory burst activity than those without anti-Vibrio IgY treatments.

This is a particular concern for aquaculture industries due to the economic impacts of such events. Diets containing algal supplements have been suggested as pre-emptive solutions for preventing these mass mortalities. The same has also been suggested for diets containing grape seed extract. This is due to their potential as a source of antioxidative compounds, which reduce the accumulation of harmful reactive oxygen species. This study aimed to identify functional genes associated with high survival in abalone fed diets high in antioxidative compounds during heat stress. Tentacle transcriptomes of 40 greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) were investigated to determine the combined effects of differing diets and temperature on the gene expression responses by abalone. Here we compare the functional gene expression changes at 22 degrees C and 25 degrees C in abalone fed common commercial, live macroalgal (Ulva lactuca) and grape seed extract supplemented commercial diets as a means to understand the resulting high survival of abalone fed grape seed extract during heat stress. Twenty-four genes were differentially expressed between high survival promoting diets (macroalgae or grape seed extract supplemented commercial) relative to the purely commercial diet. Many of these genes have been suggested to be involved in antioxidant and innate immunity responses. The identification of these genes and their functional roles has enhanced our understanding of processes that contribute to summer stress resilience in abalone.

The immune- stimulating potential of two hydrolysed protein sources (self-prepared fish silage and a commercial fish protein hydrolysate) at two dietary inclusion levels in abalone diets was therefore measured in the South African abalone Haliotis midae, using animals of initial mean weight of 123 g-128 g. Diets containing the high inclusion levels were also fed in two feeding regimes: continuous feeding, or phase feeding, where the hydrolysed protein diets were alternated monthly with the control diet. In low inclusion diets, hydrolysate inclusion contributed 6 g center dot kg(-1) protein in the final diet, whilst in high inclusion diets this was increased to 18 g center dot kg(-1). It was found that the low inclusion level of the commercial hydrolysate significantly increased the cellular immunity through increasing the phagocytic activity of haemocytes by 18% compared to the control diet, whilst none of the other diets showed any significant differences compared to the control. Both inclusion levels of the commercial hydrolysed protein significantly improved daily weight increase of animals. Phase feeding had no positive impacts on immunity or production performance. The inclusion of both types of hydrolysed protein sources significantly decreased the water stability of feeds compared to the control, except at the lowest inclusion level of the commercial hydrolysate.

These data suggest that the probiotic-supplemented diet can also alter central carbon metabolic processes, which may improve the survival, as well as the growth of abalone.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.fsi.2018.08.034,"",,

Recent research suggests that temperature-induced tissue breakdown allows bacteria entry to the host, and nutritional supplementation can alleviate this breakdown. The aim of this study was to alleviate mortality of greenlip abalone, Haliotis laevigata, cultured at high summer water temperatures (25 degrees C) by dietary intervention using graded levels of peanut skin extract (PE; 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5%), green tea extract (GTE; 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5%) and vitamin C (1.0% vitamin C; 1.0% vitamin C + 1.0% GTE; and 1.0% vitamin C + 1.0% PE) in a commercial diet; these supplements contain antioxidant and bioactive compounds. The commercial diet containing 5.0% Australian grapeseed extract (GSE) fed at 25 degrees C was also included as a negative temperature/positive diet control due to improved survival and health of abalone at high temperatures in our previous study. Three-year-old abalone (49.21 g; 70.26 mm) were fed the commercial diet at 22 degrees C (positive temperature control), and the commercial diet (negative temperature control) and test diets at 25 degrees C for 38 days. Abalone survival was 85% for the commercial diet at 22 degrees C, whereas survival of abalone was significantly reduced to 40% when fed the commercial diet at 25 degrees C. There were no significant differences in survival of abalone fed the commercial diet at 22 degrees C and those fed 5.0% GSE, 0.5% GTE and 2.5% GTE diets at 25 degrees C. Supplements did not significantly affect oxygen consumption, ammonia excretion rates and total hemocyte count. Abalone fed 5.0% GTE had significantly lower phagocytic activity than those fed the commercial control diet at 22 degrees C. Supplementation with PE and vitamin C had no beneficial effects on survival, while GTE holds promise as a potential dietary additive to enhance the survival of abalone at higher water temperature. This study confirms that supplementation of 5.0% GSE in the commercial diet also improves the survival of greenlip abalone cultured at high summer water temperature in the laboratory setting. Statement of relevance: Purported to have diverse health benefits including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties, 5% Australian grape extract, graded levels of green tea extract, peanut skin extract and vitamin C were supplemented in a commercial abalone diet in order to improve survival of greenlip abalone at high water temperature.

Results showed that the daily increment in shell length (DISL) of abalone in the treatment with 1 x 10(3) IU vitamin A per kilogram diet was significantly higher than that with 0 or 1 x 10(6) IU vitamin A per kilogram supplementation (P < 0.05). Vitamin A deficiency (0 IU/kg) significantly elevated the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reductase (GR) in the viscera of abalone (P < 0.05). In muscle, the effects of vitamin A deficiency on SOD and GPX activities were the same as those in viscera, however, the activity of GR significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Vitamin A deficiency significantly decreased the ratio of CAT to SOD (catalase/superoxide dismutase) in viscera (P < 0.05). Nevertheless, it significantly decreased the ratio of GR to GPX in muscle (P < 0.05). Compared with the supplement of 1 x 10(3) IU vitamin A per kilogram, excessive vitamin A (1 x 10(6) IU/kg) had no significant effects on the activities of CAT, SOD and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) (P > 0.05), but significantly elevated GPX and GR activities in viscera (P < 0. 05). In muscle, the activities of CAT, SOD, GPX, GST and GR were significantly decreased by the excessive dietary vitamin A supplement (P < 0.05).

Levels of mannitol acquired using submerged liquid fermentation were 1.8 times higher than those acquired using the hot-water method, and polysaccharides were efficiently hydrolyzed to form oligosaccharides with an average molecular weight of approximately 3300 Da. Furthermore, a 2-month experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of U. prolifera fermentation extracts on the growth performance of juvenile abalone (Haliotis discus hannai Ino). Diets containing algae fermentation extracts in concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 1% significantly increased linear shell growth rate (LGR), weight growth rate (WGR), and specific growth rate (SGR). Diets supplemented with fermentation extracts in concentrations of 0.5 and 1% significantly increased the degree of green coloration in the shell.

The full-length cDNA of HdhHSP90 was of 2660 bp, including an open reading frame (ORF) of 2187 bp encoding a polypeptide of 728 amino acids with predicted molecular weight of 84.134 kDa and theoretical isoelectric point of 4.619. BLAST analysis revealed that HdhHSP90 shared high similarity with other known HSP90s, and the five conserved amino acid blocks defined as HSP90 protein family signatures were also identified in HdhHSP90, which indicated that HdhHSP90 should be a cytosolic member of the HSP90 family. The expression levels of HdhHSP90 in haemocytes and hepatopancreas were measured by real-time PCR after Pacific abalone were fed with semi-purified diets containing graded levels of selenium (0.15, 1.32 and 48.70 mg Kg(-1)) for 20 weeks, respectively. The results showed that the expression levels of HdhHSP90 transcript were significantly up-regulated and reached the maximum (0.47-fold) in hepatopancreas of Pacific abalone fed with optimal dietary Se (1.32 mg Kg(-1)) (p < 0.05).

In the current study juvenile H. midae were exposed for one month to two constant temperatures (14 degrees C and 19 degrees C), with three oxygen levels (82%, 98% and 126% oxygen saturation) at each temperature. One additional treatment was included at 19 degrees C, 126% oxygen, where feed was supplemented with L-proline. The results presented here suggest that long-term 19 degrees C exposure is more stressful to H. midae juveniles than a 14 degrees C exposure of the same duration, since exposure to higher temperature generally resulted in higher activities of the antioxidant enzymes measured but lower total antioxidant capacities. Haemolymph glucose levels responded to oxygen treatment at the 14 degrees C exposure, but the same response was not initiated in the 19 degrees C treatment, possibly because the animals exposed to the 19 degrees C treatment relied on proteins to a larger extent. Increased oxygen levels at the 19 degrees C treatment did not cause more DNA damage or protein carbonylation compared to lower oxygen levels. Supplementing feed with L-proline at the high temperature/high oxygen treatment caused a decrease in haemolymph haemocyanin (which may exhibit catalase function) content and a slight decrease in some of the antioxidant enzyme activities, while maintaining the same total antioxidant capacity compared with the same treatment where feed was not supplemented. The overall DNA integrity profile also changed with proline-supplementation, as did the induction level of hsp70. When projecting tissue growth over a 12 month period under these conditions, we estimate that H. midae juveniles in this study may exhibit a significant increase in mass when their feed was supplemented with L-proline, indicating that L-proline supplementation provides some benefit to the individual. It might therefore warrant conducting long-term growth trials on land-based mariculture facilities to further investigate its potential benefit to the mariculture industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Seven semi-purified diets with graded levels of AA (0, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 5000 mg/kg) were fed to abalone (initial weight: 12.01 +/- 0.001 g, initial shell length: 48.44 +/- 0.069 mm) for 100 days. The survival, weight gain rate and daily increment in shell length were not affected by dietary AA. The AA content in the gill, muscle and digestive glands of abalone was significantly increased by dietary AA. In terms of immunity, dietary AA significantly improved the total hemocyte count, respiratory burst and phagocytic activity in hemolymph, and lysozyme activity in cell-free hemolymph (CFH). In the digestive gland, the TLR-MyD88-dependent and TLR-MyD88-independent signaling pathways were suppressed by dietary AA supplementation. The mRNA levels of beta-defensin and arginase-I in the digestive gland were significantly increased by dietary AA. In the gill, only the TLR-MyD88-dependent signaling pathway was depressed by dietary AA to reduce inflammation in abalone. The level of mytimacin 6 in the gill was significantly upregulated by dietary AA. After Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection, the TLR signaling pathway in the digestive gland was suppressed by dietary AA, which reduced inflammation in the abalone. In terms of anti-oxidation, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities, as well as total anti-oxidative capacity and reduced glutathione content in CFH, were all significantly upregulated. The malondialdehyde content was significantly downregulated by dietary AA. The anti-oxidative capacity was improved by triggering the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway in abalone. In terms of apoptosis, dietary AA could enhance the anti-apoptosis ability via the JNK-Bcl-2/Bax signaling cascade in abalone.

Results showed that weight gain rate (WGR) were highest in 1.83 % dietary phospholipids level. Based on the quadratic regression analysis for WGR, the optimal dietary phospholipids level for abalone was estimated to be 1.57 %. The contents of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in abalone muscle increased gradually with the increase of dietary phospholipids levels. A total of 25 volatile flavor compounds were detected in the muscle of abalone by gas chromatograph-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS), including 9 aldehydes, 6 esters, 4 ketones, 3 alcohols and 3 hydrocarbons. The content of some volatile flavor compounds with pleasant aroma in the muscle of abalone increased significantly when fed with diets containing 1.83 % and 2.48 % of phospholipids. Lipidomics analysis showed that dietary phospholipids could affect the lipid composition in the muscle by reducing the synthesis and promoting the decomposition of phospholipids. Among 244 differential lipids identified by lipidomics, phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) were the main species, accounting for more than 50 % of them. Partial least squares regression (PLS-R) analysis showed that the changes of volatile flavor compounds in the muscle of abalone was strongly related to PCs and PEs.

However, excessive Se can have various toxic effects on aquatic animals. In this study, we performed transcriptome analysis to determine the mechanism by which immunity and growth of abalone are affected by toxic dietary concentrations of Se. Four experimental diets were administered to supplement organic Se at concentrations of 0.00 (Control), 0.15 (Se15), 0.30 (Se30), and 0.60 mg/kg (Se60) to provide 0.16 (insufficient), 0.32 (optimal), 0.44 (super nutritional), and 0.60 mg/kg (toxic) Se concentrations in the diet. After feeding for 100 days, the results of the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that the enriched GO terms of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Se15 and Se30 groups were mainly focused on the cellular components, whereas the GO terms enriched in the Se60 group were mainly related to the metabolism of nutrients and the activities of various enzymes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the DEGs of the Se30 group were mainly enriched in various disease pathways, whereas the DEGs of the Se60 treatment were associated with the metabolism of various nutrients. Further analysis of DEGs showed that toxic dietary concentrations of Se decreased the immunity of abalone by affecting the biosynthesis and metabolism pathways of various nutrients. Additionally, toxic dietary concentrations of Se retarded the growth of abalone by decreasing the expression of various genes associated with shell formation, including lustrin A, perlucin, perlustrin, dermatopontin, chitin synthase, and chitinase as well as the genes associated with muscle production, including collagen, myosin heavy chain, myosin essential light chain, and paramyosin.

Four diets (a commercial reference and iso-nutrient diets containing fish silage oil, unprocessed rainbow trout viscera or shrimp protein hydrolysate) were evaluated both with and without addition of 2 g kg(-1) dietary formic acid, thus yielding a total of eight treatments, in feeding trials with cultured South African abalone Haliotis midae. Results indicated that inclusion of unprocessed rainbow trout viscera without formic acid decreased production performance of experimental animals, as evidenced by significantly decreased final animal weight and daily weight gain, and significantly increased feed conversion ratio compared to the iso-nutrient control. The decreased production performance was attributed to decreased feed water stability of the diet incorporating untreated trout viscera. Dietary formic acid supplementation partially mitigated the negative impacts of viscera inclusion on production performance of the experimental animals, as seen in significantly higher final animal weight and daily weight gain, and lower feed conversion ratio when compared to non-formic acid-supplemented, viscera-containing diet. However, no beneficial effects on production performance or water stability were found upon formic acid inclusion in diets not containing trout viscera. In conclusion, dietary formic acid can partially mitigate negative impacts on production performance when unprocessed trout viscera are included in formulated abalone diets by improving feed water stability, but the exact mechanism by which this is achieved was not established.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included"", ""James""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s10499-018-0257-z,"",,

This was also true for K-2-MK-7, but in the visceral organ only. Vitamin K-1 inclusion level did not significantly affect total hemocyte count, phagocytic activity, or phagocytic index (P > 0.05). Increasing water temperature to 25 degrees C resulted in significant increases in serum catalase activity (22 < 25 degrees C) and vitamin K-1 concentration in muscle tissue (22 < 25 degrees C). Comparison of vitamin K-1 or K-3 at 0.5 mg kg(-1) resulted in significant changes to serum catalase activity (K-1 > K-3) and vitamin K-1 concentration in visceral organ (K-1 > K-3). In conclusion, vitamin K-1 at the doses tested, resulted in significant increases in vitamin K-1 concentration in visceral organ and muscle tissues, but failed to improve immune function, oxidative status, or survival of greenlip abalone at high summer water temperatures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""}",10.2983/035.037.0116,"",,

A trend of increased dietary phosphorus leaching from diet pellets with increased water solubility of sources was observed. MSP presented the highest (P<0.05) phosphorus leaching (58.8%), while a value of 14.9% was obtained with DCP. Unexpectedly high phosphorus leaching (48.7% maximum) was obtained for a reference diet consisting of commercial feed ingredients (fish meal, soya bean meal, cottonseed meal) without any phosphorus supplementation. DCP presented a lower (P<0.05) apparent phosphorus digestibility (27.9%) than MSP (66.5%), MCP (72.6%) and MDCP (66.3%). When dietary phosphorus leaching and apparent phosphorus digestibility were take into account, MDCP seems to be the most promising inorganic phosphorus source for inclusion in abalone diets. Further research should concentrate on minimizing dietary phosphorus leaching through feed preparation techniques.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included"", ""James""=>""Included""}",10.1046/j.1365-2095.2003.00238.x,"",,

Juvenile abalone with mean initial weight and shell length of 0.69 +/- 0.04 g and 11.4 +/- 0.35 mm, respectively, were fed practical diets for 84 days at a temperature range of 28-31 degreesC. The practical diets contained 27% crude protein from various sources such as fish meal (FM), shrimp meal (SM), defatted soybean meal (DSM), and Spirulina sp. (SP). A formulated diet (diet 1) served as the control. The diets were fed to abalone at 2-5% body weight once daily at 1600 h. Weight gain (WG), increase in shell length (SL), specific growth rate (SGR), protein efficiency ratio (PER) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were evaluated. Highest weight gain (WG: 454%) was attained with abalone fed diet 2 with protein sources coming from a combination of FM, SM, and DSM. This value was, however, not significantly different (P < 0.05) from those fed diets 4 and I (Control diet) with protein sources coming from FM, SM, SP and FM, DSM, SM, respectively. Abalone fed diet 3, which used both plant protein sources, DSM and SP, showed significantly lower WG (327%). Survival was generally high ranging from 85% to 100% for all treatments. The SGR showed the same trend as the percent weight gain. The FCR and PER obtained, however, were not significantly different for all treatments. The amino acid profile of diets 1, 2, and 4 simulated that of the abalone protein, which could have been a contributing factor to the higher growth rate of abalone fed these diets. Diet 3, which contained only plant protein sources, showed relatively lower methionine values compared with the abalone muscle tissue. Although abalone are considered herbivorous animals, results of this study indicate that a combination of dietary plant and animal protein sources was necessary to attain the best growth rate.

In this study we examine the effect of broodstock diet (three formulated diets differing in levels of the fatty acid, Arachidonic acid [ARA], and a red seaweed diet) and spawning frequency on egg diameter variability both within a batch of eggs spawned from one female and between batches of eggs. Greenlip abalone broodstock were spawned at the beginning of the experiment and again every 16 wks (1131 degrees C days effective accumulative temperature [EAT]) using commercial hatchery practices. The variability of egg diameter within batches spawned from the same female over three consecutive spawning rounds and within diet treatments was determined. Cytoplasm diameter, vitelline layer and jelly coat thickness of unfertilized eggs were also compared between eggs spawned from individual females and between females. In addition. the relationships between broodstock parameters (weight and shell length) and egg diameter were explored. Eggs spawned from females feeding on a red seaweed diet were smaller than eggs from the low ARA treatment. Depending on spawning frequency, broodstock diet can influence the cytoplasm diameter and jelly coat thickness. No relationship between egg diameter and broodstock parameters was found. However, batches spawned from the same female abalone became more variable over time with a shift in size frequency distribution. Results indicate that the variability of egg diameter within a batch changes from female to female and highlights the importance of selecting successful broodstock for conditioning at commercial hatcheries.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""}",10.2983/0730-8000(2006)25[195:IOCDAS]2.0.CO;2,"",,

In this study, slc38a9 of abalone was cloned, and the slc38a9 was knocked down and overexpressed to explore its function in the regulation of the TOR signaling pathway. The results showed that knockdown of slc38a9 decreased the expression of tor, ribosomal s6 protein kinase (s6k) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e (eif4e) and inhibited the activation of the TOR signaling pathway by arginine. Overexpression of slc38a9 up-regulated the expression of TOR-related genes.

However, in the present study, the full-length CDs (Coding sequence) of L-gulonolactone oxidase (GLO) from Pacific abalone ( Haliotis discus hannai Ino) were obtained through molecular cloning. The Pacific abalone GLO contained a FAD-binding domain in the N-termination, and ALO domain and conserved HWAK motif in the C-termination. The GLO gene possesses 12 exons and 11 introns. The Pacific abalone GLO was expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, digestive gland, gill, intestine, muscle and mantle. The GLO activity assay revealed that GLO activity was only detected in the kidney of Pacific abalone. After a 100 -day feeding trial, dietary AA levels did not significantly affect the survival, weight gain, daily increment in shell length, and feed conversion ratio of Pacific abalone. The expression of GLO in the kidney was downregulated by dietary AA. These results implied that the ability to synthesize AA in abalone had not been lost. From the evolutionary perspective, the loss of GLO occurred independently as an independent event by matching with the genomes of various species. The positive selection analysis revealed that the GLO gene underwent purifying selective pressure during its evolution. In conclusion, the present study provided direct evidence to prove that the GLO activity and the ability to synthesize AA exist in abalone.

This study evaluates the impact of macroalgal diets and water temperatures on the colour and tissue pigment deposition in farmed greenlip abalone. Three diets are (a) fresh Ulva sp., (b) a commercial diet and (c) a formulated diet of 30% of dried Ulva sp. meal supplement were used to feed 3-year-old greenlip abalone at either 22 or 26°C for 38 days. Abalone fed 30% dried Ulva sp. meal supplement had significantly higher the shell colour saturation than those fed fresh Ulva sp. The lip colour was deeper in abalone fed fresh Ulva sp. and was significantly more pronounced than those fed the diet containing 30% Ulva sp. meal. Abalone at 22°C had a significantly higher lip colour saturation value than those at 26°C. The foot of abalone fed fresh Ulva sp. was light gold, whereas abalone fed the 30% Ulva sp. meal or the commercial diet had a dark brown foot at 22°C. The foot colour was paler in abalone at 26°C than at 22°C. The content of β-carotene was significantly higher in abalone fed fresh Ulva sp. than those fed the other diets. Abalone contained a higher amount of β-carotene at 22°C than at 26°C.

Three experimental diets were formulated with 0 (Control), 700 (LA-700) and 2100 (LA-2100) mg/kg supplement of LA respectively. Each diet was randomly assigned to three replicates of 50 abalones (initial body weight: 3.17 ± 0.01 g), which were exposed to 0.35 mg/L of waterborne Cd. Results showed that abalones’ Cd bioaccumulation in the serum, mantle, gill, muscle and hepatopancreas were significantly reduced in LA supplement groups. Besides, in hepatopancreas, the activities of antioxidative enzymes and concentration of glutathione (GSH) in LA supplement group were significantly higher than those in control. Meanwhile, in hepatopancreas, LA-2100 group showed a significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and the protein carbonyls in LA supplement groups were significantly lower than those in control. Diets with LA supplementation significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of HdhMTF-1 (H. discus hannai metal-responsive transcription factor-1) and HdhMT (H. discus hannai metallothionein), and elevated metallothionein (MT) concentrations in hepatopancreas. In conclusion, it was suggested that dietary LA could alleviate Cd-induced oxidative damage through enhancing antioxidative enzyme activities and upregulating the HdhMTF-1-mediated HdhMT transcription and synthesis. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Rebecca""=>""Included""}",10.1111/anu.12849,"",,

Dietary inclusion effect of the combined macroalgae (MA) (Undaria pinnatifida and Hizikia fusiforme) and a single Saccharina japonica on abalone was also compared. Three thousand six hundred juvenile abalone were purchased from a private hatchery and acclimated to the experimental conditions for 2weeks. Six 5-ton flow-through raceway tanks were used, and abalone were randomly distributed into tanks (n=600 per tank). Three experimental diets were prepared in duplicate. Fish meal, FSM, corn gluten meal, and shrimp meal and wheat flour and dextrin were used as the protein and carbohydrate sources, respectively, in the FSM diet. MA was also included in the FSM diet. FSM and MA in the FSM diet were substituted with SBM at the expense of wheat flour and S. japonica, referred to as the SBM and SJ diets. The experimental diets were pelletized by an extruded pelleter. Water stability of nutrients in the experimental diets was monitored at 12, 24, and 48h after seawater immersion. The experimental diets were fed to abalone once a day to satiation with a little leftover for 120days. The retained crude protein and lipid and ash content of the extruded pellets were changed over all period of time. Weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone fed the SBM diet were greater than those of abalone fed the FSM and SJ diets. Weight gain and SGR of abalone fed the SJ diet were also greater than those of abalone fed the FSM diet. The longest shell length, widest shell width, highest shell height, and greatest soft body weight were obtained in abalone fed the SBM diet, followed by the SJ and FSM diets. Proximates of the soft body of abalone were not different among the experimental diets. In conclusion, SBM was a superior protein source to FSM in extruded pellet for growth performance of abalone.

Seven experimental diets were formulated to contain increasing amounts (0%, 0.875%, 1.75% and 3.5%) of GO or LO as dietary lipids. Tripalmitin (TP), rich in 16:0, was supplemented to reach 3.5% (dry weight) total lipid. These diets were named as 0%GO/LO (TP), 25%GO, 50%GO, 100%GO, 25%LO, 50%LO and 100%LO. With the increase of dietary GO or LO inclusion, growth parameters (such as specific growth rate of weight) first increased and then decreased (R2>0.72, P=0.000).

We have shown that Haliotis midae fed a probiotic-supplemented diet have an improved survival and growth rate compared to animals not fed probiotics. The growth rate of small (20 mm) and large (67mm) abalone was improved by 8% and 34%, respectively, in two separate eight-month farm growth trials. Furthermore, the number, and phagocytic activity, of circulating haemocytes was significantly higher (P<0.05) in probiotic treated animals compared to non-treated animals following challenge with the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio anguillarum. Seven days after challenging with V. anguillarum, the probiotic-fed animals had 62% survival compared to 25% survival for non-treated animals. In situ protease assays showed that probiotic treatment significantly increased (P<0.05) protease activity in the intestinal region of the digestive tract of animals fed the probiotic-supplemented feed. This correlated with a significant increase (P<0.05) in the amount of protein digestion and absorption measured in this region of the abalone gut. Histological analysis showed that the digestive glands of animals receiving probiotics were bacteria-free, whereas the digestive glands of 70% of the animals receiving the non-supplemented feed had a high bacterial load. The microorganisms tested in this study therefore have tremendous potential as probiotics for commercially produced H. midae. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Juvenile abalone Haliotis discus hannai ino weighing 3.1—4.3 g in live weight (29-34 mm in shell length) were fed on one of the variety of the formulated test diets containing casein or white fishmeal as a protein source, and different levels of sodium alginate, lipid and a mineral mixture, for 30 and 40 days, respectively. The growth rate and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) were compared with those obtained by feeding with live fronds of the alga Eisenia bicyclis as a control, which was known to have high dietary value for this herbivore. Dietary value of the casein diet was found to be comparable or superior to that of the alga. While feeding abalone on a white fishmeal diets resulted in a lower growth and FCE, being about 60% of those compared to the casein diets. These results clearly indicated that the casein diet used in these experiments was suitable as a semipurified test diet for abalone.
