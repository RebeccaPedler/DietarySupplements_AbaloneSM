HaHV-1-challenged paua up-regulated broad classes of genes that contained chitin-binding peritrophin-A domains, which seem to play diverse roles in the paua immune response. The paua also up-regulated vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1), an important adhesion molecule for lymphocytes, and chitotriosidase- 1 (CHIT-1), an immunologically important gene in mammalian immune systems. Moreover, several blood coagulation pathways were dysregulated in the paua, possibly indicating viral modulation. We also saw several indications that neurological tissues were specifically affected by HaHV-1, including the dysregulation of beta-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (B4GALNT), GM2 ganglioside, neuroligin-4 and the Notch signalling pathway. This research may support the development of molecular therapeutics useful to control and/or manage viral outbreaks in abalone culture.",10.3354/dao03390
"Allen, VJ; Marsden, ID; Ragg, NLC; Gieseg, S","The effects of tactile stimulants on feeding, growth, behaviour, and meat quality of cultured Blackfoot abalone, Haliotis iris",2006,AQUACULTURE,257,1-Apr,294,308,,"The New Zealand Blackfoot abalone or paua, Haliotis iris uses both tactile and chemosensory cues to detect and feed on drifting seaweed in its natural habitat. In aquaculture situations, abalone are usually provided with static artificial food pellets, effectively removing the tactile stimulus. This study investigated the effects of tactile stimuli from suspended particles on pellet ingestion, growth, behaviour and meat quality of juvenile paua (length 40-45 mm). Over eleven months, individuals were offered a commercial pellet diet (AbFeed (TM)) and small quantities of one of four particulate materials: macerated seaweed (Gracilaria spp. and Macrocystis pyrifera) and 2 sizes of synthetic PVC fragments. There was seasonal variation in the ingestion rate of abalone from all treatments and the control (no stimulants) with lowest rates during winter (June to September) and highest rates in summer (December to February). The specific growth rate (% body weight gain per day) and shell length increase varied seasonally. Of the four treatments, the only effective stimulant was Gracilaria spp. which resulted in summer shell growth of 110.6 +/- 3.2 pm d(-1) compared with 86.9 +/- 4.0 pm d(-1) for control abalone. Behavioural observations showed that when Gracilaria particles were present, abalone spent > 80% of their time engaged in feeding-related activity. Control abalone, without the algal stimulant, spent most of their time in a sedentary position. None of the particulate stimulants tested had any significant effect on food conversion ratio, water content, protein, lipid and glycogen levels or meat tenderness. These parameters were, however, significantly affected by season. A preliminary trial of the Gracilaria particle treatment in a commercial system over 90 days enhanced the growth of cultured H. iris (45 +/- 5 min shell length) by 15.3%. The main commercial implication of this research is that the addition of algal stimulants is suggested as a cost-effective means of improving abalone performance using pre-existing culture systems and food types.

In this study, survival rates of the abalone, Haliotis diversicolor supertexta, against Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and its non-specific immune parameters such as the total haemocyte count (THC), phenoloxidase (PO) activity, respiratory bursts, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, phagocytic activity, and clearance efficiency to V. parahaemolyticus by H. diversicolor supertexta were determined when abalone (4.5 +/- 0.4 g) were fed diets containing sodium alginate at 0, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 g kg(-1). Abalone fed a diet containing sodium alginate at 2.0 and 3.0 g kg(-1) for 14 days and at 1.0 g kg(-1) for 21 days had significantly higher survival rates than those fed the control diet after challenge with V. parahaemolyticus. The relative survival percentages of abalone fed the 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 g kg(-1) sodium alginate-containing diets for 14 and 21 days were 16.1%, 40.0%, and 48.0%, and 63.6%, 27.3% and 22.6%, respectively. The PO activity, respiratory bursts, SOD activity, and phagocytic activity and clearance efficiency of V. parahaemolyticus of abalone fed the sodium alginate-containing diets at 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 g kg(-1) were significantly higher than those of abalone fed the control diet for 14 days. After 21 days, the PO activity, respiratory bursts, SOD activity, and phagocytic activity and clearance efficiency of V. parahaemolyticus by abalone fed the sodium alginate-containing diet at 1.0 g kg(-1) were significantly higher than those of abalone fed the other diets. It was concluded that sodium alginate can be used as an immunostimulant for abalone through dietary administration to enhance immune responses of abalone and resistance against V. parahaemolyticus, which were related to the dose and timing of administration.

"Dlaza, TS; Maneveldt, GW; Viljoen, C",Growth of post-weaning abalone Haliotis midae fed commercially available formulated feeds supplemented with fresh wild seaweed,2008,AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE,30,1,199,203,,"The effect of five formulated feeds supplemented with fresh wild seaweed on the growth of post-weaning juvenile abalone Haliotis midae (6-20 mm shell length) was investigated by means of a growth trial at a commercial abalone farm over a period of 11 months. The experiment included 10 diet treatments with two replicates each (n = 50 individuals per replicate). The first five diet treatments comprised four fishmeal-based formulated feeds: Abfeed (R), Adam & Amose (R) 'a', Adam & Amos (R) 'b' and Adam & Amos (R) 'c'; and an all-seaweed -based formulated pellet, FeedX. The additional five diet treatments comprised the formulated feeds above, supplemented with fresh wild seaweeds: the kelp Ecklonia maxima (5-15% protein) and Ulva lactuca (3.7-19.9% protein). The fishmeal-based protein feeds produced significantly better growth than the all-seaweed-based protein feed (FeedX: 0.49 +/- 0.03 specific growth rate [SGR]; 27.15 +/- 0.02 daily increment increase in shell length [DISL]; 0.864 final condition factor [CF]). Abfeed (R) (1.00 +/- 0.02 SGR; 60.79 +/- 0.04 DISL; 1.312 final CF) performed best of all the formulated feeds. Supplementation with fresh, wild seaweed, however, significantly improved growth of all abalone with supplemented Abfeed (R) (1.05 +/- 0.02 SGR; 63.61 +/- 0.05 DISL; 1.447 final CF), outperforming all supplemented feeds. A noteworthy observation was that the condition factor of abalone fed the feed that performed particularly poorly in the growth trials (FeedX) was dramatically improved by supplementation. It was shown that supplementation with fresh wild seaweed enhances the growth of abalone reared on formulated feeds.",10.2989/AJMS.2008.30.1.22.472

Six semi-purified diets containing graded levels of dietary copper (1.08, 3.76, 6.54, 14.80, 26.84 and 109.41 mg/kg diet) from CuSO4 center dot 5H(2)O were fed to juvenile abalone (initial shell length: 17.21 +/- 0.04 mm; initial body weight: 0.65 +/- 0.00 g) in triplicate groups for 24 weeks in a flow-through system. The results showed that no significant (P>0.05) differences were found in weight gain rate (WGR, %), daily increment in shell length (DISL mu m/day) and survival among the dietary treatments. However, Cu concentrations in abalone serum, hepatopancreas, muscle and newly grown shell showed a clear increasing trend with the supplementation of dietary Cu, and the concentrations were significantly (P<0.05) higher in abalone fed dietary Cu >= 26.84 mg/kg compared to those fed 1.08 mg Cu/kg. The crude lipid in abalone carcass decreased with increasing dietary Cu and was significantly (P<0.05) lower in abalone fed dietary Cu 26.84 mg/kg compared to the rest of the treatments. The activities of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn SOD) in the hepatopancreas and serum were significantly increased when supplementation of dietary Cu reached 3.76 mg/kg diet, and 6.54 mg/kg diet provided maximum activity of serum phenoloxidase (PO). There was no significant difference for these enzyme activities when dietary Cu was over those values. The optimum requirement of juvenile abalone for dietary Cu was estimated to be 3-5 mg/kg diet by broken-line regression analysis, based on the activities of CuZn SOD and PO either in abalone hepatopancreas or serum. Deficiency of dietary Cu significantly depressed the immune responses in abalone. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2009.09.006

Four artificial diets were designed with 0 (artificial diet control), 7.5, 15.0 and 22.5 mg/kg of APSH-07, respectively. The brown algaLaminaria japonicawas used as the live food control. Results showed that the specific growth rates of abalone in the groups with 7.5 and 15.0 mg/kg dietary APSH-07 were significantly higher than those in the controls (p < .05). The total haemocyte counts and respiratory burst activity in haemolymph of abalone in the group with 7.5 mg/kg of dietary APSH-07 were significantly higher than those in the groups with 0 and 22.5 mg/kg of dietary APSH-07 (p < .05). The gene expression levels of Mn-superoxide dismutase and thioredoxin peroxidase 2, and the activities of glutathione peroxidase in the group with 7.5 mg/kg of dietary APSH-07 were significantly higher than those in the other groups (p < .05). Cumulative mortality of abalone after the challenge test was significantly decreased in the group with 7.5 mg/kg of dietary APSH-07 supplementation. Supplementation of 22.5 mg/kg dietary APSH-07 significantly increased the cumulative mortality. In conclusion, 7.5 mg/kg of dietary APSH-07 supplementation had the better growth performance, higher antioxidation, immune and disease resistance capacity of abalone. Excessive supplementation of dietary antimicrobial peptide APSH-07 (22.5 mg/kg) had significantly negative effects. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal level of dietary APSH-07 supplementation for abalone.",10.1111/anu.13124

We tested 13 different types of feed, each with varying amounts of three carotenoids: astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and beta-carotene. These feeds were given to two types of abalones: those with common (pale yellow) and orange-colored foot muscles. The study found that all abalones, regardless of the carotenoid levels in their diet, had a survival rate of about 70-80%. This suggests that these added nutrients do not significantly change their survival chances. Interestingly, when exposed to heat, the common-footed abalones were able to stay attached longer than the orange-footed ones, indicating that they might benefit more from the added nutrients. In addition, both types showed similar resistance to bacterial infection. Our findings highlight the potential of using carotenoid-enriched diets in aquaculture to improve the health and resilience of abalones, offering insights for developing better feeds for these valuable sea creatures. Carotenoids, known to enhance survival, heat tolerance, and bacterial resistance, play an essential role in the nutrition of economically important aquatic animals. This study specifically examined their impact as feed additives on the abalone Haliotis gigantea. We prepared 13 compound feeds with varying levels of astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and beta-carotene, and administered them to both common-footed and orange-footed H. gigantea. The survival rate of H. gigantea was about 70-80%, with no significant differences in survival observed among the various carotenoid-supplemented feeding groups or when compared with the control group, nor between orange-footed and common-footed individuals. In heat attachment duration experiments, orange-foot abalones exhibited longer attachment durations with certain concentrations of astaxanthin and zeaxanthin, whereas common-foot abalones showed extended durations with astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and beta-carotene, indicating that common-foot abalones might benefit more from these carotenoids. Additionally, our results showed similar patterns and levels of Vibrio harveyi AP37 resistance in both orange-footed and common-footed H. gigantea, suggesting a uniform response to carotenoid supplementation in their bacterial defense mechanisms. This study suggests the potential benefits of carotenoid supplementation in H. gigantea and contributes to the theoretical basis for developing high-quality artificial compound feeds.",10.3390/ani14020180
"Dai, QH; Cho, SH","Dietary inclusion effect of citrus peel by-product as an additive on the growth performance, body composition, and various stress resistance of juvenile abalone (Haliotis discus) compared to ethoxyquin",2022,AQUACULTURE REPORTS,24,,,,101187,"Dietary additive can effectively improve growth performance and stressor resistance of aquatic animals. Dietary inclusion effect of citrus peel by-product (CPB) as an additive on the growth, body composition, and various stress resistance of juvenile abalone (Haliotis discus) was investigated, and compared to commercial antioxidant (ethoxyquin). A total of 2880 juvenile (initial weight of 3.3 g) abalone were randomly assigned into 24 net cages. Seven formulated diets supplemented with 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50 g/kg CPB and 0.01 g/kg ethoxyquin were formulated, and referred to as the CPB0, CPB5, CPB10, CPB20, CPB30, CPB50, and EQ diets, respectively. Finally, dry Saccharina japonica was prepared to compare the formulated diets on growth of abalone. All experimental diets were assigned to triplicate groups of abalone. Abalone were daily fed to satiation for 16 weeks. After the 16-week feeding trial, sixty abalone from each cage were subjected to the 20-h air, 12-h low salinity at 25 psu, and 20-h high temperature at 30 degrees C exposure stressors, respectively, and then survival was monitored. Abalone fed all formulated diets produced superior weight gain, specific growth rate (SGR), shell growth to abalone fed the S. japonica. Dietary inclusion levels of CPB linearly improved weight gain of abalone. However, there was no difference in chemical composition of the soft body of abalone fed all experimental diets. Diets supplemented with CPB or EQ improved survival of abalone when subjected to the 20-h air and high temperature exposures. In conclusion, CPB was a very effective additive as growth enhancer as well as stress reducer in abalone diet. Abalone fed the CPB50 diet attained the highest weight gain, SGR, and stress resistance subjected to the 20-h air and high temperature exposures.",10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.101187

H. discus hannai (shell length: 32.75 +/- 2.63 mm, body weight: 4.91 +/- 0.34 g) was selected to perform a 70 d laboratory culture experiment including a 14 d V. parahaemolyticus artificial infection experiment. The control group (C) was fed normal commercial feed every day. The M1 experimental group was given experimental feed and basal feed on alternating days until the end of the experiment. The M2 experimental group was given experimental feed for 4 d and basal feed for 3 d, and this cycle was repeated every 7 d until the end of the experiment. The M3 experimental group was given experimental feed for 2 d and basal feed for 5 d, and this cycle was repeated every 7 d until the end of the experiment. The M4 group was continuously given experimental feed for the duration of the experiment. The concentration of added B. lincheniformis in each experimental group was 10(5) cfu/g (according to the quantity of viable bacteria). The specific growth rate (as measured by body weight) and the feed conversion efficiency of the abalone in M1 and M2 were significantly higher than those in M4 and C (P < 0.05). The cellulose and lipase activities of abalone in M1, M2 or M4 were significantly higher than those in M3 or C (P < 0.05). The acid phosphatase, superoxide dismutase, total haemocyte counts, 02- levels generated by respiratory bursts, and the expression levels of Mn-SOD, TPx, GST(s), and GST(m), in abalone in the M2 group were significantly higher than those in any other feeding frequency group (P < 0.05). At the end of the V. parahaemolyticus infection, the cumulative mortality of the abalone in M2 was significantly lower than that in any other group (P < 0.05). Consequently, given the growth advantages and the enhancement of immune function, the feeding plan in which B. lincheniformis was applied for 4 d per week, and basal feed was then applied for 3 d, did not lead to a high level of immune reaction, immune fatigue or waste of resources, but increased the growth rate of individuals and their resistance to V. parahaemolyticus infection.",10.1016/j.fsi.2019.11.038

Here we investigated the feeding behaviour of juvenile greenlip abalone, Haliotis laevigata; fed live macroalgae and formulated diets at different rations; and observed their feeding behaviour using a novel ventral video monitoring technique. Four different diets (commercial chip, experimental flake, Ulva sp. and Gracilaria cliftonii) at two feeding rations (excess vs. restricted) were tested. Diet type had no effect on abalone movement, but macroalgal diets resulted in higher feed intakes. Restricting feed rations induced greater movement. Abalone moved little during the light period and moved mostly during darkness, except for animals on the restricted feed ration where feeding commenced during the light period. On farms, this phenomenon may be a useful behavioural indicator for identifying underfed abalone. Despite their lower intake, formulated diets promoted higher energy and nutritional intake, indicating that quantity of feed consumed is not solely indicative of nutritional gain. From a research perspective, the novel ventral monitoring method has created opportunities for further behavioural studies in molluscs.",10.1080/10236244.2014.990701
"Somerville, GJ; Krkosek, M; Hepburn, CD",A matrix model and elasticity analysis for New Zealand's blackfoot paua Haliotis iris,2014,FISHERIES RESEARCH,151,,158,168,,"Whether used for conservation or fisheries planning, matrix population models can help clarify how to allocate conservation effort across a species life history. In this research we develop and analyse a matrix population model for the New Zealand blackfoot paua (abalone) Haliotis iris. Preliminary calculations for one population of H. iris yielded a population growth rate (PGR) of 16%. However due to uncertain parameter values we trialled larval settlement rates that resulted in population growth rates (PGRs) from 0 to 17%. The results showed that specific knowledge about settlement rate and juvenile survival was unimportant for the relative influence of these life-history parameters on this deterministic matrix model. Survival of the larger adults consistently had the highest sensitivity and elasticity, however in a rapidly growing population survival of the smaller animals gained importance. Also, the somewhat arbitrary placement of the shell length division between the two classes of adults created changes, with larger classes having higher elasticities. In addition elasticity, (indicating effect on the population growth rate) was concentrated in the older adults. However sensitivity, (with its greater emphasis on evolutionary change) placed more emphasis on slightly younger adults. These findings suggest that survival of larger adult paua, which is the stage typically targeted for harvest, is a key factor in fishery productivity, restoration, and conservation of the species.

The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of the commercial animal feed product Orego-Stim (OS), containing oregano essential oil in reducing the mortality of 3-y-old greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) exposed to high water temperature (25 degrees C). Inclusion levels of 0.0 (commercial control diet), 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, and 4.0% OS were added into a commercial feed formulation and diets were fed to 3-y-old greenlip abalone (67.98 g, 77.01 mm shell length) at two water temperatures (22 degrees C and 25 degrees C) for 47 days. Survival and immune parameters including phagocytic activity, total hemocyte count (THC), and activities of the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were measured. Survival was high at 22 degrees C with no significant differences in mortality between treatments. Irrespective of this, exposure to elevated water temperature (25 degrees C) resulted in significantly higher mortalities for all diet treatments (P < 0.05), without any effect of diet. Low ferric reducing antioxidant potential values were observed for all diets. Phagocytic activity remained stable for all temperature and OS treatments (48.82% +/- 1.31%). The dietary inclusion of OS and increased water temperature increased the THC compared with the commercial control diet treatment at 22 degrees C. Superoxide dismutase was significantly elevated in greenlip abalone fed the commercial control (0.56 +/- 0.08 U mL(-1)), and CAT was significantly higher when fed the 4.0% OS diet treatment at 25 degrees C (18.93 +/- 2.25 nmol min(-1) mL(-1)). Despite failing to increase survival, OS significantly enhanced feed intake at both temperatures at 2.0% and 4.0% compared with the commercial control diet treatment, highlighting its ability as a feeding stimulant (P < 0.05).",10.2983/035.036.0326

With the industry facing pressure to adopt environmentally friendly practices, E. maxima offers promise due to its bioactive compounds that promote growth and health in aquatic organisms. Studies have shown that dietary supplementation with E. maxima improves fish growth rates, feed conversion efficiency, and nutrient retention. The seaweed's bioactive compounds, including phlorotannins and fucoidans, enhance digestibility, modulate gut health, and stimulate immune responses. This review assesses the impact of E. maxima supplementation on fish growth performance and feed utilization, considering factors like dietary inclusion levels and species-specific responses. Findings suggest that E. maxima supplementation positively influences growth parameters and feed efficiency in various fish species, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional feed additives. However, further research is needed to optimize supplementation protocols and elucidate underlying mechanisms. Leveraging marine resources can help the industry adopt more environmentally responsible practices while ensuring continued growth and prosperity. Overall, this review emphasizes the significance of E. maxima as a sustainable feed supplement in aquaculture, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where the region's particular environmental challenges must be addressed while production is increased due to the growing demand for fish farming.

Ln two growth trials the effect of temperature and abalone size on growth rate and nutritional indices of abalone fed a dry formulated diet was quantified. Between 12 and 20 degrees C growth rate and feed consumption increased, protein-efficiency ratio (PER) improved and FCR did not differ significantly. However, between 20 and 24 degrees C, growth and feed consumption declined sharply, and PER and FCR deteriorated. The condition factor of abalone decreased with increasing temperature. It was concluded that temperatures between 12 and 20 degrees C are physiologically optimal for H. midae. This range corresponds to the mean sea temperature range experienced by H. midae within its natural range, Feed consumption, expressed as a percentage of body weight per day, decreased with increasing abalone size.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of Spirulina powder-supplemented feeds on abalone growth after 93 days and 125 days of culture. Spirulina particles were attached to the surfaces of abalone feed granules by mixing to prepare Spirulina powder-supplemented abalone feeds. The morphology, components, and thermal stability of the granules were analyzed. Abalone body weight and shell characteristics (size, pigmentation, morphology, and components) were also assessed for evaluating abalone growth. Protein expression patterns in abalones were monitored. Spirulina particles were detected on the surfaces of Spirulina powder-supplemented abalone feed granules, which were not modified in size and shape after attachment. The Spirulina powder-supplemented feed granules included organic materials and minerals based on C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, and Ca. They were thermally stable up to 20 degrees C. Abalones fed Spirulina powder-supplement at 0.7 % showed significantly increased body weight and shell size after 125-day culture. Shell pigmentation and morphology were also improved. The shell contained C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, and Fe. Abalone proteins were clearly expressed at 75-100 kD and 150-250 kD.

The algae Macrocystis pyrifera, Gracilaria chilensis, and Sarcothalia crispata were administered as mixed diets, mono diets, or in rotation changing weekly. Additionally, an artificial pellet feed (ABfeed) was administered alone using a feeder or as part of a mixed diet. The experiment lasted 10 mo. The 100% S. crispata diet was suspended after 4 mo due to low survival rates (92.1% +/- 3.4%). Treatments had significant effects (P <0.05) on survival, growth, food consumption, and conversion factor. The lowest survival rate was obtained using the artificial feed with a feeder (94.2% +/- 4.3%) and the highest with a mix of.11. pyrifera and artificial feed (99.0% +/- 0.8%). The highest growth rates were obtained with the mix of M. pyrifera, G. chilensis, and artificial feed (0.044 +/- 0.007 mm/day per 0.054 +/- 0.005 g/day) and with 100% M. pyrifera (0.043 +/- 0.002 mm/day per 0.054 +/- 0.01 g/day). The lowest growth rates were obtained with 100% G. chilensis (0.026 +/- 0.01 mm/day per 0.021 0.01 g/day). Food conversion factor was highest with the mixed Al. pyqiera (16.0) and G. chilensis (12.7) diet, whereas the lowest food conversions rates were obtained using artificial feed with a feeder (1.4) and artificial feed without a feeder (1.6). In this study, the M. pyrifera mono diet produced the highest growth rates in H. rufescens juveniles. Given that it is also the most abundant alga in terms of biomass and is easily managed during the feeding process, this would appear to be the best option for the culturing red abalone in southern Chile.",10.2983/035.035.0420

Understanding the nocturnal feeding patterns of abalone is fundamental to feed management and productive abalone farming. In this study, the apparent feed consumption for greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) and hybrid abalone (H. laevigata x Haliotis rubra) fed fresh Ulva sp. or a commercial formulated diet at 18 degrees C or 22 degrees C were investigated at night. Abalone were exposed to low light intensity (3.4 Lux) from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM and darkness from 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM. Abalone were fed to excess daily at 4:00 PM and feed intake was determined at 7:00 PM, 10:00 PM, 1:00 AM, 4:00 AM, and 8:00 AM. When Ulva sp. was added to the tank, greenlip and hybrid abalone immediately displayed a feeding response, which was not observed in abalone fed the formulated diet. Abalone consumed Ulva sp. at a linear rate from 4:00 PM to 8:00 AM. In contrast, the apparent feed consumption rate of abalone fed the formulated diet was minimal from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM, and was highest between 7:00 PM and 1:00 AM. Apparent feed consumption rate of abalone significantly increased as water temperature increased from 18 degrees C to 22 degrees C, but the effect was greater for hybrid abalone compared with greenlip abalone. The total apparent feed intake of both greenlip and hybrid abalone fed Ulva sp. was significantly greater than for both types of abalone fed the formulated diet. The total apparent feed intake on dry basis, and nutrient intake for abalone fed Ulva sp. was significantly lower than for abalone fed the formulated diet. This study indicates that the upper temperature range for feed intake in hybrid abalone is higher than in greenlip abalone. Ulva sp. can stimulate abalone feeding, though the high moisture content in algae can reduce nutrient intake.",10.2983/035.034.0318

This study aims to investigate the effect of an encapsulated probiotics feed on the growth and health of New Zealand black-footed abalone (Haliotis iris). Juvenile abalone were fed with four different dietary treatments, including commercial pellets, commercial feed sprayed with probiotics, combination of commercial feed and chitosan-coated alginate (CCALG) beads containing probiotics and CCALG beads containing both probiotics and nutrients. A multi-technique approach was used to evaluate the growth performance and health parameters of the experimental animals after 57 days in feeding trial. The results showed a significantly higher growth rate (p < 0.05) in shell length (50.06 +/- 5.91 mu m/day) and weight (25.55 +/- 2.55 mg/day) of abalone fed with CCALG beads containing both probiotics and nutrients (optimal diet) compared to the other groups. The feed conversion rate (FCR) for abalone fed with the optimal diet (1.04 +/- 0.06) was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than the other experimental diets. Furthermore, a low level of haemocytes with reactive oxygen species (ROS) was found associated with the optimal diet (13.24 +/- 4.2%). A total of 31 differently regulated metabolites across the four treatments were revealed with a characteristic enhancement of free amino acids in the samples obtained from abalone fed with the optimal diet. The combined results from the growth parameters, flowcytometry and metabolomics indicate that CCALG beads encapsulating probiotics and nutrients can efficiently improve the growth and immunity of juvenile abalone.",10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2023.115639

Concerns over the long-term supply of macroalgae have led farmers to investigate the suitability of various formulated feeds, however there has been limited commercial adoption. Combination diets of macroalgal and formulated feed fed together provide a mechanism to explore and adapt to formulated feed use without entirely abandoning macroalgal feed. The current study evaluated the use of formulated, macroalgal and two combination diets (low and high macroalgal supplementation) on production indicators and canning yields of juvenile abalone H. rufescens in a culture system modified for formulated feed. The macroalgal diet and the high macroalgal-formulated pellet combination diet (76.1% macroalgae: 23.9% pelleted diet as dry weight) produced significantly higher growth indicators (SGR and LGR) than the low macroalgal-formulated pellet combination diet (31.6% macroalgae: 68.4% pelleted diet as dry weight) and the formulated pellet diet. The protein efficiency ratio of the experimental treatments was positively related to the proportional contribution of fresh macroalgae in the diet. Furthermore, calculation of the protein efficiency ratio of the formulated component in combination diets (PERf) revealed a significant positive relationship between macroalgae contribution and PERf. This suggests that the increase in total PER is driven by the increased utilisation of protein in the formulated component of combination diets associated with increasing levels of fresh macroalgal supplementation. We suggest possible reasons why the presence of seaweed increased the availability of the formulated feed protein to the abalone. A simulated canning trial highlighted a significant positive linear relationship between meat canning yield and the proportional contribution of formulated feed. This study highlights the value of combination diets as a tool for abalone producers to harness the potential production advantages of macroalgae while still accessing the processing benefits associated with nutrient dense formulated feed. Statement of relevance: We believe that this manuscript describes novel insights into the efficiency of protein utilisation in juvenile red abalone fed combination diets as well as the effect of diet, particularly formulated feed inclusion level, on canned meat yields. This provides empirical information to inform commercial abalone farmers of H. rufescens when exploring dietary options for optimal culture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Four macroalgae, Egregia menziesii, Eisenia arborea, Macrocystis pyrifera, Gracilaria sp., and the surfgrass Phyllospadix torreyi were used as feeds. Response patterns of abalone were very similar at both facilities in terms of final length, weight, and survival, varying from 13.0 to 15.50 mm, 0.31 to 0.52 g, and 60.0% to 78.6%, respectively. Better growth was obtained when E. menziesii, M. pyrifera, and Gracilaria sp. were offered. Poor results were obtained with surfgrass.

Limitations on the availability and use of fish meal through EU directives (EC Regulation 999/2001 & EC Regulation 183/2005) are focussing research efforts to find alternative sources of protein for aquaculture feeds. Marine algae, although low in protein, are widely being considered as a potential alternative to fish meal as not only do they have the potential to impart additional health benefits when ingested but they can also be cultured under enrichment conditions to enhance their nutritional profile as a feed additive. For abalone (a marine gastropod mollusc), several studies have highlighted the benefits of a diet of fresh mixed species seaweed for cultivation. However, the performance of a mixed species marine algae meal, consisting of Laminaria digitata meal, Palmaria palmata meal and Ulva lactuca meal, in a formulated diet for abalone has not apparently been investigated. In this study, the performance of five novel, isonitrogenous, konjac glucomannan-xanthan gum (KX) bound feeds for the abalone Haliotis discus hannai were evaluated in a 12-week experimental growth trial. Comparisons were made between a basal diet formulation (Diet A), a basal diet + lipids + choline chloride (Diet B) and diets containing mixed seaweed meal (Diet C) or fish meal (Diet D) or mixed seaweed meal + fish meal (Diet E). Freshly harvested L. digitata was included as a natural feed type and experimental control. Dry matter leaching was assessed and no significant differences in the dry matter loss over 3 and 4 days were observed between the experimental KX feeds, although L. digitata was a significantly more sea water stable feed type. Daily food consumption (DFC) of Diet C and Diet E was significantly lower than that of fresh L. digitata and the DFC of Diet D was significantly higher than that of L. digitata. Diet E had significantly higher food conversion efficiency than L. digitata, Diet A, Diet B and Diet D. There was no difference in the protein efficiency ratio (PER) between the formulated diets but the PER of Diet D was significantly different to L. digitata. L. digitata had significantly higher linear growth rates than Diet B, and significant differences in the specific growth rates were observed between Diet A and Diet D only. No significant differences in body weight to shell length ratios and percentage survival between treatments were observed. This study highlights the potential for a mixed species seaweed meal as a fish meal replacement in formulated feeds for abalone. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

Structure of the digestive gland was described, and proteoglycan granules were detected in the digestive cells. The abundance of granules was variable, depending on the feed provided to the abalone, and this was reflected in their growth. Granular content in digestive cells fed Ulva sp. was scarce, leading to low growth rate and high feed conversion ratio (FCR). Digestive cells of juveniles fed E. menziesii led to the best nutritional condition, including many proteoglycans cellular granules, best weight growth rate and a low FCR. Histochemical analysis of the digestive gland, differentiated by a modified Goldner trichrome method that included Alcian blue, was a useful tool for determining the nutritional status of farmed abalone, therefore recommended for assessing adjustments to the natural feed or formulation to meet the nutritional needs of abalone.",10.1111/anu.12295

This is the basis of least-cost linear computer programs. However, experiments conducted on pigs and rats have revealed that the inclusion of dietary fiber in manufactured feeds may result in a depression of the digestibility coefficients of the constituent ingredients. Thus, feeds that are formulated by adding the digestibility coefficients of each constituent ingredient, derived by the direct measurement of the digestibility of each ingredient when incorporated into base diets, may lead to an overestimation of the digestibility of nutrients in the manufactured feed. A series of isonitrogenous diets containing semolina, fishmeal, barley, lupin kernel meal, and various combinations of these ingredients were fed to juvenile greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) to determine the apparent fecal digestibilities of N, amino acids, and gross energy. The digestibility coefficients of the single-ingredient diets were used to predict the digestibility of N, amino acids, and gross energy in casein in the mixed diets. The calculated digestibility values for casein did not differ significantly between diets. Thus, the apparent fecal digestibilities of N, amino acids, and gross energy of the constituent ingredients were not affected by varying ingredient combinations in the diets. Apparent fecal digestibility values for the chosen ingredients are additive when they are incorporated into compound feeds for abalone and so are good descriptors of nutritive value and can be used with confidence in diet formulations.",

In the present study, postprandial metabolic responses of abalone Haliotis discus hannai fed with different levels of dietary methionine (0.46%, 1.19% and 2.07%, respectively) for 84 days were investigated. Compared with the group with 0.46% of dietary methionine, 2.07% of dietary methionine significantly increased the concentration of glucose in CFH at 0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 60 h and 84 h, while the concentrations of ammonia were significantly decreased by 2.07% of dietary methionine at each time point after feeding (P < 0.05). The 1.19% of dietary methionine significantly increased the activity of trypsin at 0 h, 24 h 60 h and 84 h after feeding (P < 0.05). The phosphorylation levels of protein kinase B (AKT), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and ribosomal s6 protein (S6) peaked at 12 h and then dropped to base level at 36-84 h. Compared with the group with 0.46% of dietary methionine, 1.19% of dietary methionine significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of AKT at 12 h and 24 h, and extended the phosphorylation time of AKT (P < 0.05). And the phosphorylation level of mTOR was significantly increased by 1.19% of dietary methionine at 12 h, 24 h and 36 h after feeding (P < 0.05).

The expressions of genes related of insulin signaling pathway (phosphoinositide 3-kinase and protein kinase B), glycolysis (hexokinase) and transport of lipid (fatty acid transport protein) were significantly increased by 1.19% of dietary methionine, while the key gene of gluconeogenesis (glucose-6-phosphatase) were decreased. In summary, 1.19% of dietary methionine could enhance digestive and absorptive capacity, protein synthesis, glucose metabolism and fatty acid transportation of abalone. Take long-term feeding trial with dietary methionine as an example and combine the results of data analysis, it is suggested to analyze the protein level of mTOR signaling pathway within 36 h after feeding, assess the biochemical parameters in CFH and the mRNA levels of nutrient metabolism related genes within 36-84 h, and detect the activities of digestive and absorptive enzymes within 60-84 h.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.741473

Abalone in cages fed a diet produced by Coast Biologicals grew significantly faster than abalone in cages fed Makara. The difference in growth produced by the two diets may be related to improved food availability in cages throughout the feeding period. Mortality was high in all structures (66% of the entire experimental population) and did not differ significantly among structure and diet treatments, Mortalities were thought to be caused by a combination of shell infestations (by burrowing worms) and silty water conditions within the grow-out structures. The commercial food conversion ratio was used to compare the performance of diets within structures. Mean values ranged from 13.9 +/- 5.6 for paua grown in barrels and fed Makara to 2.9 +/- 0.0003 for abalone grown in tubes and fed Makara.

Above 7% lipid, specific growth rate, shell length increment and protein efficiency ratio decreased while feed consumption and FCR increased significantly. The observed deterioration in growth and nutritional performance in diets with > 7% dietary lipid was more marked in the 65-70 mm size class than in the 25-30 mm class, indicating that the smaller size class were better equipped to metabolize higher levels of dietary lipid. We concluded that the observed decrease in growth and feed utlization with the increasing dietary lipid was not due to an imbalance of dietary protein relative to energy, but rather that H. midae is unable to effectively utilize lipids as an energy source at levels in excess of 7% due to inherent physiological constraints.",10.1111/j.1365-2109.2010.02742.x

This study aims to (i) investigate the effect of nutrient enrichment (non-enriched and enriched) and fresh macroalgae type (Ulva sp., Gracilaria cliftonii, and an equal combination of Ulva sp. and G. cliftonii) on the growth and feed utilisation of greenlip abalone and (ii) compare the performance of abalone fed fresh macroalgae to those separately fed either one of the three commercial formulated diets. Abalone were fed to excess at 16:00 h daily, and uneaten feed was collected the following morning. Nutrient enrichment increased the protein level for Ulva sp. and G. cliftonii from 5.3 to 27.7% and 12.9 to 38.1%, respectively. The growth of abalone fed G. cliftonii was superior to animals fed Ulva sp. The effect of enrichment was macroalgae species-dependent. While abalone fed enriched Ulva sp. exhibited superior growth to those fed non-enriched Ulva sp., animals fed non-enriched and enriched G. cliftonii exhibited similar growth. However, abalone fed non-enriched G. cliftonii had superior apparent protein deposition and protein efficiency ratio, compared to animals fed enriched G. cliftonii. Feeding an equal mix of Ulva sp. and G. cliftonii had a positive synergistic effect on abalone growth, compared to animals fed mono-specific algae. Abalone fed each commercial diet exhibited improved growth and feed utilisation compared to animals fed fresh macroalgae. The results of the current study suggest that the use of fresh G. cliftonii as a source of carbohydrates may spare protein when feeding formulated diets to abalone. When formulated diets are unavailable or are inappropriate to feed abalone, a mix of enriched Ulva sp. and G. cliftonii may be used. However, feeding fresh macroalgae alone to cultured greenlip abalone should be avoided, if growth is the parameter of interest and we recommend that commercial formulated diets be fed to cultured greenlip abalone.

In this 90-day study, growth and feed utilisation of juvenile (1.82 g) greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) fed diets containing graded dietary inclusion levels of Acti-Meal (0 basal, 5, 10, 15 and 20%) were examined. Four replicates were allocated per treatment with 15 abalone per tank and abalone were fed to excess daily. All experimental diets were formulated to contain 35% crude protein, 5% crude lipid and 17.5 MJ kg(-1) gross energy. In addition, a commercial diet was also fed to abalone and compared with the 0% diet. Growth and feed utilisation of greenlip abalone fed the commercial diet and the 0% basal diet were similar. Greenlip abalone fed any Acti-Meal inclusion level (5, 10, 15 and 20%) exhibited significantly superior growth to abalone fed the 0% basal diet. Notably, in comparison to the basal diet, specific growth rate and biomass gain were improved by 5 to 6% and 10 to 12% respectively. The improvements were achieved despite greenlip abalone consuming significantly less feed (similar to 9%) when fed the Acti-Meal diets. Greenlip abalone fed diets with Acti-Meal also exhibited superior apparent feed conversion ratios compared to those fed the 0% basal diet, on average FCRs were reduced by 13%. We recommend dietary inclusions of up to 20% Acti-Meal to improve greenlip abalone growth. We also recommend an on-farm growth trial to validate this product.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.08.074

A total of 400 tenmonth-old Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) were randomly sampled. To evaluate feed efficiency traits, each abalone was cultured for 72 days using the previously established single-individual system. After that, the FER was ranked after removing outliers, the top and bottom 150 individuals were exposed to different durations of fasting stress (3, 7, 10, 14, and 21 days), which was followed by single-individual re-feeding treatments. The fluctuations in body weight of each abalone during this process were recorded. The difference in the ability to cope with fasting stress and re-feed between the high- and low-FER (feed efficiency ratio) groups was analyzed. The findings demonstrated that the specific weight loss rate (SWLR) of the high- and low-FER groups of Pacific abalone differed after varying durations of fasting. The results of the correlation analysis between FER and weight change index showed that SWLR was negatively correlated with FER during stress, and the correlation of the 7-day fasting group (S7) was the highest (r = -0.71). The rapid growth stage during re-feeding was positively correlated with FER, and the correlation between the body weight gain (BWG) of days 14-28 and FER in the 10-day fasting group (S10) was the highest (r = 0.79). The results indicate that there is significant variation in the capacity of abalone to resist fasting stress and re-feeding, and this is associated with feed efficiency. The above measured indicators (SWLR of the S7 group and BWG14-28 of the S10 group) may be used as indirect indicators for feed efficiency traits, and these indicators have application value in abalone breeding.",10.1016/j.aqrep.2025.102793

While there is a dearth of comprehensive investigation into the effects of these feeding patterns on the temporal dynamics of enzyme activity, and intestinal microbiome of abalone. In this study, a total of 3600 juvenile Pacific abalones were allocated to 12 tanks, randomly divided into four groups based on the feeding patterns: fresh kelp (labeled as FK), salted kelp (SK), formulated feed (FF), and starved group (S). After a 60-day feeding trial, the results showed that abalone in the FK, SK, and FF groups exhibited significant positive effects on both weight and shell growth compared to the S group (P<0.05). Notably, the FF group displayed the highest values of the growth performance. The activity of digestive enzymes and antioxidant enzymes in the FF group had an up-regulated trend over the course of feeding trial, whereas amylase and lipase activity in abalone declined along with starvation. Moreover, the microbial Shannon index showed an overall decreasing trend over time in the FF, FK, and SK groups except for the S group. The ANOSIM analysis revealed that both feeding pattern and cultivating time significantly influenced the structure of the microbial communities. Across the feeding trial, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteriota, and Firmicutes were identified as the dominant phyla in the intestinal microbiome of abalone under different feeding patterns. The core genera were Psychrilyobacter, Mycoplasma, and Vibrio. Additionally, the neutral model analysis revealed that stochastic processes both play a key role in shaping the assembly of microbial communities in different feeding patterns. This study could offer valuable insights into the impact of different feeding patterns on growth and physiology of abalone, thereby contributing to the enhancement of management strategies in the northern Chinese abalone aquaculture industry.",10.1016/j.aqrep.2024.102427
"Kawamura, T; Roberts, RD; Takami, H",A review of the feeding and growth of postlarval abalone,1998,JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH,17,3,615,625,,"Survival and growth of abalone postlarvae are greatly influenced by food quality and quantity. Abalone larvae settle on coralline algae, some diatoms films, and conspecific mucous trails. These substrata provide a wide range of potential food sources, which are used in different ways as postlarvae develop. We identify three major transitions in feeding and growth: (1) at metamorphosis, a shift from lecithotrophy/dissolved organic matter (DOM) absorption to particle feeding, with an overlap in nutrition sources; (2) at about 600-800 mu m shelf length (SL), postlarvae become responsive to the digestibility'' of diatom diets and grow more rapidly on efficiently digested strains; (3) at around 5-10 mm SL juveniles shift from a biofilm-dominated diet to a macroalgae-dominated diet. We can make some tentative generalizations about growth rates of postlarvae fed ingestible diatoms. Rapid growth (20-30 mu m/day) in the first 10 days postsettlement often falls to 10-20 mu m/day in the following 1-2 wk, perhaps reflecting the exhaustion of nutrition from yolk/DOM. Postlarvae of 0.8-2 mm SL grow similar to 40-60 mu m/day on digestible diatoms and 15-30 mu m/day on indigestible ones. Rapidly growing juveniles over 3 mm SL will grow at 100 mu m/day or more, whereas poor diets can halve these growth rates. Growth rates of individual abalone will vary widely on both good and poor diets. Diatoms that are emerging as key species for abalone culture include Cylindrotheca closterium land needle-shaped Nitzschia spp.), Cocconeis spp., and Achnanthes spp., but caution is needed in extrapolating from the limited data avilable. Hatcheries need to maintain a suitable quantity of ingestible food as well as consider food quality. Many aspects of postlarval feeding and growth require further research.",

Diets were formulated to be isoenergetic (12.5 MJ kg(-1) digestible energy), containing a lipid level of similar to 3.6% and digestible protein from 17.99 to 28.57%. Abalone were fed to excess at 16:00 h daily, and uneaten feed was collected the following day. The specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone improved significantly as water temperatures increased from 14 to 17 to 20 degrees C. In addition, apparent protein deposition was significantly higher in abalone at 17 and 20 degrees C compared to abalone at 14 degrees C. There was no significant effect of dietary protein level on SGR, but faster growing abalone at 20 degrees C compensated by consuming more feed when fed low dietary protein levels. In contrast, a significant positive relationship was observed between dietary protein level and feed consumption rate in slower growing abalone at 14 and 17 degrees C. A nonsignificant tendency for the apparent feed conversion ratio (FCR) to improve was observed in abalone fed high protein diets at 20 degrees C, while at 14 degrees C, abalone had a significantly poorer FCR, especially when fed high dietary protein levels. Based on results from the current study, it is plausible to heat land-based nursery systems in order to gain accelerated growth of juveniles before transfer to grow-out systems. Additionally, no benefits were apparent by feeding abalone high protein diets at 14 or 17 degrees C, and we therefore recommend a dietary protein level of 29% CP at 14 and 17 degrees C. While the SGR of abalone at 20 degrees C was not significantly influenced by dietary protein, the feed consumption rate decreased and there was a tendency for FCR to improve as dietary protein level increased. Therefore, it may be beneficial for abalone to be switched to a diet containing similar to 35% CP at water temperatures >20 degrees C. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

During an 8-week culturing experiment in an indoor aquarium and a 2-week V. parahaemolyticus artificial infection experiment, the control group was fed with untreated food once a day, while the experimental groups (L1, L2 and L3) were fed with Lactobacillus pentosus added food. The concentration of probiotics in the experimental food was 10(3) cfu/g (L1), 10(5) cfu/g (L2) and 10(7) cfu/g (L3), respectively. The results showed that the survival rate, shell length-specific growth rate, and the food conversion rate (FCR) of abalones in Ll and L2 were significantly higher than the control group. The food intake of abalones in L3 was significantly lower than that in Ll, L2 and the control group, but there was no significant difference in FCR identified between Ll, L2 and L3. In the L pentosus-added groups, the total number of blood lymphocytes, lysozyme activity, acid phosphatase, superoxide dismutase, and expression levels of Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx) were significantly higher than the control group, while the malondialdehyde (MDA) content was significantly lower than the control group. The phagocytic activity of blood lymphocytes, catalase activity and the expression levels of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) of abalones in the control group were significantly lower than that in Ll and L2, but there was no significant difference when compared with L3.

Seven days after infection with V. parahaemolyticus, all abalones in the control group were dead. After 14 days the cumulative mortality rate of abalones in the L pentosus-added groups was significantly lower than that in the control group. Therefore, the 10(3) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g L. pentosus-added food not only promoted food intake and growth of abalones, but also improved their non-specific immunity and reduced V. parahaemolyticus infection, indicating that this strain is a good potential candidate for probiotic added food in the aquaculture industry.",10.1016/j.fsi.2018.04.010

The effects of dietary CUR on the survival and growth of the abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) were evaluated by measuring growth, hematological parameters, and the abundance and diversity of gut flora. A total of 720 abalones (shell length: 59.69 +/- 0.15 mm, body weight: 24.80 +/- 0.20 g) were randomly distributed into six group (six replicates each group), fed six diets containing 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 g/kg of CUR for 100 days. Results indicated that CUR supple-mentation at 0.1-0.4 g/kg diet improved the growth performance. When the addition of CUR was greater than 0.1 g/kg, the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and total antioxidant capacity in the serum and hepatopancreas were significantly increased, while the contents of malondialdehyde were significantly reduced (P < 0.05). After infection with Vibrio harveyi AP37, the survival rate in all CUR supple-mentation groups were significantly higher than the control group (P < 0.05), and the highest values of the total hemocyte count, reactive oxygen species, and phagocytic activity were recorded in CUR 0.1 group. In addition, supplementation of the diet with 0.1 g/kg CUR decreased the gut microbial diversity indices and increased the abundance of potentially beneficial genera including Mycoplasma (26.82%), Psychrilyobacter (23.62%) and Vibrio (21.44%). In conclusion, addition of 0.1 g/kg of CUR to the diet not only improved the survival, growth, feed utilization, and regulated gut flora composition of abalone, but also effectively enhanced their antioxidant ca-pacity, cellular immunity and resistance to V. harveyi AP37 infection.

Seaweeds were reared in a biofiltration unit with fishpond waste water effluents. The three algal species were found to contain high protein contents which would be related to its production under the high nitrogen culture conditions of the biofilter system. Protein and carbohydrate contents were highest in H. musciformis and lowest in G. cornea. Survival rates of juvenile abalone were very good, regardless of the algae fed. Feed intake of H. spinella was highest, followed by H. musciformis. Growth rates of abalone were within the range obtained under commercial conditions, final shell length and weight being significantly highest in animals fed H. spinella and lowest in those fed G. cornea. Feeding G. cornea lead to the lowest growth performance due to the lowest feed intake, whereas feed conversion ratios were significantly highest for H. musciformis and protein efficiency ratios were higher for both H. spinella and G. cornea. This study suggested the good potential of any of the three red seaweeds tested-successfully produced by the biofilter system, their nutritional composition being similar to other macroalgae used as feed for abalone and matching the abalone protein and lipid requirements-hence promoting growth and survival. Nevertheless, the biofilter produced macroalgae H. spinella showed the highest dietary value for juvenile of H. tuberculata coccinea. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

There was a significant effect of diet type and temperature on feeding behavior of abalone. Both types of abalone were more active and exhibited the highest velocity when fed the formulated diet at 22 degrees C. Greenlip abalone spent a larger proportion of time feeding on Ulva sp. than on the formulated diet, regardless of the water temperature. In contrast, no significant difference was observed in the proportion of time feeding between diet types for hybrid abalone. Both types of abalone rapidly located and consumed Ulva sp. when feed was introduced into the aquaria at 1600 h (light phase). In contrast, abalone predominantly commenced feeding on the formulated diet in the dark phase, indicating the potential of Ulva sp. as feed attractant in abalone diet, to promote feeding. The mode in which abalone consumed feed also differed between diets. Abalone fed the formulated diet nibbled intermittently on random chips, whereas when fed Ulva sp., abalone engulfed entire individual fronds before moving on to the next available frond. Greenlip and hybrid abalone exhibited homing behavior at the completion of the dark phase, which was more pronounced in abalone fed Ulva sp.

Overhigh dietary Cr level (2.72-3.33 mg/kg) decreased the flesh quality. Excessive dietary Cr level (3.33 mg/kg) had a negative effect on the health of abalone.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738291

Yet, such information is lacking for Australian hybrid abalone (Haliotis rubra x Haliotis laevigata), particularly with respect to life stage and water temperatures. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of dietary protein inclusion level on the growth performance, nutrient utilisation and nutritional quality of juvenile (33 g) Australian hybrid abalone reared at three different temperatures representative of winter (12 degrees C), average annual (17 degrees C) and summer (22 degrees C) grow-out periods and fed five diets containing graded dietary protein levels of 35, 38, 41, 44 and 47 %. Abalone growth increased with increasing water temperature with weight gains of approximately 100, 280 and 380 % of their initial weight at 12, 17 and 22 degrees C, respectively. Furthermore, the present study clearly demonstrated that higher dietary protein inclusion levels (41 %) than those currently used commercially (35 %) would significantly improve the growth performance when water temperatures are >= 17 degrees C without any adverse impacts on nutrient utilisation, nutrient deposition or nutritional quality of the abalone soft tissue. For example, at 22 degrees C abalone fed a diet containing 41 % protein obtained a significantly higher weight gain percentage (421 %) compared with those fed a diet containing 35 % protein (356 %). Lastly, it is suggested that maintaining a dietary protein inclusion level of 35 % or implementing a 'least cost' feeding approach during cooler seasons, or where water temperatures are similar to 12 degrees C, may be beneficial, considering only marginal growth improvements were observed during these periods of slow growth.",10.1017/S0007114523002519

Trials were done over 150-350 days and change in weight was measured at regular intervals. The 6 diets of single species tested were the red algae Jeannerettia lobata and Laurencia botryoides, the green alga Ulva australis, and the brown algae Macrocystis angustifolia, Phyllospora comosa and Ecklonia radiata. The greatest growth rate and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) for a single algal diet was with J. lobata (51.0 mg . day(-1), 4.0% wet weight). The highest intake was of P. comosa (4.1% body weight), but this did not result in a high growth rate (0.8 mg . day(-1)). Neither intake nor FCE were correlated with growth rate, suggesting that these measures are not good indicators of the nutritional value of a food item. The hierarchy of food preference of H. rubra was determined for the 6 test diets of single species based on chemosensory attractiveness, involving direct tactile and gustatory sampling. Abalone exhibited distinct preferences, the most preferred being J. lobata and the least preferred the phenolic-rich E. radiata. The hierarchy of chemosensory preference for the algae tested was related to the growth rate of abalone when feeding on these algae. Thus, preference appears to be under selective pressure to ensure that abalone select foods that are nutritionally valuable, resulting in optimum growth rates. However, the low-phenolic brown algae, M. angustifolia and P. comosa, were less preferred than L. botryoides, despite the negative growth and mortality of animals feeding on this alga.",10.1016/0044-8486(94)00347-Q

Two feeds were formulated: one without polyphenol reduction (EA01) and one with polyphenol reduction (EA02). Rehydrated E. arborea (ER03) was used as the control feed. The polyphenol content was quantified in EA01 and EA02, and the stability and hardness of all three feeds were measured at 24 h after immersion. Feed preference was evaluated through attraction and consumption tests on day 1, 6, and 12. The polyphenol concentration was reduced by 41% in EA02 (13.9 mg GAE g(-1)) compared to that of EA01 (33.3 mg GAE g(-1)). Both formulated feeds showed 88% stability and hardness values > 680 g cm(-2), which were greater than those of the control (ER03, 66% and 285 g cm(-2), respectively).

The non-specific humoral (phenoloxidase, lysozyme and agglutination titer) and cellular (phagocytic capacity and reactive oxygen species) responses were determined and compared with controls (no supplement) after 20, 40 and 60 days of feeding. Variation in the levels of responses was evident among different supplements. SP and APS significantly enhanced most of the immune parameters tested. Among the humoral responses, lysozyme activity significantly increased after feeding with SP-supplemented diet for 20, 40 or 60 days. Furthermore, lectin titer showed significant enhancement after 20 and 60 days of feeding with APS-supplemented diet. Significant increase in the production of reactive oxygen species was evident for all three supplements after 20 days of feeding, but no significant change in serum phenoloxidase activity was observed for any of the three supplements over the three different periods. Overall, significant modulation of the cellular responses was only noticed after 20 days of feeding with SP- or APS-supplemented diet. After 60 days, these two groups also exhibited a decrease in the cumulative symptom rates compared to the controls when challenged with Vibrio splendidus. These results indicated that dietary intake containing A. membranaceus root or its polysaccharides could enhance the immune responses of A. japonicus and improve its resistance to infection by V. splendidus.

Haliotis kamtschatkana populations are in decline, and current restoration efforts in Washington State rely on out-planting hatchery-produced juveniles. Hatchery personnel report highest mortalities in the postlarval stage of H. kamtschatkana, mainly during the first 3 to 6 months. Postlarvae feed on films of benthic diatoms, and the purpose of this study was to test six diatom species (Achnanthes brevipes, Amphora sauna, Amphiprora paludosa, Cylindrotheca closterium, Navicula incerta, and Nitzschia laevis) as suitable diets for H. kamtschatkana. Diatom diet suitability might rely on several factors, including diatom characteristics as well as the postlarva's ability to ingest the diatoms. The radula is a crucial feeding structure for gastropods and may display morphological plasticity, but this has never been characterized in H. kamtschatkana. We investigated survival, growth, and radula morphology of H. kamtschatkana postlarvae when fed one of six benthic diatom species for 61 days post-settlement. Amphora sauna yielded the highest survival, in a statistically homogenous subgroup with N. incerta, A. paludosa, and C. closterium. Achnanthes brevipes yielded exceptionally low survival, on par with a starvation control. Cylindrotheca closterium yielded significantly better growth than all other diets except A. sauna. Radula development was similar to that of other abalone species. The shape and size of the radula did not explain success or failure of any of the diatom diets since the radula morphology of H. kamtschatkana was comparable to other abalone that have succeeded when fed these same diets. We found no relationship between diatom diet and radula morphology. We recommend A. sauna as a suitable diet for newly settled H. kamtschatkana postlarvae, and that a combination of A. sauna and C. closterium be used to supplement feeding on naturally occurring biofilms.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.736136

This two-part experiment aimed to investigate first (i) the dose effect of replacing soy protein concentrate with SCP in Australian hybrid abalone diets (Haliotis laevigata Haliotis rubra) and second, (ii) the potential for improved palatability of the SCP by using commercially produced liquid protein hydrolysate (PH).

In the second experiment, there was a decline in measured protein and energy retention in the abalone fed 20% SCP, with a concomitantly lower apparent biological value. Positively, there were significant improvements in the apparent digestibility of the diet at the 20% SCP inclusion. There was no significant impact of using the PH on growth performance or feed intake. No effects were observed on the digestive enzyme activity (alpha-amylase, lipase, and trypsin) examined among the treatments. Considering these results collectively, the maximum recommended inclusion of methanotrophic SCP meal should be 10% for hybrid abalone. Reasons for the decline in performance at the highest inclusion may be related to palatability; however, this remains to be fully confirmed.",10.1155/anu/7291857

Subsequent investigations showed the higher energy density of the diets was achieved through the addition of fish oil. Given abalone's low requirement for lipids and the small amount of lipase in their gut, it was hypothesized that high levels of dietary lipid depresses the digestibility of other nutrients, such as amino acids, by restricting the action of digestive enzymes. A series of isonitrogenous diets containing 30, 60, or 90 g/kg of either jack mackerel oil or olive oil were formulated and fed to juvenile Haliotis laevigata to determine the apparent fecal digestibilities of dry matter, gross energy, nitrogen (N), and amino acids. inclusion of jack mackerel oil in manufactured abalone feeds at levels above 60 g/kg decreased the digestion of dietary N and amino acids, and inclusion at levels above 30 g/kg decreased gross energy digestion. Oil type also influenced the apparent fecal digestibility of N, amino acids, and gross energy. Olive oil inclusion had significantly different effects on the digestion of these parameters when compared with jack mackerel oil; however, these differences were minimal up to inclusion levels of 30 g/kg. It was concluded that the addition of marine or Vegetable oils to manufactured abalone diets should be limited to 30 g/kg if the digestibility of N, amino acids, and gross energy is not to be affected and that the addition of oils to increase dietary energy levels in abalone diets may not be a cost-effective strategy and may be detrimental to both energy and protein supply.",

We have shown that Haliotis midae fed a probiotic-supplemented diet have an improved survival and growth rate compared to animals not fed probiotics. The growth rate of small (20 mm) and large (67mm) abalone was improved by 8% and 34%, respectively, in two separate eight-month farm growth trials. Furthermore, the number, and pbagocytic activity, of circulating haemocytes was significantly higher (P<0.05) in probiotic treated animals compared to non-treated animals following challenge with the pathogenic bacterium Nbrio anguillarum. Seven days after challenging with V anguillarum, the probiotic-fed animals had 62% survival compared to 25% survival for non-treated animals. In situ protease assays showed that probiotic treatment significantly increased (P<0.05) protease activity in the intestinal region of the digestive tract of animals fed the probiotic-supplemented feed. This correlated with a significant increase (P<0.05) in the amount of protein digestion and absorption measured in this region of the abalone gut. Histological analysis showed that the digestive glands of animals receiving probiotics were bacteria-free, whereas the digestive glands of 70% of the animals receiving the non-supplemented feed had a high bacterial load. The microorganisms tested in this study therefore have tremendous potential as probiotics for commercially produced H. midae. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Abalone were fed daily for 7 days a week for 16 weeks. Following the completion of the feeding trial, 20 abalone from each cage were exposed to air for 20 h prior to being monitored for the following 5 days. The greatest weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) were achieved in abalone fed the BBP250 diet. Superior survival was obtained in abalone fed the BBP250, BBP500, BBP750, and BBP1000 diets to abalone fed the S. japonica control diet. The BBP250 and BBP500 diets achieved the highest survival of abalone. BBP appears to be a novel replacer for S. japonica in abalone diets, and 250 g/kg replacement of BBP for S. japonica produced the best weight gain and SGR.",10.1111/jwas.12953

The control diet (PBM0) without PBM contained 20% of FM. Based on PBM0, the other four isonitrogenous (about 30% of crude protein) and isolipidic (about 4% of crude lipid) diets were formulated replacing 25, 50, 75 and 100% of FM by PBM (designated as PBM25, PBM50, PBM75 and PBM100), respectively. Every diet was fed to triplicate cages (40 x 35 x 70 cm) with 60 abalones per cage. At the end of the feeding trial, abalones were starved for 3 days and anesthetized with 5% ethanol before sampling. Results indicated that biomass gain of the abalone fed PBM75 (916.71 g) and PBM100 (659.93 g) was significantly lower than that of the abalone fed PBM0 (1222.51 g). Feed conversion ratio of the abalone fed PBM50 (2.93), PBM75 (2.89) and PBM100 (4.04) were significantly higher than that of the abalone fed PBM0 (2.37). The muscle crude protein content of the abalone fed PBM100 (16.01% wet weight) was significantly lower than that of the abalone fed PBM0 (16.67% wet weight). Activities of trypsin and & alpha;-amylase in the digestive gland in the PBM100 group (309.21 and 0.064 U/mg prot., respectively) were significantly lower than the PBM0 group (463.57 and 0.078 U/mg prot., respectively). When the substitution levels rose over 50%, expressions of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, threonine kinase/protein B, mammalian target of rapamycin and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E in muscle were significantly reduced, while 4E binding protein was significantly increased. The most abundant phyla across the abalones' gut were Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Catalase (from 2.90 to 1.69 U/mL), superoxide dismutase (from 98.93 to 74.39 U/mL), lysozyme (from 345.86 to 247.81 U/mL) and acid phosphatase (from 21.68 to 15.71 U/100 mL) activities in cell-free hemolymph were markedly decreased with substitution level increasing. When the replacement levels rose over 50%, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 and tumor necrosis factor & alpha; expressions in the digestive gland were markedly upregulated, while & beta;-defensin and mytimacin 6 expressions were markedly downregulated. The cumulative mortality of abalone challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus (1.0 x 107 CFU/mL) for 7 days was remarkably increased in the PBM50 (83.49%), PBM75 (89.56%) and PBM100 (100%) groups compared with the PBM0 group (58.82%). In conclusion, 50% of dietary FM could be replaced by PBM without influencing abalone growth.

"Ward, PN; Leigh, JA",Genetic analysis of Streptococcus uberis plasminogen activators,2004,INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH,119,,136,140,,"Background & objectives: Streptococci produce a diverse range of secreted plasminogen activators capable of converting mammalian plasminogen to plasmin in a species-specific manner. In all examples to date, the host animal's plasminogen and that of a number of additional species have been shown to interact with these molecules leading to the conclusion that the pathogenesis. of streptococci is in some way dependent upon activation of host plasminogen. PauA was the first plasminogen activator described from Streptococcus uberis, a pathogen frequently isolated from cases of bovine mastitis. Recently, a second S. uberis plasminogen activator (PauB) was identified from a Danish mastitis isolate. Interestingly, the pauB open reading frame occupied the locus normally filled by pauA. In the present study a genetic screen of streptococcal and field isolates frequently associated with mastitis was undertaken to assess the distribution, chromosomal location and sequence variation of these putative virulence factors. Methods: Southern analysis of a diverse panel of streptococci and additional bacterial isolates frequently associated with bovine mastitis was performed using pauA and pauB probes. Sequence variation of PauA was assessed at the protein level following nucleotide sequence analysis of pauA alleles amplified from isolates picked from different geographical locations. Results: We observed plasminogen activators to be universally distributed amongst S. uberis. A pauA allele was identified in all but one strain of S. uberis. This strain had a pauB allele substituted for pauA at the same locus. The remarkably low level of sequence variation demonstrated by PauA was further restricted to a limited number of residues within the molecule. Interpretation & conclusion: The high prevalence of PauA alleles in, field isolates of S. uberis supported the observation that plasminogen activators are likely to confer an advantage with respect to colonization and growth. The findings of the present study support the theory that PauA plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of S. uberis.",

This study explores the effects of dietary grape extract (GE) from Vitis vinifera on the growth performance, oxidative stress regulation, and thermal tolerance of this commercially valuable fish. Over a 60-day feeding trial, four dietary groups were tested: a control diet without GE and three diets supplemented with GE at 2% (GE20), 3% (GE30), and 4% (GE40) with commercial feed. The results demonstrated that GE supplementation positively influenced growth, with the GE20 group achieving the best weight gain and feed conversion ratio among all groups. The upregulation of the growth-related gene igf-1 in the liver of the GE20 group further supported its superior growth performance. Additionally, GE-fed groups showed increased expression of antioxidant-related genes sod1 and sod2 in the liver, while gpx1 exhibited a significant increase only in the GE20 group, indicating enhanced antioxidant defenses. Cat gene expression remained unchanged, and higher GE doses reduced the expression of gpx1, cat, and igf-1. Furthermore, GE supplementation improved cold tolerance in all treated groups compared to the control. These findings suggest that dietary GE at 20 g/kg is particularly effective in enhancing growth performance and cold tolerance in Asian seabass, offering a promising strategy for boosting fish health and adaptability in aquaculture.",10.3390/ani14182731

Taking into account that sustainable, eco-friendly production methods are to be a part of future expansion of the abalone industry, growth performance of juvenile abalone reared in an integrated culture system was evaluated and compared with that of abalone fed non-enriched macroalgae. Four macroalgae treatments, three monospecific: Ulva rigida (UN), Hypnea spinella (HN) and Gracilaria cornea (GN) and a composite one ( MN), were produced out of fishpond wastewater effluents, while other four control treatments consisted of the same species reared in fresh seawater (U; H; G; M). Seaweeds reared in fishpond wastewater effluents increased their protein content from 11-.17% to 29-34%. Lipids consisted mainly of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (43-60%), palmitic acid being the most abundant fatty acid (40-47%). Highest EPA percentage was found in red algae H. spinella (6.9%), being ten times higher than that of U. rigida (0.7%). All the algae tested contained very low levels of arachinodic acid (0.1-1.6%) and docosahexaenoic acid (0.5-3%). Protein levels in foot muscle (74-76%) did not differ significantly (P < 0.05) among treatments. Survival was generally high, ranging from 85 to 100%. Weight gain (17-561%) and SGR (0.2-2.3%) were positively related to protein content; whereas, protein efficiency ratio (PER) (0.5-3.7) was negative correlated. PE ratios increased by 82-159% (DW) as a function of the enrichment among the different diets. Food conversion ratio (FCR) (7-188) improved according to the increase in PER. Overall, biofilter-produced macroalgae showed a significantly higher dietary value compared to the control treatments. Similarly, animals fed the mixed diets performed significantly better than those fed a single algal diet. Feeding G. cornea led to the lowest growth performance probably due to the lowest feed intake. The results clearly indicate that H. tuberculata coccinea growout can efficiently take place in an integrated-culture system suggesting that on-farm seaweed-abalone production could be part of future development of the abalone industry in the Canary Islands.

Seven isonitrogenous (about 32% of crude protein) and isolipidic (about 3% of crude lipid) diets were designed with graded levels of methionine (0.46%, 0.77%, 0.97%, 1.19%, 1.41%, 1.71% and 2.07%, respectively). The experimental diets were named as M1 (control), M2, M3, M4, M5, M6 and M7, respectively. An 84-day feeding trial was conducted in sea cages (40 cm x 35 cm x 70 cm) for abalones (initial body weight: 4.10 +/- 0.01 g), which were fed once every two days. The results showed that the biomass gain (BG) of abalone significantly increased (from 560.20 g to 643.83 g) with the increasing dietary methionine levels from 0.46% to 1.19%, and then decreased (from 643.83 g to 484.29 g) (P < 0.05). Based on the broken-line regression analysis of BG, the requirement of dietary methionine for abalone was determined to be 0.99% (dry matter of diet). The highest trypsin activity (862.10 U/mg prot.) and alpha-Amylase activity (0.28 U/mg prot.) in the intestine of abalone were observed in the M4 and M5 group, respectively. In the digestive gland, the gene expression of mtor, s6k and eif4e showed a significant quadratic trend with the increasing dietary methionine levels, and all of them reached their highest values in the M4 group. The highest mRNA level of gcn2 was observed in the M1 group. The glutathione content and total anti-oxidative capacity in cell-free hemolymph (CFH) were significantly increased as dietary methionine levels increasing from 0.46% to 1.19%, and then decreased (P < 0.05). The lowest gene expression level of keap1, nf-kappa b and tnf-alpha, and the highest gene expression level of nrf2 and i kappa b alpha in the digestive gland were found in the M4 group. After the heat stress test at the end of feeding trial, the minimum falling rate (19.44%) and the highest gene expression level of hsp70 and hsp90 in the digestive gland of abalone were found in the group with 1.19% of dietary methionine.

"FLEMING, AE",DIGESTIVE EFFICIENCY OF THE AUSTRALIAN ABALONE HALIOTIS-RUBRA IN RELATION TO GROWTH AND FEED PREFERENCE,1995,AQUACULTURE,134,3-Apr,279,293,,"The digestibilities of dry and organic matter, energy and nitrogen were determined for Haliotis rubra feeding on a range of monospecific algal diets. These digestibilities, in conjunction with total intakes, were used to estimate the daily intakes of nitrogen and energy of abalone feeding on those algal species used by Fleming (1995). These were then used to explain the growth rates, intakes and chemosensory preferences of abalone in that study. The chemosensory preferences of abalone were strongly related to the digestible nitrogen content of the algae and to a slightly lesser extent the nitrogen content of the algae, indicating the important role nitrogen plays in setting preferences in this abalone. The intakes of digestible nitrogen were significantly related to the growth rates of abalone, suggesting that nitrogen is a limiting nutrient to abalone growth, Thus, N. rubra selects those foods which maximise the intake of nitrogen and result in maximum growth rates. Energy does not appear to play a major role in setting abalone preference as the digestible energy contents of algae in this study (and in general) are similar and did not correlate with preference. The digestible nitrogen content was lowest in the 3 brown algae tested and digestibility was related to the polyphenolic content of the brown algae. This suggests that the low growth of H. rubra on these species results from the action of polyphenolic compounds, reducing nitrogen digestibility.",10.1016/0044-8486(95)00055-7

During summer, however, this resource is not always readily available and farmed abalone are often starved for short periods. The aim of this research was to assess how periodic kelp starvation influences growth of the commercially grown abalone, Haliotis midae Linnaeus. Growth of grow-out abalone was monitored on a commercial abalone farm over a period of six months and consisted of 3 treatments with 2 replicates (n = +/- 250 abalone per replicate). The treatments were: Control (abalone always given more kelp than what they typically needed); Treatment 1 (abalone fed their weekly ration only once a week); Treatment 2 (abalone fed half their weekly ration every 3 and then 4 days respectively). While the data at first suggest that the control animals outperform the treatment animals, after undergoing an initial adjustment period to the new feeding regime, the treatment animals perform better. Weight gain and feed conversion efficiencies show that the treatment animals perform better overall. The control animals generally required much more feed to produce comparable increases in both length and weight compared to the treatment animals. This study has shown that periodic bouts of starvation is beneficial to Haliotis midae, allowing variable growth spurts when returned to full feed rations.",10.1007/s10811-007-9266-4

Here we attempt to cultivate South African M. pyrifera through vegetative propagation and investigate its use as a feed for the abalone, Haliotis midae. Kelp holdfasts were attached to a rope-raft system in Saldanha Bay, South Africa, and monitored over 3 months. In addition, a 6-month H. midae feed inclusion trial was carried out, which compared the use of M. pyrifera with the predominant commercial kelp feed species, Ecklonia maxima. Young M. pyrifera grew well on the culture system, with mean upright length nearly doubling over the culture period (55.6-102.2 cm) and displayed mean upright relative growth rates between 0.99 and 1.22% day(-1). Additionally, holdfasts developed new uprights and holdfasts increased in size, growing around culture lines. Simulated partial harvesting of samples stopped upright elongation, but samples survived, whereas complete removal of uprights caused mortality. Haliotis midae fed with M. pyrifera + formulated feed (SAF 3000 (R)) displayed comparable growth rates to the E. maxima + SAF 3000 (R) diet.

The paua were kept in small baskets suspended in larger tanks, which allowed assessment of growth and mortality with three different diets (two artificial and one natural) and three different stacking densities. For all treatments, paua held inside a building with constant darkness showed significantly better growth than did those kept outside under natural (although shaded) light. Shell increments were 20-30% greater inside, but weight gains were only half this. Paua fed either of the artificial foods consistently grew better than did those fed dried Gracilaria, and growth was always better at lower stocking densities. However, Variable and often high mortality (40-50%), both inside and outside, made it difficult to use the experimental results on growth to determine optimal on-growing conditions. The implications of this for further experiments and for designing appropriate systems for on-growing paua in the warm waters of northeastern New Zealand are discussed.",

In this study, abalone Haliotis diversicolor were fed with different probiotic-supplemented diets for 180 days, containing Bacillus stratosphericus A3440, Phaeobacter daeponensis AP1220, and a mixture of the two strains. Probiotic supplementation significantly increased shell length and wet weight of juvenile abalone (p < 0.05). Compared with those non-treatment group, trypsin and lipase activities were increased significantly in the gastrointestinal tract of animals fed with A3440 or bacterial mixture (p < 0.05). A subsequent ten-day of challenging trial against Vibrio harveyi, the animals with AP1220 had similar to 90% survival rate as against similar to 60% survival rate for the non-treated animals. Likewise, in situ glutathione peroxidase, catalase, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, and superoxide dismutase assays showed that the probiotics significantly improved immune response of H. diversicolor (p < 0.05). 13,622 OTUs were obtained from abalone intestine microbiome by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. Microbial diversity indices and richness estimates in the non-treated group declined before and after Vibrio infection trial. Conversely, these indexes enhanced to different levels in probiotics treatments, and the A3440 group restored and reached the highest value. Cluster analysis showed that probiotic could re-establish and subsequently balance the gut microbial community after the challenge trial. Furthermore, these potential probiotics had a positive effect on the number of beneficial endogenous bacteria in the abalone gut, such as bacilli and actinobacterial species. Thus, dietary administration of B. stratosphericus, P. daeponensis and their mixture could improve the nutrient and health status of abalone H. diversicolor.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.05.011

The control diet was designed to contain 30% of kelp, and named as Diet-S. On the basis of the control diet, the kelp was 50% replaced by U. prolifera, U. lactuca, and G. lemaneiformis, and named as Diet-SE, Diet-SU, and Diet-SG, respectively. Results showed that the specific growth rate of abalone was not significantly influenced by the replacement of dietary kelp (P > 0.05). Dietary inclusion of U. lactuca and G. lemaneiformis significantly increased the feed efficiency but significantly decreased the feed intake of abalone (P < 0.05).

Fifteen isonitrogenous (approximately 30% CP) casein-gelatin-based diets containing five graded levels of phosphorus (0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0%) for each of three levels of calcium (0%, 1.0% and 2.0%) were fed to the animals previously fed a basal diet (0.23% total P and 0.17% total Ca) for 14 days. After 16 weeks of feeding, survival ranged from 94.7% to 100.0% with no significant difference among dietary treatments. The weight gain rate (WGR), daily increment in shell length (DISL), carcass concentrations of lipid and protein. soft-body alkaline phosphatase activity and phosphorus, zinc, manganese contents were significantly affected by dietary phosphorus levels. Supplementation of 1.0% and 2.0% calcium to the basal diet reduced soft-body phosphorus deposition and did not appear to increase the nutritive value of the diet, indicating that a dietary calcium supplement is not required under the present experimental conditions. The dietary phosphorus requirements were evaluated from the pooled WGR and DISL, respectively, by using the second-order polynomial regression analysis. On the basis of the pooled WGR and DISL, the optimum ranges of dietary available phosphorus were 0.65-1.17% (approximately 0.7-1.2% total P), and 0.64-1.14% (approximately 0.7-1.2% total P), respectively. Based on these results, about 1.15% available phosphorus (1.25% of total P) is recommended for the maximum growth of H. discus hannai, and if dietary available phosphorus is reduced from 1.15% to 0.65%, the growth of the abalone may be depressed with 5% likelihood.

In the present study, we hypothesised that kelp supplementation in formulated feed affects the profile of digestive enzymes in farmed Haliotis midae. Commercially reared sub-adult abalone fed a kelp-supplemented (Ecklonia maxima; 0.88% dry weight) or kelp-free control feed were collected for analysis of the amylase, alginate lyase, laminarinase, fucoidanase and protease activities in the gut.

This limits the success of abalone farming. Therefore, formulated diets are crucial for the ongoing expansion and sustainable development of abalone culture. The most important considerations in formulated diets are the nutrient composition and commercially available feed ingredients. This review presents a comprehensive description of the nutrient requirements of abalones and the role that nutrients play in regulating abalone growth and health. The dietary proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, macroalgae sources and feed additives currently used in abalone feeds were subsequently summarised. Additionally, this review also highlights the importance of prioritizing the development of sustainable alternative sources of proteins, carbohydrates and macroalgae to meet the increasing demand for abalone feed.

All diets were fed ad libitum (3% bw day(-1)) every second day, and growth rates were quantified over a 3-mo period, Specific growth rate (SGR) for both shell length and whole body weight indicated that growth of abalone fed enriched U. rigida was not significantly different (P > 0.05) to growth achieved from the best performing artificial diets. A 96-h salinity stress test was also conducted on all treatments to assess the effects of diet on stress resistance. Diet significantly effected survival at 20parts per thousand, with the U. rigida fed animals exhibiting decreased tolerance to hypo-osmotic conditions (P < 0.05). This may have been caused by an interference with the cell volume regulatory mechanisms normally utilized by Haliotis spp, Enrichment of wild U. rigida increased the algal protein content from 11.4 +/- 2% (dry weight) to 32.2 +/- 1.5%, perhaps, partially explaining the difference in performance between this and other abalone feed trials Utilizing Ulva spp. Results indicate that enriched U. rigida is a suitable feed for H. roci, providing similar growth to that achieved from several commercially available diets.",

AIA was the only marker that yielded consistent realistic apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs), which were comparable (P > 0.05) to values derived through total collection. Both Cr2O3 and crude fibre in faeces were either lower or similar to their respective levels in feed, resulting in negative ADCs. Leaching of markers from the diets did not have an effect (P > 0.05) on digestibility coefficients. No difference (P > 0.05) was found in apparent dry matter digestibility between faeces voided either during the night or daytime. Washing of faeces with distilled water after collection had no influence (P > 0.05) on AIA content. In all test ingredients, mean apparent amino acid availability reflected apparent protein digestibility. Apparent digestibility of protein in fish meal (76%) by H. midae was within the range of values reported for fish species (62-91%). Soybean meal is a promising feed ingredient in abalone feeds due to the high apparent digestibility of its organic matter (79%), energy (83%), protein (85%) and both essential and non-essential amino acids (mean of 86%).

Two 15-day feeding trials using 1 mm post-larvae were conducted. No significant differences were observed in sizes of post-larval abalone after 15 days in all diatom treatments (P>0.05). However, in both trials, Cocconeis sp. resulted in high survival rates (88.9 +/- 5.6% and 80.0 +/- 20.0% for Trials 1 and 2, respectively). Cocconeis sp. was efficiently digested by post-larval abalone, with most of the cells being ruptured during ingestion and/ or passage through the gut. One diatom strain, Pleurosigma sp., resulted to a high survival but produced the slowest growth rate (<10 im.d(-1) SL). It was probably not ingested easily during the experiment due to its large size or mobility. For the other diatom strains, N. mollis and N. ramosissima, most cells passed through the gut with the cells left intact. Stauroneis sp. is highly digestible, but did not result to high survival, although the remaining live post-larval abalone fed on this diatom as well as on N. mollis grew faster during the second week of both feeding trials. N. ramosissima resulted to poorest survival rate (<10%) due to its poor digestibility. Only Cocconeis sp. showed a fairly high growth rate, digestion efficiency, and survival rate. N. mollis which gave a fairly high survival rate and Stauroneis may be added towards the later stages of post-larval rearing as well as other large diatoms. The digestion efficiency of diatom strains is considered an important factor determining its dietary value, but other factors may also be important such as volume contents, biochemical composition, and other physical characteristics.",

The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), the nitric oxide levels produced by the respiratory burst of blood lymphocytes, and the expression levels of Mn-SOD in B1 and B3 were significantly higher than those in C but significantly lower than those in B2 (P < 0.05). Fourteen days after infection with V. parahaemolyticus, the cumulative mortality of abalones in B2 was significantly lower than those in B1 and C (P < 0.05). These results indicate that the food containing 10(5) cfu/mL Bacillus licheniformis promoted food intake and growth of abalones and also improved their resistance to V. parahaemolyticus infection. Thus, B. licheniformis is a good potential probiotic.",10.1016/j.fsi.2018.02.028

Seaweed, which is the feed for abalone, accounts for the highest costs in commercial farming. Genetic improvement of feed efficiency (FE) related traits in abalone could result in significant cost and energy savings. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the FE traits in Pacific abalone. A total of 25 significant single -nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected as being associated with the feed efficiency ratio (FER), and 30 significant SNPs were associated with residual feed intake (RFI). A total of 64 genes, including copb1, megf10, prxs, prdx4, myo19, ptp, ggt, aps, perlucin, and nimul, were identified as candidate genes that may affect FER or RFI traits through biological processes such as cell proliferation, nutrition metabolism, and the immune system. Furthermore, an overlapped gene (apol3) was identified as being associated with RFI by combining the results of GWAS and comparative transcriptomic analyses between the high-FE and low-FE groups. This study will not only improve our understanding of the genetics of abalone FE but will also provide valuable SNPs for molecular marker selection and breeding in the Pacific abalone.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738630

Tunic meal of sea squirt (TSS) is one of the marine fishery by-products that contains a variety of nutrients. In this study, we evaluated TSS as a substitute for FM and MA in abalone (Haliotis discus) diet. A total of 27,600 abalones was distributed into 36 net cages (2300 abalones in 3 cages/diet). Two-way [substitution source (FM and MA), and substitution ratio (50% and 100%)] ANOVA with the repeated design was used. Extruded pellets (EPs) were made up of the control diet (Con), which contained 14% FM, and 25% MA. Fifty, and 100% of both FM and MA were substituted with an equal amount of TSS, referred to as the FM50, FM100, MA50, and MA100 diets, respectively. Undaria pinnatifida was prepared to compare the effect of EPs on abalone. All experimental diets were fed to duplicate groups of abalone for 33 weeks. After the 16-week feeding trial, abalone were subjected to air, high temperature, and low salinity exposures for 24-h, and then monitored for survival. Weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone fed with the MA50 and MA100 diets were greater than those of abalone fed with all other diets, except for SGR of abalone fed with the Con diet. Chemical composition of the soft body of abalone was reflected from the dietary nutrient composition. Abalone fed the MA50 diet achieved the highest survival after the 24-h air and hightemperature exposures. Conclusively, the desirable level of substituting tunic meal of sea squirt for FM is up to 50% and 100% for MA, respectively, in extruded pellet.",10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.100935
"Huddy, RJ; Coyne, VE",Characterisation of the role of an alkaline protease from Vibrio midae SY9 in enhancing the growth rate of cultured abalone fed a probiotic-supplemented feed,2015,AQUACULTURE,448,,128,134,,"South Africa has a rapidly developing abalone aquaculture industry based largely on the cultivation of Haliotis midae. The prophylactic use of probiotic microorganisms has been shown to enhance the health, growth and nutritional status of a variety of cultured aquaculture species. Furthermore, research has shown that H. midae fed a high protein artificial diet supplemented with the proteolytic marine bacterium Vibrio midae SY9 have enhanced digestive protease activity levels, protein digestion and absorption, and growth. The predominant V. midae SY9 extracellular alkaline protease, VmproA, has been previously shown to be present in the crop/stomach and intestinal regions of H. midae fed a diet supplemented with V. midae SY9. Therefore, VmproA may be responsible for the probiotic properties of the bacterium in farmed abalone. In this study, the role of VmproA on abalone growth was investigated using the mutant strain V. midae SY9Mut2, which is unable to produce VmproA. Over the course of a 180 day laboratory-based growth trial the growth rate of small ( 28 mm) abalone improved by 6.5 and 14.5% following dietary supplementation with V. midae SY9 and V. midae SY9Mut2, respectively, in comparison to abalone fed a basal diet. In situ protease activity within the H. midae digestive tract was significantly increased in animals fed the V. midae SY9 supplemented diet compared to abalone fed either the basal feed or the V. midae SY9Mut2 supplemented diet. Thus, VmproA does not appear to be the factor responsible for increased growth of probiotic-supplemented abalone. Statement of relevance: The manuscript addresses the mechanism of how probiotics function in a farmed abalone species. This is important since probiotic supplementation of feed is proving successful in increasing the growth of these molluscs, and yet very little is known regarding the underlying relationship between the host animal and the probiont.

Measurements were made on 11 length groups of paua, 16-120 mm. Feeding rates depended on body size, with a decrease in the weight-specific grazing rate with increasing shell length up to 66 mm. Grazing rates for rhodophytes, Gracilaria sp. and Hymenocladia sanguinea exceeded those on phaeophytes, Macrocystis pyrifera and Lessonia variegata. The assimilation efficiency of paua feeding on Gracilaria sp. was the highest of the four species tested (85%). During winter, abalone grazing rates at a temperature of 10 degrees C were significantly reduced compared with summer values at 17.5 degrees C. Consumption rates on the kelp L. variegata were similar during summer and winter. Laboratory experiments investigated the effects of density on the feeding and growth rate of juvenile paua, initial length 35-45 mm, over a year. Although feeding rates were relatively constant with increasing density, annual length increment decreased At densities greater than 40 individuals per cubicle (400 m(-2)), there was no length increase and individuals lost weight. The highest growth rate was found at the lowest density, where an annual length increment of 9.2 mm was about half that recorded from field populations. The grazing rates of the black foot paua feeding on natural algal food are discussed in relation to their natural diet, and the algae are evaluated for their potential use as a food supply for abalone mariculture.",

Both the intestines and intestinal microbiota play a key role in energy acquisition and influence FE. In the current research, intestinal microbiota, metabolome, and key digestive enzyme activities were compared between abalones with high [Residual feed intake (RFI) = -0.029] and low FE (RFI = 0.022). The FE of group A were significantly higher than these of group B. There were significant differences in intestinal microbiota structures between high- and low-FE groups, while higher microbiota diversity was observed in the high-FE group. Differences in FE were also strongly correlated to variations in intestinal digestive enzyme activity that may be caused by Pseudoalteromonas and Cobetia. In addition, Saprospira, Rhodanobacteraceae, Llumatobacteraceae, and Gaiellales may potentially be utilized as biomarkers to distinguish high- from low-FE abalones. Significantly different microorganisms (uncultured beta proteobacterium, BD1_7_clade, and Lautropia) were found to be highly correlated to significantly different metabolites [DL-methionine sulfoxide Arg-Gln, L-pyroglutamic acid, dopamine, tyramine, phosphatidyl cholines (PC) (16:0/16:0), and indoleacetic acid] in the high- and low-FE groups, and intestinal trypsin activity also significantly differed between the two groups. We propose that interactions occur among intestinal microbiota, intestinal metabolites, and enzyme activity, which improve abalone FE by enhancing amino acid metabolism, immune response, and signal transduction pathways. The present study not only elucidates mechanisms of variations in abalone FE, but it also provides important basic knowledge for improving abalone FE by modulating intestinal microbiota.",10.3389/fmicb.2022.852460

Animals were fed one of the four formulated test diets containing graded levels of UPE (0%, 5%, 10%, and 20%) or a commercial diet that served as a control for the 0% basal diet. Diets were formulated to contain 37% crude protein, 5% lipid, and 17.5 MJ/ kg gross energy. The specific growth rate and shell growth rate (mm/day) of abalone fed the four experimental diets were similar. Dietary inclusions of UPE supported the growth of juvenile greenlip abalone and may be used to reduce dietary inclusions of solvent extracted soybean meal, dehulled lupins, and wheat flour. Currently, UPE is cost prohibitive for commercial use in greenlip abalone diet. As UPE is a by-product of the macroalgae industry, the cost of UPE would likely become more economically viable as macroalgae production increases in the future to include in diets for greenlip abalone.

Subsequently, a great deal of research primarily focused on improving the health and growth rates of abalone were carried out to maximise productivity of the commercial farming efforts in various countries. In this review, we comprehensively describe the most recent available scientific literature on abalone biology, and those aspects related to the growth of this organism; more specifically, those factors related to the uptake and breakdown of metabolic products which ensures long-term growth. We subsequently discuss this in terms of basic animal design, farming outcomes, feeding, cellular growth mechanisms and the unique metabolic processes that exist in these species. Using this information and the knowledge of the metabolic processes in other organisms, we additionally make a number of new hypotheses regarding how these metabolic processes may function in terms of abalone growth.

Abalone were fed the respective diets in a three month laboratory trial and an additional four month on-farm trial. The inclusion of MSM into formulated abalone diet did not change lip, foot, or shell colour, whereas the G. cliftonii meal treatment changed lip and shell colour. The laboratory study was extended for another three months. Greenlip abalone either: (1) continued to be fed their experimental diet; or (2) the abalone were fed a diet with no dried algal meal. The colour changes observed in the first study were retained for one month, after which the colour declined. The addition of 15% G. cliftonii meal to formulated diets can be used to manipulate greenlip abalone lip and shell colour. A minimum of three months is recommended and abalone should be harvested within one month to maintain the desirable colour changes.",10.1080/00288330.2023.2293734

Four species of macroalgae (Ulva rigida, Ecklonia maxima, Porphyra capensis and Gigartina polycarpa) were assessed by pairwise preference tests. Each macroalgal species was consumed at least once by Tripneustes gratilla and significant preferences always involved Ulva as the most preferred species. Four protein-rich artificial diets supplemented with varying amounts of Ulva [0, 50, 150 and 200 g kg(-1) designated 0, 5, 15 and 20U, respectively] were then developed and fed to urchins over a 20-day period. Inclusion of 200 g kg(-1) dried Ulva significantly improved the palatability of the artificial diet and mean dry feed consumption rates were higher in urchins fed the 20U and 15U diets compared with urchins fed diets with a lower Ulva content. Daily digestible protein (DP) intake also differed significantly, with urchins fed the 20U diet having a significantly higher DP intake compared with the 15U, 5U and 0U treatments. These results indicate that inclusion of the palatable seaweed Ulva acted as a feeding stimulant, increasing the acceptability of the diets and boosting protein intake.",10.1111/anu.12182

Temperature has important effects on the feeding and growth of abalone, and genotype by environment (G x E) interactions should be considered in selecting breeding programs for genetic gain. To improve the selection strategy, FE performance, genetic parameters, and G x E interactions of abalone were measured and evaluated at 17 degrees C, 21 degrees C, and 27 degrees C. The feed efficiency ratio (FER) showed a similar degree of phenotypic variation at all three temperatures, with the best phenotypic performance at 17 degrees C. The heritability of FER was high (0.55-0.72) and relatively stable at different temperatures, while the heritability of residual feed intake (RFI) changed with temperature and was 0.21 at 27 degrees C. The FER had a high positive genetic correlation (0.68-0.75) with specific growth rates (SGRs) and a genetic correlation ranging from 0.32 to 0.81 with food intake (FI).

Two experiments were conducted over 93 days to test the effect of diet on the colour of the foot and shell of 1-year old greenlip abalone Haliotis laevigata. In Experiment 1, a commercial control diet and two species of fresh macroalgae (Gracilaria cliftonii and Ulva sp.) were used and each macroalgae species was either non-enriched or enriched with nutrients in the culture media. The shell of abalone fed the commercial diet and fresh Ulva sp. was green but abalone fed fresh G. cliftonii developed a brown shell. The fresh G. cliftonii increased shell colour purity while fresh Ulva sp. increased shell brightness. Feeding abalone with either fresh Ulva or fresh G. cliftonii produced yellowish foot. Nutrient enrichment of algae did not significantly affect the pigment contents in both macroalgae and abalone, and had minimal impact on the colour of shell and foot. With the exception of zeaxanthin, the pigment contents were significantly lower in fresh G. cliftonii than in fresh Ulva sp. Moreover, beta-carotene was the main pigment in abalone fed both species of fresh macroalgae. In Experiment 2, the inclusion of dietary dried algae affected abalone colour. Three diets including a commercial control diet, a diet containing 3% dried Spirulina sp. and a diet containing 10% dried Ulva sp. were used. The shell of abalone fed dried Spirulina sp. was yellow-brown with higher colour purity while the shell remained light green in abalone fed dried Ulva sp. or the commercial control diet. The colour of abalone foot became bright yellow when abalone fed dried Ulva sp. Abalone fed dried algae contained beta-carotene as the principal pigment. This study indicates that fresh macroalgae and dried algae supplementation in feed can change the colour of abalone foot and shell. Feed effect on shell colour was far more than on tissue colour.

Abalones were divided into two groups: eyestalk-ablated (EA) and control (C), and were cultured for 60 days. Results showed that the EA group exhibited significantly higher growth rates in body weight compared to the C group. However, the EA group also had a higher mortality rate, indicating the negative consequences of eyestalk ablation. The feeding rate was significantly higher in the EA group, especially during nocturnal feeding, suggesting that eyestalk ablation may specifically affect nocturnal feeding behavior in abalone. Both EA and C groups displayed rhythmic oscillations in movement activity, with no significant differences in mesor and amplitude. Nevertheless, the peak of populational movement proportion in the EA group occurred approximately 2 h earlier than that in the C group. Transcriptome analysis identified 417 circadian genes, with the most significant enrichment found in the growth-related thyroid hormone signaling pathway. The expression of five core clock genes (clock, cry, rho, tipin, per) exhibited significant circadian rhythms in H. discus hannai, while their rhythmic oscillation significance was weaker in the EA group, except for the tipin transcript. These findings reveal that eyestalk ablation affects growth, feeding and locomotor behavior, and clock gene expression in abalone, providing valuable insights for understanding the circadian regulatory mechanisms and physiological ecological adaptations of abalone. However, due to its harmful effects on animal welfare and the limited promotion of growth, this technology is not advocated for use in aquaculture practices.",10.1016/j.aqrep.2023.101807

The radula of competent larvae contained 11-13 transverse rows of teeth after 6-7 days at 20 degreesC. The number of rows increased to 25-30 during the first several days after settlement, but then remained approximately constant throughout the postlarval period, increasing again in abalone larger than 4 mm in shell length (SL). In post-larvae < 1 mm SL, only two pairs of lateral teeth (L1, L2) were present in the larval radula. An additional three pairs of lateral teeth (L3-L5) were added progressively as post-larvae grew from 0.9 mm to 1.9 mm SL. Marginal teeth were added steadily from one pair in larvae to 30-40 pairs at 3-4 mm SL, 70-80 pairs in 30-40 mm juveniles, and 70-90 pairs in 90-100 mm adults. The serrations on the working edges of the rachidian (R) and lateral teeth became less pronounced as the abalone grew. Nearly all serrations disappeared from the rachidian (R) and inner lateral teeth (L1, L2) by similar to2 mm SL, and from the outer lateral teeth (L3-L5) by 20 mm SL. For abalone larger than 1.5 mm SIL, the L3-L5 teeth became longer and more pointed, which increased the space between adjacent rows of teeth. Post-larvae < 1 mm SL had highly curved teeth with clearance angles of approximately or less than zero, whereas larger abalone had positive clearance angles. These radula developments appear to be related to transitions in feeding habits from microbial to macroalgal diets.",10.1046/j.1444-2906.2001.00295.x

The abalone fed G. cliftonii meal developed brown-red colour on the shell and the increased inclusion of algal meal resulted in darker brown shells, whereas abalone fed Ulva sp. meal or the basal diet exhibited light green shells. Although foot hue and foot brightness were not influenced by the type and level of inclusion of dried algal meal, the foot colour saturation of abalone fed >= 10% macroalgal meal was significantly higher than those fed the basal diet. Abalone developed a green lip when fed >= 10% of G. cliftonii meal, whereas lip colour did not change when fed Ulva sp. meal inclusion, compared to the basal diet, and exhibited milky lip colour. Although diet pigments varied with the species of macroalgae and inclusion level, beta-carotene was the major pigment in the tissue of abalone fed all test diets and its content increased significantly with the inclusion level of macroalgae in the diet. Abalone fed the basal diet had significantly lower tissue p-carotene than those fed the diets with macroalgal inclusion. This study suggests that the inclusion of >= 5% G. cliftonii can produce a brown-red shell and the inclusion of >= 10% G. cliftonii intensifies the green colour of the lip.

In the present study, the effects of dietary Schizochytrium sp. on the metabolic and intestinal microbial responses, and the intestinal histological structure were investigated in zebrafish. Three experimental diets containing different concentrations of Schizochytrium sp. (0, 60, and 120 g/kg, respectively) were formulated to feed zebrafish for 56 days. The challenge trial with the fish pathogen (Edwardsiella piscicida) showed that a diet with 120 g/kg Schizochytrium sp. significantly increased the survival rate of zebrafish. Additionally, the highest goblet cell density in the intestinal wall was observed in zebrafish fed with 120 g/kg Schizochytrium sp. Metabolomic analysis of humoral fluids indicated that the diet supplemented with Schizochytrium sp. boosted the TCA cycle, energy supply, taurine metabolism, and L-serine metabolism, whereas cholesterol metabolism decreased in zebrafish. The microbiome analysis revealed that a 120 g/kg Schizochytrium sp. supplemented diet could remarkably increase the abundance of beneficial bacteria (i.e., Lactobacillus, Dorea, Butyricicoccus, and Pseudoxanthomonas), and reduce several potential pathogens (i.e., Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, Citrobacter, and Mycoplasmas). Combined omics analysis indicated that Dorea and Butyricicoccus species were related to the disease resistance in fish. The results of dual-omics analysis also revealed that Schizochytrium sp. had the potential to improve some metabolism related to immune function and intestinal health, thus enhancing the disease resistance of zebrafish.

At that stage animals need to be moved into a different tank system and weaned onto a formulated feed or alternative algal diets consisting of diatoms or macroalgae that can provide more biomass for the growing juveniles. Two trials were conducted to compare the growth and survival of juvenile greenlip abalone (5.9 +/- 0.6 and 7.1 +/- 0.1 mm in initial shell length) in two rearing systems: (1) shallower tanks with or without horizontal shelter, feeding a commercial formulated feed on horizontal surfaces; (2) deeper tanks with plate system feeding algal diets. The second experiment included two algal diets and two abalone stocking densities for one of the algal diets. The first experiment revealed that the algal diet consisting of Ulvella lens produced the best growth rates during the first 4 wk of the experiment, when juveniles reached about 9 mm in shell length and seawater temperatures averaged 20.1 degrees C. Growth rates on the Ulvella diet declined rapidly thereafter, whereas growth rates on formulated feeds increased, coinciding with a decrease in seawater temperature to 15.2 degrees C at the end of the experiment. The formulated feed produced high growth rates (over 75 mu m day(-1)) once juveniles reached 7 mm in shell length. In the second experiment, the algal diet that included germlings of the green alga Ulva sp. produced the highest growth rates (105 pm day(-1)), indicating that Ulva sp. germlings are a suitable additional food source for juvenile greenlip abalone. Growth rates were particularly high towards the end of the experiment when seawater temperatures were above 19 degrees C. Juveniles stocked at higher density (80 juveniles per plate) feeding on one of the algal diets showed reduced growth rates and overall lower average weight gain per individual compared with the juveniles stocked at low density and juveniles in the tank system feeding on formulated diet. In both experiments the survival was higher on the algal diets (77% to 82%) than on the formulated feed (62% to 65%). Culturing and maintaining algae for larger juveniles in the nursery system involved more labor, compared with the tank systems feeding formulated feed, suggesting that in higher labor cost countries, juveniles should be weaned onto a formulated feed as early as possible. We recommend moving animals into a tank system to feed formulated feed once they reach 7 mm in shell length. The weaning process can be delayed (e.g., to 17 mm shell length) by supplementing with macroalgal germlings if the seawater temperature is high and high mortality is expected when weaning onto formulated diets.

The lipase activity in the groups with 0.98 and 0.55 dietary EPA/DHA ratio was significantly higher than those in other groups. And 1.59 dietary EPA/DHA ratio significantly increased alpha-amylase activity. In regard to the intestinal microbiota, the 0.98 dietary EPA/DHA ratio significantly increased the diversity indices and number of OTUs in the intestine, followed by the 2.19 dietary EPA/DHA ratio. At the phyla level, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacterioidota and Actinobacteria were dominant in all groups. The Mycoplasma was the most prevalent genus among all the groups. The highest abundance of Clostridium_sensu_stricto_11, Mycobacterium and Bacteroides belonged to the group with the 0.38 dietary EPA/DHA ratio. The abundance of Bacilli, Terasakiellacease and Ahrensia in 0.38 group were higher than that in the group with 0.98 and 2.19 dietary EPA/DHA ratio. Moreover, 1.59 dietary EPA/DHA ratio significantly reduced the falling rate of abalone after heat stress. And the hsp70 and hsp90 mRNA expression levels in the digestive gland were up-regulated significantly in the group with the 2.19 dietary EPA/DHA ratio. The 0.98 dietary EPA/DHA ratio could increase the content of malondialdehyde in cell-free hemolymph and the expressions of tnfa and nrf2 in digestive gland. In conclusion, the optimal dietary EPA/DHA ratio for abalone was estimated to be 1.63 using a second-order quadratic regression based on WGR. The 1.59-2.19 dietary EPA/DHA ratio could increase the immunity and resistance of abalone against heat stress.",10.1016/j.aqrep.2024.102085

Proteoglycan granules and acidophilic granules were detected in the digestive cells. The abundance of both granule types was variable, according to the nutritional state of the animals. The granular content of the digestive cells of conchs fed with artificial diets was scarce when compared with conchs fed on natural food. Of the nine formulated feeds, the diet with 365 and 45 g kg(-1) of protein and lipids, respectively, gave the best growth in weight (0.20 g day(-1)) and was also associated with digestive cells in the best condition as determined histologically.

However, the potential for replacing fish meal (FM) with CGM in abalone feeds has not been adequately evaluated. A 110-day feeding trial was conducted to evaluate effects of replacing FM with CGM on abalone Haliotis discus hannai (initial weight: 21.83 +/- 0.25 g). The control diet (CGM0) was designed to contain 20% of FM. The other four isonitrogenous (about 30% of crude protein) and isolipidic (about 4% of crude lipid) experimental diets were formulated with CGM protein replacing 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of dietary FM protein, respectively. The five experimental diets were named as CGM0, CGM25, CGM50, CGM75 and CGM100, respectively. Results showed that no significant differences were found in survival rate among all the groups. Weight gain rate (WGR) of abalone in the CGM100 group was significantly lower than that in the control group. There were no significant differences in WGR among the CGM25, CGM50, CGM75 and the control groups. The increasing dietary CGM inclusion level elevated the operational taxonomic units, ACE estimator and Chao1 estimator, and changed the intestinal microbiota composition in abalone. The activities of trypsin, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and Na+, K+-ATPase in digestive gland were significantly decreased when replacement level over 50%. The increasing dietary CGM inclusion level significantly downregulated the expressions of ribosomal S6 protein kinase (s6k), mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eif4e) in digestive gland. The CGM75 and CGM100 groups had significant lower activities of catalase and lysozyme in cell-free hemolymph and digestive gland. In conclusion, CGM could replace 75% of dietary FM (equivalent to 16.2% of CGM inclusion level in the diet) without significantly affecting the growth of abalone. However, high inclusion levels of CGM in diets (> 10.8%) had negative effects on intestinal microbiota, mTOR pathway and immunity in abalone.",10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.101007

Fusarium verticillioides is one of the most dominant toxigenic fungal species, associated with fumonisin contamination in grain-based feeds, such as compound abalone feed. Mycotoxin production is influenced by temperature and available nutrients. In this study the aims were: to determine if abalone feed as growth substrate favours mycotoxin production for toxigenic fungi; to determine the most effective temperature for fumonisin production by F. verticillioides on abalone feed; and to assess the effect of the aquatic environment on fumonisin-contaminated abalone feed. A total of 93 fungal isolates were inoculated onto abalone feed, including species belonging to the genera Fusarium, Aspergillus and Penicillium. Feed inoculated with F. verticillioides were incubated at two different temperatures and fumonisin-contaminated feed was submerged into seawater for 24 h. Results showed that mycotoxins were produced when abalone feed was inoculated with toxigenic fungi, and that F. verticillioides produced higher concentrations of fumonisins at a lower temperature. Submerging fumonisin-contaminated feed in seawater showed that this toxin leached into the seawater, lowering the risk of fumonisins to be consumed by abalone.",10.1080/21501203.2019.1604575

The basal diet was designed with 20 % of FM. Based on it, the FM was replaced by SPC at 0 (CON), 25 % (SPC25), 50 % (SPC50), 75 % (SPC75) and 100 % (SPC100), respectively. After the 110-day feeding trial, it was shown that completely replacing FM with SPC had no adverse effects on growth, feed utilization and body composition of abalone. The highest weight gain rate of abalone was 119.52 %, which was observed in the SPC25 group. The trypsin activity in the digestive gland within the SPC25 and SPC50 groups exhibited a significant increase compared to that in the remaining groups. Relative to the CON group, the SPC100 group showed a significant reduction in total antioxidant capacity and an increase in malondialdehyde content within the cell-free hemolymph (CFH). The myd88 mRNA expression in the SPC25-SPC75 groups was significantly decreased compared with other groups. The highest expressions of pi3k, , mtor and s6k, , and the lowest expression of 4e-bp were found in the SPC25 group. The hardness of muscle was significantly increased with the increasing dietary SPC levels. The CON, SPC25, and SPC50 groups exhibited significantly lower cumulative mortality rates among abalones following the V. parahaemolyticus challenge. In conclusion, in terms of growth, FM can be totally replaced by SPC. Furthermore, replacing 25 % of dietary FM with SPC led to a significant enhancement in abalone growth. Moderately replacing FM with SPC (up to 50 %) could improve abalone digestive capacity and did not significantly affect abalone survival following a V. parahaemolyticus challenge. The optimal replacement level of FM by SPC (<= <= 25 %) triggered the PI3K/AKT/ TOR pathway to promote protein synthesis. Considering the growth, digestion, immunity, muscle quality and disease resistance of abalone, it is recommended that dietary FM can be replaced by SPC not more than 50 %.",10.1016/j.aqrep.2024.102368

In the current study, an in-depth investigation of the food value of Sargassum horneri as a replacement for Undaria pinnatifida on growth, body composition, body histology, gut microbiota, and the taste sensory profile of abalone Haliotis discus hannai was carried out. After a 12-week feeding trial, the results indicated that 25% replacement (SH25) induced the highest shell-growth performance and best feed utilization values, although there was no significant difference in weight-related growth parameters with the basal (no inclusion of S. horneri) and 50% replacement (SH50) diets. Interestingly, the highest protein content was detected in abalone fed the basal diet followed by SH25 and SH50. The high replacement of S. horneri in the diet showed signs of structural integrity loss in the digestive gland. The results from the pyrosequencing of the genomic DNA from the gut of the abalone indicated an insignificant difference in alpha-diversity parameters and only a clear boundary was observed between SH0 and SH100 diets based on principal coordinate analysis. The bacterial genera Psychrilobacter, Vibrio, and Mycoplasma predominantly occupied the gut of the abalone, although there is a difference in their relative abundance. The taste screening experiment through the use of an electronic tongue showed a comparable taste profile of the abalone and is independent of the diets given.

The use of cultivated macroalgae in place of such feeds could provide for better environmental, nutritional and/or economic outcomes for this industry. However, direct comparison trials using macroalgae and formulated crop feeds are rare, and it is therefore difficult to ascertain the benefits and costs of each feed type. This study compares the benefits to growth and performance of the cultivated hybrid abalone cross (Haliotis rubra 1814 Leach and Haliotis laevigata 1808 Donovan) which was fed one of eight dietary treatments, including two commercially formulated pellet feeds and six mixed macroalgae dietary treatments. Macroalgae dietary treatments comprised the three macroalgae species Grateloupia turuturu Yamada, Ulva australis Areschoug and/or Ulva laetevirens Areschoug. Four replicate tubs, each containing 40 juvenile abalone (10-15 mm), were used to test each dietary treatment over a 12-week period. Macroalgae dietary treatments provided for significantly higher specific growth rates of abalone compared to formulated feeds, by orders of magnitude, for both length (> 0.2 % compared to < 0.1 % day(-1), F (7, 31) = 22.3, p < 0.0001) and weight (from < 0.4 to > 0.8 % day(-1), F (7, 31) = 24.4, p < 0.0001). In addition, abalone health and condition increased, and the proximate composition of abalone tissue had a higher carbohydrate/protein ratio, higher ash content and lower lipid content. These findings suggest that the juvenile abalone may benefit from macroalgae diets in comparison to two formulated feeds as a result of optimal proximate composition of the algae biomass and improved condition of the abalone.",10.1007/s10811-013-9998-2

Four treatment diets were then investigated: a formulated diet; plantlets from culture Macrocystis pyrifera, Porphyra columbina from natural beds; and a mixed diet consisting of a blend of fresh P. columbina together with the formulated diet. This study was performed in a shallow aquaculture system with a horizontal water flow. After 90 days, significant differences were observed between treatments. The highest growth was obtained with Porphyra (3.3 mm month-1), followed by the mixed diet (2.6 mm month-1), then Macrocystis (2.1 mm month-1) and lastly the formulated diet (1.4 mm month-1). Moreover, after the diets were tested for stability and remnant nutrients after a 12-h water immersion, a positive trend appeared to be related to the protein/energy (P:E). It is concluded that fronds of P. columbina resulted in the best diet for weaning H. rufescens under horizontal water flow systems, even if apparently the water stability of the formulated diet had a negative impact on abalone performance, particularly due to a poor nutrient retention capacity. Therefore, formulated diets should be improved before being recommended for weaning red abalone.",10.1111/j.1365-2109.2009.02267.x

The study involved three growth experiments: (E1) diets containing 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5% of FO, respectively; (E2) diets in which FO was serially replaced by 25, 50, 75 and 100% FlaxO, respectively; and (E3) diets in which FO was serially replaced by 25, 50, 75 and 100% CO, respectively. Results In Experiment 1, abalone fed a diet supplemented with 1.5% FO showed a significantly higher (121.2 +/- 1.1 mg day1) daily growth rate of weight (DGRw) compared to control (70.1 +/- 1.71 mg day1). In Experiment 2, abalone fed 1.5% FO diet and diets containing 2575% FlaxO showed no significant differences in DGRw. The diet containing 100% FlaxO showed significantly lower (63.3 +/- 6.7 mg day1) DGRw. In Experiment 3, abalone fed diets containing 25% and 50% CO showed similar DGRw as those fed a 1.5% FO diet. The diet containing 75% and 100% CO showed significantly lower (63.7 +/- 5.0 to 95.4 +/- 5.1 mg day1) DGRw. Conclusion Supplementation with 1.5% of dietary FO can improve growth performance in cultured abalone. It is feasible to replace 75% of dietary FO with FlaxO and 50% of dietary FO with CO, without negative effect on growth performance. (C) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry",10.1002/jsfa.5905

Food was generally given every other day at a rate of 30% and 3% of total body weight for Graciliaria tenuistipitata and artificial diet, respectively. Survival was 64.3-71.4% and 61.4-78.6% in the Gracilaria and artificial diet, respectively. Growth of abalone placed on the top tier was inferior to those placed on the middle and bottom tiers. In the first 33 days, the growth rate of H. diversicolor supertexta fed Gracilaria and the artificial diet was 61-101 and 105-163 mu m/day, respectively. The abalone fed an artificial diet gained twice as much total body weight as those fed Gracilaria after 96 days. The overall growth rate of abalone fed an artificial diet was 24.4, 47.7, and 47.9 mg/day, or 1.8, 2.2, and 2.2 times higher than abalone fed Gracilaria, on the top, middle, and bottom tiers, respectively. The FCR (feed conversion ratio) in dry weight of food was 3.10, 2.68, and 2.76 for the abalone fed an artificial diet, and 4.43, 3.03, and 3.04 for those fed Gracilaria. It is concluded that H. diversicolor supertexta placed in a multiple-tier basket system and fed an artificial diet could grow to market size (>40 mm shell length) in less than half the time in comparison to those fed on Gracilaria.",

Thus, the aim of the present work was to evaluate the physiological responses from juvenile green abalone (Haliotis fulgens), grouped according to size, in a standard controlled culture condition within their optimal range to create the balanced growth equation within an allometric relation, providing a basic framework for physiological research into H. fulgens. Feed intake, absorption efficiency, respiration and excretion were measured as functions of dry tissue weight (DTW) in juvenile abalone acclimated on a balanced diet. The daily feed intake (1) was related to body mass by the relationship I (mg day(-1)) = 24.25W(0.59). Absorption efficiency averaged 87% and was independent of body size. The equation relating daily respiration rate (R) to body mass was R (ml O-2 day(-1))= 12.013W(0.704), including night correction. The rate of ammonia excretion (0 was related to dry tissue weight by the equation U (mumol N-NH4 day(-1)) = 43.57W(0.85). The energetic value of food was 18.8 J mg(-1). The low feeding activity (< 1% of abalone live weight per day) was compensated for by a relatively high absorption efficiency and a depression of 23% in the metabolic rate during diurnal activity. Gross and net growth efficiencies were constant throughout the size range, with average values of 36.4% and 41.5%, respectively. Values of the ON ratio, with an average of 31.5, showed a higher use of proteins from the diet as an energy source for the size range studied. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

There were no significant differences in the total hemocyte count, respiratory burst, or superoxide dismutase glutathione peroxidase among all treatments. Shrimp fed a higher concentration of the probiotic (E208) exhibited significant increases in phenoloxidase activity, phagocytic activity, and clearance efficiency compared to control shrimp.

Survival was ca. 100% at 20 degrees C, and between 68% and 75% at 25 degrees C. The highest gross growth rate (109 +/- 4.3 mu m d(-1), 69 +/- 3.9 mg d(-1)) was observed in abalone from the combination 20 degrees C-00:24 L:D. Slowest GGR (38 +/- 4.1 mu m d(-1), 26 1.5 mg d(-1)) was observed in the combination 25 degrees C-24:00 LID. Organisms from 25 degrees C exhibited signs of the withering syndrome at the end of the experiment. Gross energy content (4.4 to 4.6 kcal g(-1) tissue dry wt, TDW) and crude protein (60 to 68% TDW) were not significantly affected by either temperature or photoperiod, but organisms from 20 degrees C exhibited lower moisture content (86.8 to 88.6%) and higher tissue:shell ratio (0.34-0.40) than those from 25 degrees C (88.9 to 92.1%; 0.22-0.31 respectively).

Highest C was observed under continuous darkness (0.66 to 0.95% BW d(-1) at 20 degrees C and 0.84 to 1.25% BW d(-1) at 25 degrees C), and was lowest under continuous light (0.50 to 0.82% BW d(-1) at 20 degrees C and 0.71 to 1.02% BW d-1 at 25 degrees C). FCR and PER were both affected by temperature but not by photoperiod. Higher PER (2.2 to 3.4) and lower FCR values (0.69 to 1.05) were observed at 20 degrees C, when compared to 25 degrees C (PER 1.35 to 2.09, FCR 1.10 to 1.86). Sex ratios were ca. 1: 1 in the 00:24 and 12:12 L:D photoperiods, yet ca. 50% of abalone from the 24:00 L:D photoperiod were immature at the end of the experiment.

In addition, the amount of time feeding by DF during the day and at night was significantly higher compared with that of DD, especially at ZT8 (20:00), ZT12 (24:00), ZT16 (04:00), and ZT20 (08:00), with the proportion of time feeding by DF increasing 2.22-, 1.60-, 2.71-, and 2.40-fold compared with those of DD, respectively. The maximum values of pepsase activity in DD and DF, of alpha-amylase activity in DD, and of alginate lyase activity in DF coincided with the peak feeding period. Relative to the changes in expression levels of neuropeptide Y receptor (NPYR) in the intestine, diurnal changes in NPYR expression levels in cerebral ganglia were consistent with the changes in feeding behavior, being highest at 24:00 h in both DD and DF and then declining. There was no significant difference in the circadian expression levels of cholecystokinin receptor (CCKR) in the cerebral ganglia, whereas, in the intestinal tract, peak CCKR expression levels coincided with its anorexigenic effect; the expression levels of CCKR in the intestinal tract exhibited a significant circadian rhythm in DD. These results explain the growth advantage of DF over DD in terms of feeding behavior and digestive physiology, and support the hypothesis that diurnal changes in feeding-related genes in the nervous and digestive systems are correlated with the initiation of abalone feeding behavior.

Energy budget models, which also accounted for shell growth energy and mucus production energy, were determined for each diet. Results varied in relation to energy budget components and diets. Overall, abalone fed the enriched G. cliftonii ingested significantly more dietary energy and exhibited higher somatic growth energy compared to those fed the commercial diet, the 0% control diet or the enriched Ulva sp. diets. Additionally, ingested feed energy decreased while somatic growth energy tended to increase with increasing enriched G. cliftonii meal inclusion level. In contrast, inclusion at any level with enriched Ulva sp. meal did not result in an improvement of somatic growth energy compared to the commercial or the 0% control diet. For ingested feed energy, 20% enriched Ulva sp. meal inclusion resulted in significantly higher values compared to either the commercial diet, control diet or the two other enriched Ulva sp. meal diets. However, abalone fed the 20% dried Ulva sp. meal diet lost significantly more energy through faecal egestion than those fed the commercial or the 0% control diets, suggesting reduced diet digestibility with increasing enriched Ulva sp. inclusion. The majority of ingested feed energy was allocated to somatic growth across treatments, while shell growth energy accounted for the smallest proportion of the energy budgets. Results suggest that the inclusion of enriched G. cliftonii meal (10% inclusion optimum) in formulated diets for Greenlip Abalone has energetic benefits for feed utilisation and growth which may lead to improved business productivity.

Growth of juvenile Haliotis midae was monitored on a commercial abalone farm over a period of 9 months in an experiment consisting of 9 treatments with 4 replicates (n = 250 individuals per replicate). The treatments were: fresh kelp (Ecklonia maxima) blades (seaweed control); Abfeed (R) (formulated feed control); kelp + Abfeed (R) dried kelp pellets; dried kelp blades; dried kelp stipes; fresh kelp with the epiphyte Carpoblepharis flaccida; a mixed diet (Gracilaria gracilis, Ulva lactuca, and kelp) and a rotational diet (abalone were fed 1 of the 9 treatments for the first week and them kelp for the next 3 weeks). Results show that abalone grow well on all fresh seaweed combinations, but grow best on a mixed diet. The likely reason for the success of the mixed diet is that the red and green seaweed was farm grown, with an increased protein content. Dried kelp in any form produced poor growth.

In terms of shell length, the artificial diet produced faster growth rates than G. heteroclada for the first 75 days but from Day 90 onwards, faster growth rates were observed in juveniles fed G. heteroclada. Reductions in daily growth rates of juveniles during the latter phase of the growth trial were attributed to channelling of energy into gonad development. G. heteroclada promoted high growth rates over a long-term period (360 days) and is considered to be best suited for abalone farming in the Philippines.",10.1016/S0044-8486(96)01332-4

Three semi-purified experimental diets were formulated containing 0.00, 94.52, and 9 649.58 mg/kg of vitamin C supplied as L-ascorbyl-2-monophosphate. The results show that there was no significant difference in weight gain ratio, daily increment in shell length, and survival rate among the three treatments. Adding dietary vitamin C (9 649.58 mg/kg) significantly increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathine peroxidase (GPX), glitathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), and lysozyme in viscera (P<0.05). In muscle, activities of phenoloxidase, catalase, SOD, GST, GR, and AKP were increased in the treatment with 9 649.58 mg/kg of dietary vitamin C (P<0.05). The highest concentrations of ascorbic acid in viscera and muscle were found in the group with 9 649.58 mg/kg of dietary vitamin C (P<0.05).

This study examined the poorly understood feeding habits and preferences of H. iris in a series of laboratory experiments. Generally, H. iris consumed the blades of brown algae over red and green algae. However, when upright whole plants were given to H. iris, the highly preferred kelp Lessonia variegata was consumed in lower proportions than the less preferred but more accessible red alga Gigartina circumcincta. H. iris were less capable of reaching the blades or consuming the stipe of L. variegata, which has a stipe of similar to 100-350 mm high. H. iris consumed greater amounts of drift over benthic L. vareigata. Water movement appeared to inhibit the active grazing of H. iris, but not the drift-trapping behavior, resulting in lower overall feeding rates for abalone under conditions of higher water movement. Abalone consumed fresh and aged algae equally. We conclude that H. iris feeds primarily on drift algae because preferred food sources are more accessible as drift that as attached macroalgae, and because this may be a more successful foraging strategy in the high flow environment this species commonly inhabits.",10.2983/035.028.0323

Abalone aquaculture is still a developing industry, and at least two major issues, nutrition and health, impede its development. Abalone are fed macroalgae on-farm in a number of countries, including China, Korea, South Africa and Chile. Formulated diets are crucial to the success of abalone aquaculture in countries where abalone do not grow readily when fed brown macroalgae or when access to macroalgae is insufficient for culture. Typically, the growth rate of abalone fed formulated diets is higher than abalone fed live macroalgae. However, due to a long production period, diets for abalone not only need to sustain high growth rates, but also maintain optimal health. Feeding live macroalgae improves the feeding activity, health and marketability of abalone. In this review, the nutritional requirements of abalone and dietary ingredients used in formulated diets will be discussed, together with the use of dried macroalgal meal as a dietary ingredient in formulated diets to improve the feeding activity, health and marketability of abalone in commercial production.",10.1111/raq.12085

This is a first investigation of the effect of added proline to standard abalone feed, on the metabolite profile of slow-growing abalone. A targeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics research approach was followed to recognise the metabolic response of abalone showing slower growth performance. The addition of proline to the standard abalone diet was found to serve as a substrate for amino acid catabolism in slower growing abalone, by means of proline breakdown to assist with energy production via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Other amino acids and urea cycle intermediates, that is, arginine, asparagine, ornithine and creatine further support energy production via the action of protein catabolism in slow-growing abalone. Additionally, the importance of understanding how abalone respond metabolically to modified feed highlights the use of metabolomics to answer abalone aquaculture farming questions.",10.1111/are.13978

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of four different macroalgae (Gracilaria tenuistipitata, Laminaria japonica, Gelidium japonica, and Sargassum sp.) on the feed intake and feeding rate of juvenile Haliotis asinina Linnaeus (H. asinina), and the effect of these macroalgae on abalone food choice as single or combined diets. juveniles of H. asinina with mean initial weight and shell length of 5.2 +/- 0.9 g and 24.2 +/- 0.7 mm, respectively, were selected, and the experiments lasted for approximately 100 days. In trial 1, there were four treatments, and each supplied with a single macroalgal species with 24 h fasting; in trial 2, all four macroalgal species were supplied together with 24h fasting; in trial 3, the juveniles were fasted for an additional 24 h before supplying a single diet to explore the effect of the fasting; and in trial 4, different combinations of macroalgae were supplied as diet for biological evaluation of factors, including daily rate of shell increase, weight growth rate, specific growth rate, and feed conversion efficiency. Comparison of different feed intakes, feeding rates, and selection rates suggested that H. asinina juveniles showed different feeding preferences for the different macroalgae. The most consumed diet was G. japonica (red algae), followed by G. tenuistipitata (red algae), and L. japonica (brown algae), and finally, Sargassum sp. (brown algae).

In this 91-d study we investigated the effects of feeding four diets containing graded levels of crude protein (CP; 27, 30, 33 and 36%) at three seasonal water temperatures (14, 17 and 20 degrees C) on the energy budget components for 6-month-old Greenlip Abalone, Haliotis laevigata, (0.91 g; 19.46 mm shell length). The increase of water temperature significantly increased individual energy budget components, rates for somatic growth energy, respiration energy and shell growth energy of abalone. Ammonia excretion energy rate was positively related to increasing dietary CP levels. In contrast, there were significant interactions between water temperature and dietary CP levels for ingested feed energy rate, absorbed energy rate and egested faecal energy rate. For energy budgets, respiration energy accounted for the largest proportion and ranged between 34.1 and 43.9% of the ingested feed energy. Somatic growth energy (16.80-28.10%) also accounted for a large proportion of the energy budget. Although egested faecal energy was lower, it still accounted for 8.2-17.9% of the ingested feed energy. In contrast, pedal mucus production energy (4.12-6.20%), ammonia excretion energy (0.28-1.40%) and shell growth energy (0.22-0.46%) accounted for relatively smaller proportions of ingested feed energy. Water temperature significantly impacted energy budgets more than dietary CP level. To maximise energy transfer to somatic growth, a water temperature of 20 degrees C is recommended for culturing Greenlip Abalone. Additionally, to minimise energy loss through faecal egestion, a dietary CP level of 36% is recommended for the diet of 6-month-old Greenlip Abalone at optimum water temperatures. However, the increase in ammonia excretion energy at high dietary CP should also be considered when managing water quality and waste production in abalone farms, especially where tank water exchange is limited. These findings provide a better understanding of the energy budgets for Greenlip Abalone, in relation to temperature and dietary protein levels, and will aid in the development of sustainable diets applicable to the three-four years of culture.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.736499

First, a pebble coated with crustose coralline algae (CCA) was used to induce competent H. diversicolor larvae to metamorphose at 2, 5,8,12, or 17 days (Group A) or 2,6, 10, or 12 days (Group B) after fertilization. To observe spontaneous attachment and metamorphosis, some larvae from Group B were maintained without the addition of a CCA-coated pebble. Rapid metamorphosis was observed in older larvae of both CCA-induced groups; 2 days after the addition of the CCA-coated pebble, 50-75% of the 2-day-old larvae and more than 85% of the 5-12-day-old larvae had metamorphosed. The percentage of spontaneously metamorphosed individuals increased 14 days after fertilization, reaching 50.6 +/- 16.7% (mean +/- S.E.) at 18 days. Second, metamorphosed post-larvae that had experienced larval periods of 5, 8, 11, or 15 days (Group A) or 4, 7, or 10 days (Group B) were reared at 26 degrees C with or without the benthic diatom Nitzchia ovalis as the sole food source. The survival and growth rates of the fed post-larvae in both groups decreased with the length of the larval swimming period; of the post-larvae from larvae of more than 7-11 days old, fewer than 70% still survived 16 days after metamorphosis. Mean growth rates during the 6 days after metamorphosis were lowest for the post-larvae from the larvae with the longest period of swimming. Third, newly settled post-larvae from 2-day-old larvae were reared at 26 degrees C with delays of 0, 3,6,9, or 12 days before first feeding (N. ovalis). Feeding delays of longer than 6 days dramatically depressed post-larval survival rates: approximately I week after the onset of feeding, more than 65% and fewer than 20% of the larvae subjected to feeding delays of 0-3 days or 6-12 days, respectively, still survived. These results indicate that H. diversicolor is more susceptible to the detrimental effects of delayed metamorphosis and delayed post-settlement feeding than are the larger abalone species Haliotis discus hannai and Haliotis iris.

Here, we investigated the potential for a deposit-feeding sea cucumber, Holothuria scabra, to provide a remediation service whilst concurrently yielding a high-value secondary product in a land-based recirculating aquaculture system (RAS). The effect of sediment depth, particle size and redox regime were examined in relation to changes in the behaviour, growth and biochemical composition of juvenile sea cucumbers cultured for 81 d in manipulated sediment systems, describing either fully oxic or stratified (oxic-anoxic) redox regimes. The redox regime was the principal factor affecting growth, biochemical composition and behaviour, while substrate depth and particle size did not significantly affect growth rate or biomass production. Animals cultured under fully oxic conditions exhibited negative growth and had higher lipid and carbohydrate contents, potentially due to compensatory feeding in response to higher micro phyto benthic production. In contrast, animals in the stratified treatments spent more time feeding, generated faster growth and produced significantly higher biomass yields (626.89 +/- 35.44 g m(-2) versus 449.22 +/- 14.24 g m(-2); mean +/- SE). Further, unlike in oxic treatments, growth in the stratified treatments did not reach maximum biomass carrying capacity, indicating that stratified sediment is more suitable for culturing sea cucumbers.

Results showed that weight gain and specific growth rate of abalone fed the CBM0 (185.4 +/- 12.83% and 0.93 +/- 0.040%/day, respectively) diet were significantly (p < 0.04 for both) higher than those of abalone fed the CBM100 (139.0 +/- 6.36% and 0.78 +/- 0.024%/day, respectively) diet. Shell length and width of abalone fed the CBM0 diet were significantly (p < 0.003 and p < 0.02, respectively) longer and wider than those of abalone fed the CBM75 and CBM100 diets. Survival of abalone during the 7-day postobservation period after the 24-h air exposure exhibited no remarkable (p > 0.1 for Log Rank and Wilcoxon tests) difference among all formulated diets according to the analysis of the Kaplan-Meier survival curve. In conclusion, CBM can replace FMup to 50% in an abalone diet without compromising growth performance and survival.",10.1111/jwas.12973

Biochemical composition (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, ashes) of algae was measured. No mortality was observed during the time of the experiment in any of the treatments. Growth in length and weight was higher for abalone fed with P. palmata and the mixed diet. Abalone exhibited a preference for P. palmata and showed the highest weight gain with this macroalgae (107.8 +/- 7.2 %). Grateloupia turuturu disintegrated faster in abalone rearing conditions and was not suitable for significant growth of H. tuberculata in a monospecific diet. However, when it is provided in a mixed diet, abalone seem to show a higher lipid content than when fed a P. palmata monospecific diet.

For example, the loss of the native main food, Macrocystis pyrifera, and the subsequent takeover of non-indigenous algae species represent a major threat to abalone growth and survival. In Baja California, Mexico two introduced macroalgae, Undaria pinnatifida and Sargassum horneri have become common in the past decade with unknown consequences on native herbivores. In this work, we explored the effect of these invasive algae on the growth and survival of juvenile red abalone, Haliotis rufescens. One hundred and ten juvenile red abalone were tagged and fed with invasive algae U. pinnatifida and S. horneri, and a control with M. pyrifera. Then, the shell length, body weight, and survivorship were assessed monthly for 90 days. Results show that abalone fed U. pinnatifida had a total growth in length, weight, and survivorship, similar to those fed native M. pyrifera. In contrast, abalone fed S. horneri had significantly lower overall performance. Marine heatwaves and other climatic impacts are expected to favour the establishment of invasive species.

"Lin, SH; Gao, XL; Zhang, M; Lyu, M; Ke, CH",Feeding strategy trade-off and selection of marine nocturnal gastropods under predation risk,2022,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,9,,,,1015076,"The circadian rhythm is one of the most crucial and universal biological rhythms in living organisms. As a typical nocturnal creature, the Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) exhibits rhythmic behaviors in terms of passively selecting whether to avoid predators or to forage, and active adaptation to light cycle changes is regulated by the biological clock. However, no basic data are available to help us to understand these rhythmic behaviors in the abalone species. In the present study, quantification of behavioral data for the abalone and its predator swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus in short-term (24 h) and long-term (40 days) polyculture scenarios suggests that the distance and duration of movement, percentage of feeding individuals, and cumulative duration of feeding of the abalone individuals were significantly lower under the short-term predation risk than the long-term predation risk. The concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), protein kinase A (PKA), and hexokinase (HK) in hemolymph, and expression levels of 5-HT1A receptor and 5-HT2 receptor in cerebral ganglion were significantly higher under the long-term predation risk than the short-term predation risk. The concentration of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glycogen content in adductor muscle of the abalone was significantly higher under the short-term predation risk than the long-term predation risk, thereby implying their role in anaerobic metabolism and aerobic metabolism as primary energy sources under the short-term and long-term predation risk, respectively. The concentrations of 5-HT and cAMP, and the expression levels of Bmal1 and 5-HT2 receptor exhibited no significant signs of cosine rhythmicity under the short-term predation risk, but changes in the movement and feeding behaviors of the abalone still occurred at the night only. Correlation analysis shows that the expression levels of Bmal1 and Clock had significantly positive correlations with the circadian changes in the movement parameters of the abalone, thereby suggesting a dominant role in the rhythmic expression of endogenous circadian clock genes regulating the rhythmic behavior of the abalone. These findings provide new insights into the origin and evolution of biological rhythms in nocturnal marine animals and a reference for developing rational stock enhancement plans, and would improve protection for marine benthic biodiversity.",10.3389/fmars.2022.1015076

Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the E-test. Genes encoding antimicrobial resistance and invasiveness factors were examined by PCR. A total of 27 strains were obtained from 326 mastitis milk samples. Streptococcus parauberis isolates (n=11) showed high resistance to erythromycin (90.9%), followed by tetracycline (45.5%), chloramphenicol (36.4%) and clindamycin (27.3%). Streptococcus uberis isolates (n=16) were highly resistant to tetracycline (81.3%) and clindamycin (62.5%). Both species were susceptible to ampicillin. The most prevalent resistance gene in S. uberis was tetM (80.0%), followed by blaZ (62.5%) and ermB (62.5%). However, tetM, blaZ, and ermB genes were only found in 27.3, 45.5, and 27.3%, respectively, of S. parauberis. In addition, all of the isolates carried at least one selected virulence-related gene. The most prevalent virulence-associated gene pattern in the current study was sua+pauA/skc+gapC+hasC detected in 22.2% of the strains. One S. uberis strain carried 7 virulence-associated genes and belonged to the sua+pauA/skc+gapC+cfu+hasA+hasB+hasC pattern. More than 59.3% of analysed strains carried 4 to 7 virulence-related genes. Our findings demonstrated that S. parauberis and S. uberis isolated from clinical bovine mastitis cases in China exhibited diverse molecular ecology, and that the strains were highly resistant to antibiotics commonly used in the dairy cow industry.

Anti-Vibrio IgY was alginate encapsulated in egg powders as feed, which may avoid antibody inactivation in the gastrointestinal tract of small abalone. The feed was tested for the stability of anti-Vibrio IgY in a gastrointestinal mimic environment. The result showed anti-Vibrio IgY retained activity as high as 90% after 4 h exposure to pancreatic enzymes.

At settlement, two plate conditioning times for the green alga Ulvella lens (conditioned for 6 or 8 wk) were evaluated and compared with plates colonized by different diatom species (Navicula cf. jeffreyi and Cocconeis sp.). In a choice experiment an overall settlement rate of 87% was estimated 3 days after larval release. The majority of the larvae chose to settle on U. lens (61% on 8-wk-old and 14% on 6-wk-old U. lens, with average algal cover of 97% and 82% respectively). Larvae showed a clear preference for older than for younger U. lens, with similar percentage cover. indicating that the developmental stage of the alga and not percentage cover per se is important in settlement induction. Only 7% and 5% respectively of the settled larvae were found on the plates colonized by the diatom species N. cf. jeffreyi and Cocconeis sp. Results clearly demonstrate that U. lens provides a suitable substrate to improve the settlement of Haliotis laevigata larvae on commercial scale. Juvenile growth (mu m day(-1)) oil a mixed diet of U. lens and N. c jeffreyi was not constant and increased with size to 70-80 mu m day(-1). Both growth rate and size variability increased over time until juveniles reached approximately 5 mm in shell length. The survival declined to ca. 30% at 44 days after settlement but stabilized thereafter. Distinct increases in size variability were observed between 3 and 16 and between 30 and 44 days after settlement. followed by elevated growth rates and a change from monomodal to multimodal distribution at day 44. The latter coincided with a shift in diet from a diatom-dominated diet to a macroalgal diet of U. lens at day 44. The increase in growth rate between 3 and 16 days is believed to reflect a shift in nutrition with postlarvae switching from absorbing yolk reserves to efficient exogenous feeding. The growth. Survival, and size variability of juveniles was assessed when feeding on algal diets as well as a formulated diet. Juveniles grew faster on U. lens than on a formulated feed or plates colonized with the diatom N. cf. jeffreyi. Results indicate that growth Of juveniles may be more variable when feeding on natural feed (Navicula cf jeffreyi., U. lens) than on a formulated feed. However, until a feed is formulated that can match the mean growth rates achieved on U. lens, we suggest keeping juveniles on plates colonized with U. lens as long as possible. Juvenile H. laevigata should not he weaned onto formulated feed until they reach at least 5 mm in shell length.",

Little consideration has been given to the effects of fluctuating water temperatures and dietary protein levels on the morphology of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of abalone. Because these factors are known to impact growth in other aquatic species, it is important that they are investigated further to improve growth in abalone species. In this study, the histological changes of the GIT of greenlip abalone in response to 2 water temperatures and 4 dietary levels of crude protein (juvenile, 27% and 36%; subadult, 24% and 33%) for juveniles (1.75 g) and subadults (22.93 g) were investigated.

Field observations showed that all juvenile abalone remained concealed under urchins by day. Even by night, only 10-25% left the protection of urchins to forage. Offered a choice of rocks or urchins in tide pools, the juveniles strongly preferred urchins rather than rocks. In aquaria, both urchins and abalone were active only at night. The frequency with which juvenile abalone left shelter was greatest if rocks constituted the only form of concealment, intermediate when they sheltered under urchins alone and least when the urchins had access to drift kelp. The treatment that provided abalone with both urchins and drift kelp had the lowest rate of urchin movement and the highest microalgal benthic standing stocks, the gut contents of the abalone comprised mainly kelp and their gut fullness indices were higher than in the other treatments. Concealment of juvenile abalone beneath urchins evidently provides them with several benefits. First, when urchins trap drift kelp, the abalone are capable of feeding on it and enhance their uptake of food. Second, this behaviour reduces the frequency with which juvenile abalone leave the shelter of urchins. Third, urchins that trap drift kelp reduce their rates of movement and their consumption of benthic microalgae, and we speculate that this may improve feeding conditions for the early postsettlement recruit stages of H. midae, and reduce the risk of urchins bulldozing them. Thus, for a complex of reasons, the dependency of R angulosus on drift kelp provides benefits to abalone that would not exist if this urchin acted as a conventional grazer.

The growth efficiencies of abalone show a negative relationship with the levels of dietary lipid and a positive relationship with the protein contents. These results suggest that fouling macroalgae have a great potential to be used as diets of abalone.",10.1111/j.1365-2109.2009.02478.x

The 250, 500, 750 and 1,000 g/kg U. pinnatifida were substituted with the equal amount of CPB, referred to as the CPB250, CPB500, CPB750 and CPB1000 diets, respectively. Finally, dry U. pinnatifida was prepared. Abalone were fed for 16 weeks and then subjected to air exposure stressor for 24 hr. The cumulative mortality of abalone was monitored for the following 4 days after 24-hr air exposure. Survival, weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone fed all formulated diets were greater than those of abalone fed the U. pinnatifida. The greatest weight gain and SGR were achieved in abalone fed the CPB500 diet. The chemical composition of the soft body of abalone was not affected by the experimental diets. Higher cumulative mortality was observed in abalone fed the CPB0 and dry U. pinnatifida at 16 hr after 24-hr air exposure compared to abalone fed all other diets. In conclusion, U. pinnatifida could be completely substituted with CPB in abalone feed.",10.1111/anu.13009

Because foot and adductor muscle texture and flavor affect economic value, we sought evidence of differences attributable to wave action among populations of the commercial New Zealand abalone, Haliotis in's. Evidence of environmentally induced changes were not found for condition indices relating shell and soft body proportions; muscle composition, such as total protein, collagen or water content; muscle biochemistry, such as intracellular pH buffering capacity, adenylate content, homarine or inositol monophosphate (IMP) content; blood hemocyanin concentration and muscle RNA content indicative of protein synthesis and somatic growth rates. The major difference in muscles of animals from exposed sites were higher activities of the glycolytic pyruvate reductase enzyme, tauropine dehydrogenase, and lower glycogen content. The differences imply that abalone exposed to heavy wave action routinely depend on bouts of anaerobic muscle work associated with attachment and locomotion but that the absence of wave action in aquacultural practice may not adversely affect muscle properties.

It is essential, therefore, that aquaculture investment includes genetics and biotechnology to adapt marine livestock to the novel conditions of intensive aquaculture and to the demanding markets into which they are sold. The return on investment in well-structured breeding programmes can be very high, and significant performance and economic gains have been demonstrated in multiple species. Many factors must be considered in designing a genetic improvement programme, including the reproductive biology of the species and the identification of realistic and commercially relevant breeding goals based on the resources and facilities available.

In aquatic ecosystems, certain fish and shellfish experience prolonged and short-term starvation stress, particularly during periods of extreme weather in the wild and inadequate feeding practices in aquaculture systems. Nutritional deficiencies caused by either short-term or prolonged starvation can lead to stress-induced health issues in fish and shellfish. Our study aimed to assess the impact of repeated short-term fasting and refeeding on immunological parameters and growth performance in the disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus. Abalones were randomly assigned to three distinct feeding patterns, with three replicates per group: Group I underwent continuous feeding for 35 days (CF), Group II experienced a repetitive cycle of 3-day fasting and 4-day refeeding for 35 days (PF) and Group III underwent no feeding for a 35-day period (NF). We measured survival and growth rate as well as analysed immunological parameters, such as total haemocyte count, phenoloxidase activity, respiratory burst activity, lysozyme activity and protein content across the groups. The results indicated that different feeding treatments impacted these immune responses differently across groups. Specifically, the group exposed to NF experienced a significant reduction in total haemocyte count (THC), respiratory burst activity and protein concentration, whereas phenoloxidase activity and lysozyme activity were highest in this group. The CF group showed no significant changes in respiratory burst activity, protein content, phenoloxidase activity and lysozyme activity. In contrast, the cycling short-term fasting and refeeding (PF) group exhibited higher lysozyme and phenoloxidase activities but had a lower THC. No differences were observed for respiratory burst activity and protein content in this group.

Rainbow trout silage oil was prepared from farmed rainbow trout processing waste, included at 25 g kg(-1) in a formulated diet and compared to a control diet in a 153 day growth trial. It was found that rainbow trout silage oil addition significantly improved abalone cellular immune function by increasing hemocyte phagocytic activity from 48.8% in the control diet to 65.2% in the silage oil diet. However, production performance was negatively impacted: specific growth rate (SGR) and final animal weight were decreased 17% and 5.6% respectively, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) increased by 25.1%. Foot muscle fatty acid profile and proximate composition were unaffected.

In the second change, when the shell length (SL) reached values of about 0.6-0.8 mm, post-larvae were able to digest diatom diets and they grew more rapidly oil efficiently digested strains. The final change consisted of a shift from a biofilm-dominated diet to a macroalgal-dominated diet. Post-larval abalone (> 1.8 mm SL) were able to utilize juvenile macroalgae efficiently.

To deal with this issue anti-biotics are a widely-preferred control strategy, but one that poses risks to the environment and humans, if used indiscriminately. In pursuit of an alternative, probiotics have emerged recently among viable alternatives for health management in aquaculture. The prophylactic use of probiotics in farmed shellfish species, i.e., shrimp, prawn, crab, crayfish, oyster and abalone, has been demonstrated to enhance production, promote the host internal microbiota, resulting in reduced incidence of bacterial, parasitic and even viral (e.g., White Spot Syn-drome Virus/WSSV, Yellowhead disease/YHD) diseases. Probiotics can be administered either as feed supple-ments or directly into rearing water, the former being generally more effective. Although precise modes of action are unknown, probiotics can deliver some measure of sustainability to shellfish aquaculture in multiple ways, including contributions to pathogen exclusion, better growth, survival and feed utilization, and immune mod-ulation. Antiviral mechanisms of probiotics are not well documented, but certain protobionts such as Bacillus and Lactobacillus have been effective in developing disease resistance and in reducing the prevalence of WSSV and YHD in a number of studies.

Four diets: abalone waste, fermented algae (sea lettuce Ulva lacinulata) mixed with sand (U+S), abalone pelleted feed, and sand, were fed to N. grammatus under controlled conditions for 6 wk. Sea cucumbers fed sand exhibited a significantly higher (p < 0.001) ingestion rate (1.35 +/- 0.04 g ind..-1 d-1) than other diets. Those fed U+S (1.03 +/- 0.02 g ind..-1 d-1) had a significantly higher ingestion rate (p < 0.001) than those fed abalone waste and pellet.

In a second experiment, the influence of inclusion level of a feed ingredient (soybean meal) on apparent dry matter, organic matter, energy and protein digestibility was evaluated. Apparent protein digestibility coefficients exceeding 100% were found for sunflower meal and canola meal included into a reference diet. This also occurred when evaluating different inclusion levels of soybean meal into a fish meal reference diet, eliminating the opportunity to test the influence of inclusion level of soybean meal on apparent nutrient digestibility. Associative effects between different feed ingredients, diet and faecal nutrient leaching and mathematical artifacts in calculations when using substitution vs. single protein diets might have an influence on final apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) of highly digestible feed ingredients. It was found that apparent protein digestibility coefficients determined with single protein diets predicted determined digestibility in compound diets with an error of less than 3.3% compared to a deviation of 13% to 16% when using coefficients determined with substitution trials. The conclusion from this study is that single protein diets should be used for determining apparent protein digestibility coefficients of feed ingredients for H. midae when evaluating feed ingredients for feed composition tables.

The minimal nutrient concentration resulting in significant enrichment of U. rigida was 2.25 mg N l(-1). The maximum nitrogen content obtained by U. rigida in this study was 6.099%, which resulted from an inorganic nutrient concentration of 7 mg N l(-1). However, no further significant increase in enrichment occurred from nutrient concentrations of 10 and 15 mg N l(-1). Abalone specific growth rate in shell length (SGR(L)) and wet weight (SGR(W)) and foot muscle yield were significantly higher for abalone fed the artificial diet compared to those fed any U. rigida diet. Abalone fed U. rigida enriched in less than 15 mg N l(-1) had similar growth rates compared to abalone fed unenriched U. rigida. Abalone fed the artificial diet contributed a higher percentage of weight gain into the valuable foot muscle. The foot muscle moisture content of abalone fed the artificial diet was significantly lower than that of abalone fed any U. rigida diet. The conclusions reached by this study should assist Australian abalone producers in assessing the potential benefits of using U. rigida as an effluent biofilter and subsequent food source for the commercially important juvenile greenlip abalone.",10.1023/B:AQUI.0000042138.14961.c2

However, studies on the use of RP on aquatic animal species are limited. This study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with RP formulation on the growth, non-specific immunity, and disease resistance of juvenile ivory shells (Babylonia areolata). The experiment was conducted for 8 weeks, with B. areolata fed a control diet (RP0) and four diets containing four different RP formulations, with doses of 1 (RP1), 5 (RP2), 10 (RP3), and 20 (RP4) g/kg, respectively. Higher levels of R. palustris in the formulation led to increased final weight, weight gain, and specific growth rate in B. areolata. The crude protein content was significantly higher in the RP4 group compared to the RP0 group. However, there was no significant difference in the crude lipid content. Higher levels of R. palustris in the RP4 formulation group increased the trypsin and lipase activities. Dietary supplementation with RP significantly increased the total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities and decreased the malondialdehyde content in B. areolata. Acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase activities were significantly increased in the RP4 group compared to the RP0 group. Dietary RP significantly increased the expression levels of antioxidant-related (superoxide dismutase, Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase A-like, ferritin) and immune-related (acid phosphatase, cytochrome c) genes. Higher levels of R. palustris in the formulations RP3 and RP4 increased the survival rate of B. areolata challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus. These findings indicate that R. palustris preparation could improve growth performance, muscle composition, and digestive capacity and may act as an immune booster for preventing disease in B. areolata.",10.3390/fishes9120522

Six isonitrogenous and isoenergetic experimental diets (43% crude protein and 15.46 kJ/g diet) using Pollack fish oil as the lipid source, were formulated to contain six lipid levels (1.83, 3.83, 5.91,7.80, 9.76 and 11.73% dry diet, respectively). Triplicate groups of 50 shells (average weight 160.50 +/- 1.20 mg) were stocked in 120-1 tanks and fed to apparent satiation twice daily for 10 weeks. The results showed that growth performance and feed utilization were significantly affected by dietary lipid levels (P < 0.05). Maximum weight gain, mean protein gain and specific growth rate occurred at 5.91% dietary lipid level (P < 0.05), soft body to shell ratios were not significantly difference above 3.83% dietary lipid level, and there were no significant differences (P < 0.05) in survival of ivory shell fed the experimental diets. There were significant difference in protein, lipid, moisture and ash content in soft body (P < 0.05). Lipid content in soft body positively correlated with dietary lipid level, however, protein and ash content in soft body significantly decreased with the increase in dietary lipid level. Pepsin activity in soft body significantly increased with dietary lipid level increasing from 1.83 to 7.80%, and trypsinlike enzyme activity significantly increased with increase in dietary lipid level from 1.83 to 5.91%. However, lipase activity in soft body increased with an increase in dietary lipid level, but amylase activity was not significantly affected by the dietary lipid level. The results of this trial indicated that dietary lipid levels above 7.80% dry matter did not improve growth performance or feed utilization of juvenile ivory shell. Quadratic regression analysis of mean protein gain against dietary lipid level indicated that the optimal dietary lipid requirement for maximum mean protein gain of juvenile ivory shell is about 6.54% of dry diet.

Although there are numerous studies on abalone nutrition, most tend to focus on animal growth and nutrient utilization. A more holistic research approach to ensure a sustainable future for this industry will require the development of feeds that provide integrated nutrition and health benefits. In this review, we aim to synthesize the most recent scientific literature on the nutritional and health benefits and shortcomings of two main abalone feeding approaches (seaweed and formulated feeds) within aquaculture production practices.

Chemical defenses were examined by quantifying the amount of polyphenols, whereas the mechanical defenses were examined by measuring surface toughness. The algae tested were Ecklonia maxima, Laminaria pallida, and Porphyra capensis. The results showed that E. maxima was the most defended and of intermediate food value, L. pallida was poorly defended and of low food value, and P. capensis had almost no defenses and was of the highest food value. Abalone preferred P. capensis to either of the other two algae. Food preference was influenced by the diet on which the animals had been fed before the experiment. The influence of plant defenses on food preferences was not consistent between experiments or, in some instances, as plant defense theory may have predicted. Results showed that food value, plant defenses, and prior diet interacted to determine the food selectivity of juvenile abalone but that food value was of the greatest importance.",

Performance relates directly to the nutritional value of algae - or any feedstock - which in turn is driven by the amino acid content and profile, and specifically the content of the limiting essential amino acids. However, the relationship between feeding preferences, consumption and amino acid content of algae have rarely been simultaneously investigated for abalone, and never for the emerging target species Haliotis asinina. Here we found that the tropical H. asinina had strong and consistent preferences for the red alga Hypnea pannosa and the green alga Ulva flexuosa, but no overarching relationship between protein content (sum of amino acids) and preference existed. For example, preferred Hypnea and Ulva had distinctly different protein contents (12.64 vs. 2.99 g 100 g(-1)) and the protein-rich Asparagopsis taxiformis (>15 g 100 g(-1) of dry weight) was one of the least preferred algae. The limiting amino acid in all algae was methionine, followed by histidine or lysine. Furthermore we demonstrated that preferences can largely be removed using carrageenan as a binder for dried alga, most likely acting as a feeding attractant or stimulant. The apparent decoupling between feeding preference and algal nutritive values may be due to a trade off between nutritive values and grazing deterrence associated with physical and chemical properties.",10.1371/journal.pone.0038857

Digestion efficiencies of abalone fed on the nine diatom species were also measured. All abalone showed active feeding behaviour and diatom cells were observed in their stomachs. However, the growth rates of abalone fed on four diatom species, which were readily digested, were higher than those of abalone fed on the other five species of diatom. The cell walls of the former four diatom species were easily broken open when they were grazed by abalone because of their high adhesive strength (three species), or due to the weakly silicified cell walls (one species with a low adhesive strength). The other five species, whose adhesive strengths are low, were easily ingested by abalone without any deformation of the cell walls and the majority of them were excreted whole and still alive. It is considered that post-larval abalone cannot digest diatom cell contents in their alimentary canal without first rupturing the cell wall with the radula. It is thought that the post-larvae which ingested the latter five diatom species could not readily absorb the diatom cell contents as the cell wall was intact and thus their growth rates were low.",10.1016/0022-0981(95)00099-2

Hybridization is an effective way of improving germplasm in aquaculture, as it often generates desirable traits in the hybrids, including increased disease resistance. This study analyzed the dynamic changes in several immune indexes, including the survival rate, total hemocyte count (THC), hemocyte mortality, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and hemolymphatic pathogenic bacteria content, in two parental populations, Thailand B. areolata (TT) and Hainan B. areolata (HH), and their reciprocal hybrids, Thailand B. areolata female x Hainan B. areolata male (TH) and Hainan B. areolata female x Thailand B. areolata male (HT), challenged with Vibrio harveyi, the main pathogenic bacterial species affecting B. areolata. The results showed that the median lethal concentrations (LC50) of the four populations were in the order HH-LC50 > TT-LC50 and TH-LC50, and HT-LC50 > TT-LC50 at 48 and 72 h post challenge. The changes in non-specific immune parameters showed that under control conditions, HT had a higher THC than the other three populations and that it maintained this level throughout the infection process, while HH and HT showed significantly lower hemocyte mortality rates and higher ROS levels than TT and TH. In addition, the pathogenic Vibrio (V. harveyi) count in the hemolymph of the four populations increased sharply to a peak value and then slowly decreased after infection. Compared with the control groups, the change rates of the cumulative total pathogen content in the hemolymph were in the order TT > TH > HH > HT at 72 h after infection, indicating that HT suppressed and eliminated pathogenic microorganisms most effectively. HT may have inherited the more efficient non-specific immune function from HH. Overall, the results suggest that TT may be more susceptible to V. harveyi infection than HH, and hybridization could be a useful way to improve the disease resistance of the ivory shell, thereby benefiting the aquaculture industry.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.740646

Better growth for juveniles fed M. pyrifera or E. arborea was observed, and survival was higher for juveniles fed E. arborea. Cholesterol is either synthesized de novo, or transformed from other phytosterols in abalone; several phystosterols were associated with survival. Highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA), and particularly docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3 or DHA) were found in tissues of juveniles fed E. arborea, that did not contain these HUFA. DHA in muscle phospholipids and several bacteria biomarkers in digestive gland (15:0, 17:0, and branched fatty acids) were negatively associated with growth. Survival was associated with 16:2n-4, a biomarker for diatoms, and iso18:0 a biomarker for mainly gut bacteria. Non-methylene interrupted fatty acids (NMI) were highest in abalone fed U. lactuca, in agreement with the capacity of molluscs to produce NMI when lacking HUFA.

However, the role of chemical defences in filamentous algae has received far less attention. We investigated possible chemical feeding deterrence by filamentous red algae that have conspicuous cellular inclusions (Asparagopsis armata, Anotrichium tenue and Balliella amphiglanda) and 2 others without inclusions (Callithamnion korfense and Ulva sp.). The 3 algae with cellular inclusions were consumed at lower rates by a generalist amphipod, Hyale nigra, than the other 2 algae. To determine the potential role of chemical defences for A. armata, we conducted tests against herbivores using algae in which the production of halogenated metabolites was manipulated. This manipulation had no effect on carbon and nitrogen values of the algae, and allowed us to directly test the role of algal secondary metabolites in defence against herbivores without using artificial diets. Bromide (+) algae (with halogenated metabolites) deterred grazing by 2 mesograzers (Hyale nigra and juvenile abalone Haliotis rubra), which consumed up to 4 times more bromide (-) (metabolite-free) algae than bromide (+) algae. Juveniles of the sea hare Aplysia parvula were not deterred by the chemical defences in bromide (+) A. armata. In field assays, artificial diets containing a crude extract of A. armata were also active against herbivores.

We compared the responses of unselected farmed and wild abalone to stressors that occur on farms. The aim was to determine if the farm environment had induced differences in the behavioural or physiological performances of the abalone. Thirty hatchery-born 3.5 year-old abalone and thirty wild ones were reared under standard farm conditions for 6 months and characterised for 19 traits related to growth, survival, behaviour and immunology. Behavioural and immunological responses to stressors differed between the two stocks. Farmed abalone retracted and swivelled less in reaction to a finger contact. Phagocytosis efficiency was reduced by shaking in abalone from both origins, but the farmed stock returned to the basal level after the recovery week, while wild abalone did not, and a rise of total haemocyte count after shaking and its return to a basal level after one week was only observed for the farmed stock. This indicates that both behaviour and immune responses following a stress have been affected by the farming practices. This suggests that a domestication process has already been initiated in the farmed stock.

Diets containing algal supplements have been suggested as pre-emptive solutions for preventing these mass mortalities. The same has also been suggested for diets containing grape seed extract. This is due to their potential as a source of antioxidative compounds, which reduce the accumulation of harmful reactive oxygen species. This study aimed to identify functional genes associated with high survival in abalone fed diets high in antioxidative compounds during heat stress. Tentacle transcriptomes of 40 greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) were investigated to determine the combined effects of differing diets and temperature on the gene expression responses by abalone.

Twenty-four genes were differentially expressed between high survival promoting diets (macroalgae or grape seed extract supplemented commercial) relative to the purely commercial diet. Many of these genes have been suggested to be involved in antioxidant and innate immunity responses. The identification of these genes and their functional roles has enhanced our understanding of processes that contribute to summer stress resilience in abalone.

However, with decreasing catches from the wild some fishermen's group may eventually resort to rearing tokobushi until of marketable size. Growth experiments of tokobushi fed macroalgae in floating net cage and plastic tanks were conducted to evaluate the influence of culture system, macroalgal food, age and water temperature on their culture. In floating net cage, marketable sizes were obtained at the age of 457-822-day old (15-27-month old) with highest growth rate of 2.36% g day(-1) and 0.21 mm day(-1). One advantage of the plastic tank culture system was that the tokobushi shell remained clean throughout the culture period. Macroalgal food affected the growth rate; Sargassum fusiforme (Setchell)- and Ulva pertusa (Kjellman)-fed tokobushi were better than Meristotheca papulosa (Montagne)-fed. Further, 1-year-old tokobushi had better growth performance and condition index than the 2-year-old cohort, and growth rates were higher at 17 degrees C than at 12 degrees C.

About 53,300 progeny representing 533 full-sib families from the mating between 308 sires and 533 dams were tested in concrete tanks for five generations. Breeding candidates in the base generation (G(0)) and first generation (G(1)) were selected based on their estimated breeding values for growth (recorded as shell length at tagging and harvest), while those in later generations (G(2)-G(3)) were selected according to a selection index including individual breeding values for growth and family breeding values for survival traits. Variance components and genetic parameters were estimated using animal models and the restricted maximum-likelihood method. The breeding values of all animals over five generations were estimated using the best linear unbiased prediction. Within generations, the heritability estimates for square root transformed tagging shell length and harvest shell length were moderate, ranging from 0.125 to 0.237 and from 0.196 to 0.308, respectively. Across generations, the heritability estimates for the two growth traits were relatively low; 0.109 and 0.169, respectively, and the heritability of survival was low (0.069), but suggestive of a significant additive genetic component. Including all data, the effects common to full-sibs other than additive genetic effects (c(2)) accounted for 5.1%, 2.6% and 3.1% of the total phenotypic variance for transformed tagging shell length, harvest shell length and survival traits, respectively, and the three values were significantly different from zero (P < 0.05). Genetic correlations of harvest shell length with tagging shell length and survival were favorable and significantly different from zero; 0.633 and 0.467, respectively. The predicted response was obtained from the difference in the mean breeding values between generations. When using the LS mean of the base population (G(0)) as a baseline for comparison, the average selection response of harvest shell length expressed as proportions ranged from 6.1% to 12.6%, with an average of 9.2%. The average estimated selection response per population for survival was 4.1%, and the accumulated selection response was 16.5% after performing four generations of selection. Based on these results, the breeding population had considerable additive genetic variation in growth traits, and the ongoing selective breeding program resulted in considerable genetic improvement in growth and survival in H. diversicolor.

Abalones (initial weight: 10.98 +/- 0.05 g) were fed with graded levels of dietary lipid, which were 15.73, 23.41, 31.72, 38.25, 46.35, 55.63, 61.70 and 67.19 g/kg. Results showed that compared with the treatment with 38.25 g/kg of dietary lipid, 67.19 g/kg of dietary lipid increased the cumulative mortality of abalone after a challenge with Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Meanwhile, 67.19 g/kg of dietary lipid decreased the activities of lysozyme (LZ) and acid phosphatase (ACP) in serum, and the mRNA levels of beta-defensin and mytimacin 6 in hepatopancreas of abalone. The mRNA levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf alpha), activator protein 1 (ap-1), nuclear factor kappa B (nf-kappa b), interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase-4 (irak4), myeloid differentiation primary response protein MyD88 (myd88), toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2), tlr4 and perilipin-2, and the protein level of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), TNF alpha, NF-kappa Bp65, AP-1, MyD88 and Perilipin-2 in hepatopancreas were up-regulated by 67.19 g/kg of dietary lipid. However, the mRNA levels of arginase and inhibitor of kappa B alpha (i kappa b alpha) were down-regulated. Besides, 67.19 g/kg of dietary lipid up-regulated the mRNA levels of executor apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase 3 (caspase-3), caspase-7 and B-cell lymphoma protein-2-associated X protein (bax), and the protein levels of caspase-3 and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) in hepatopancreas.

A rearing experiment was conducted for one week in which the feeding rate was examined daily, e.g., one, two and three h after feeding. At the conclusion of the experiment, overall growth was calculated, and enzymatic activity related to digestion, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase pertaining to antioxi-dant biomarkers, as well as expression levels of genes related to antioxidation and stress response, were examined. The results showed that the highest growth rates were observed in the yellow light group, while the lowest growth rates were found in the violet and blue light groups; on the other hand, no significant differences were found among the other groups. Meanwhile, when exposed to white, yellow, or green light, juveniles exhibited high feeding rates, while those in the violet and blue light groups showed low feeding rates. Regarding enzymatic activity related to digestion, those of alpha-amylase, lipase, pepsin, and trypsin were relatively higher in the yellow light group than in the other groups. Regarding oxidative stress, the yellow light group showed higher superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities than the other groups. In contrast, the lowest malonaldehyde level was found in the white light group, followed by yellow light, while there were no significant differences among the other groups. In addition, the expression levels of genes related to antioxidation and stress response (heat shock protein 70 and glucose-regulated protein 78) in juveniles generally exhibited higher levels in the red light group, whereas they showed relatively lower levels in the yellow light group.

The effect of diet on the gonad development of 27-month-old farmed Haliotis midae, raised at two stocking densities, was analysed. We fed two artificial diets and a natural diet, kelp, to cultured abalone. The first artificial diet had fishmeal as its main source of protein, while in the other, Abfeed (R) S34, 32% of the fish meal was replaced with soya meal. For each gonad sample, the development phase was determined based on both histological criteria and the gonad bulk index (GBIn).

The highest growth was observed for postlarvae fed the MIX (51.37 mu m day(-1) and 0.578 +/- 0.1 mg day(-1)), but was not significantly different from the NAV treatments (46.60 +/- 3.4 gm day(-1) and 0.550 +/- 0.1 mg day(-1)). Abalone larvae, which are lecithotrophic organisms, seem to utilize proteins as a preferred energy substrate up to metamorphosis, since the relative lipid content increased from 15 to 30% from days 0 to 10. Thereafter, lipids are rapidly utilized and decreased to a level of 2% of the dry matter in the postlarvae whole soft tissue. Tissue fatty acid analysis indicated a similar trend among treatments, where relative fatty acid levels increased during the endogenous feeding period and started to decrease concomitant with the start of the exogenous feeding. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, reported on abalone tissue showed a similar trend, among treatments. Based on the results reported here, it can be concluded that the type of diatom is an important factor for growth, where a high lipid and low ash content could be important to improve the performance in terms of growth and survival, in combination to stimulate protease activity and therefore better digestibility. Last but not the least important, the use of monoculture with NAV will be of importance when culturing abalone postlarvae. The estimated energy budget, back calculated from the digestibility figures, indicates that abalone requires from 25 to 38 cal day(-1) g abalone(-1) for adequate growth. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

At multiple locations, we examined the hypothesis that diversity and abundance in temperate reef fish assemblages were independent of bait type. We used 3 bait types (abalone viscera, pilchards and crushed urchin) and quantified commonly used metrics for the fish assemblage, including species richness, time of first arrival and relative abundance on 3 shallow rocky reefs in southeastern Australia over 2 yr. We distinguished the following 6 feeding guilds: herbivore, zooplanktivore, alga/invertebrate consumers, invertebrate carnivore, macroinvertebrate carnivore and generalist carnivore. The response of fishes was dependent on bait type, with urchin bait performing particularly poorly. Although we did not detect statistical differences between the performance of pilchards and abalone viscera as bait, pilchards produced more consistent outcomes. Importantly, we also observed strong spatial effects. In general, bait type had a marked effect on species richness, but little influence on relative abundance. Overall we conclude that oily bait such as pilchards, which have been widely used in most studies, yield the most consistent outcomes. Consequently, bait type and spatial variation in fish assemblages needs to be considered in sampling designs to assess the limitations of BRUVS.",10.3354/meps10137

Two polyculture stocking densities were employed, one in which each species was at the same density as in monoculture, for a combined density of 4.6 g shellfish per liter, and another in which the combined density was the same as for a single species in monoculture (approximately 2.3 g/L). All culture groups were fed at 3 levels: unfiltered seawater only, and unfiltered seawater plus 2 different quantities of benthic diatoms (0.25 or 0.50 g dry weight/week), phytoplankton (10 or 50 x 10(3) cells/mL), and diced shrimp (3 or 10% of prawn weight per day). Feeding rate and culture treatment produced a significant interactive effect on shellfish growth (ANOVA p < 0.001). Abalone growth was significantly greater in monoculture than in either the lower or higher density polyculture (mean individual weight increase = 0.48, 0.33 and 0.28 g, respectively). Likewise, prawn growth was significantly greater in monoculture than in either polyculture (0.72, 0.44 and 0.41, respectively). Growth increased significantly with amount of food supplied: mean abalone weight increased 0.15 g in the lowest feeding treatment vs 0.60 g in the highest, and mean prawn weight increased 0.21 g in the lowest feeding treatment vs 0.88 g in the highest. Mussel growth (0.04 g) was restricted by food availability at all feeding rates, and was not significantly affected by any experimental manipulations. Despite expected differences in feeding habits among the 3 species, abalone were found to be capable of ingesting and assimilating diced shrimp that was intended as food for prawns in the polyculture system. Sequential polyculture is proposed as an alternative to combined culture for pilot-scale applications.",

Diets were fed to replicate groups (n = 4) of ten juvenile greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) in 101 flow through aquaria for 61 days after a 21 day acclimation period. Absolute and specific growth rates were calculated for both shell length (SL) and whole wet body weight (BW). Dietary Ca supplementation did not significantly affect growth (P > 0.05), however the specific growth rate (BW) of animals fed diets supplemented with P was 7.9% higher than that of animals fed diets without P supplement (P < 0.05). There were no significant Ca x P interactions for growth indices (P > 0.05). Shell thickness was apparently unaffected by dietary Ca level. Mortality due to natural causes was not affected by diet (P > 0.05); the range was 0-7.5% (n = 8 treatments). The average feed conversion ratio (FCR; feed input per unit weight gain of wet abalone) for all diets was 1.19 (r: 0.93-1.4) when uncorrected for uneaten diet, and 0.90 (r: 0.80-0.96) when corrected. The apparent availability of CaCO3 was 65.6%. These results suggest that abalone do not require high levels of Ca in their diet (< 0.5%). Supplementation with CaCO3 is unnecessary, but P supplementation (greater than or equal to 0.7% total P) can improve growth rates. The Ca:P ratio of feed is not important within the range assessed (0.72:1 to 2.68:1). Further research on the effect of greater P supplementation on growth rate and the treatment of plant ingredients to liberate P bound by phytate is required.",10.1016/S0044-8486(96)01303-8

Deltamethrin (DM), a type II pyrethroid insecticide, has been widely detected in coastal and estuarine areas, while little attention has been given to the combined effects of DM and OA. In this study, Haliotis discus hannai was exposed to three pH levels (8.1, 7.7 and 7.4) and three DM nominal concentrations (0 mu g/L, 0.6 mu g/L and 6 mu g/L) for 14 and 28 days. The results indicated that experimental acidification and/or DM exposure led to impaired immune function and pathological damage. Additionally, acidified conditions and DM exposure induced oxidative stress, and gills are more sensitive than digestive glands. With increasing p CO 2 and DM nominal concentrations, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased, whereas catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities increased in the gills. Moreover, the expression levels of Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway-related genes were upregulated after exposure. Integrated biomarker response (IBR) analysis proved that acidified conditions and/or DM detrimentally affected the overall fitness of H. discus hannai, and co-exposure to experimental acidification and DM was the most stressful condition.

Live abalones sold in domestic markets are sealed in insulated containers for transportation over extended periods of time (6-24 h), during which this species may experience stressful conditions and spoil. This study assessed the survival rate and weight loss rate (WLR) of abalone under various treatments to determine the optimal packaging transport conditions. Specifically, temperature, supplemental humidity and oxygen, and air exposure during simulated live transport were investigated. Results revealed that the survival rate increased significantly after cold-water shock and humidity control, whereas oxygen supplements did not have a significant effect. In addition, WLR significantly increased over time (P < 0.05). An additional experiment was conducted to investigate the stress response caused by air exposure. Hemocyte parameters, including total hemocyte count (THC), hemocyte mortality, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), were estimated for 2, 6, 12, 24, and 30 h after air exposure at different temperatures. Results revealed that THC significantly decreased after 30 h of air exposure at 5 and 10 degrees C, and after 24 h of air exposure at 20 degrees C. Hemocyte mortality and ROS significantly increased, peaking after 30 h at 5 and 10 degrees C, followed by a gradual decrease over the subsequent 24 h recovery period.

Hence, the aim of the present work is to study the possibility of replacing kelp meal in the abalone diet with a regional winery by-product. Five diets were formulated in which kelp meal was substituted from 0% to 100%, at a maximum of 33% of the total of ingredients; 375 abalone (15.09 +/- 0.38 mm and 0.434 +/- 0.03 g) were used, randomly distributed in fifteen 8-L plastic buckets. After 60 days of experimentation, significant differences were detected in the slopes of the different treatments for both length and weight. Since the inclusion of the winery by-product resulted in a lower feed ingestion but the feed conversion efficiency remained constant, a factor of low palatability can be attributed to the winery by-product and not an antinutritional factor. It is concluded that the winery by-product can be substituted for kelp meal in 16% of the total diet without having a negative effect on the growth of the organisms.",10.7773/cm.v30i12.105

Abalone individuals were grouped into three developmental stages: small juveniles (<10 mm shell length (SL)), large juveniles (10-50 mm SL), and adults (>50 mm SL). The inferences of natural diets indicated that benthic diatoms, small red macroalgae and (or) juvenile brown macroalgae, and adult brown macroalgae were the primary food sources for small juveniles (6.5 +/- 1.0 min SL), large juveniles (23.7 +/- 6.1 mm SL), and adults (81.8 +/- 14.3 mm SL), respectively. The changes of delta(13)C in abalone were similar among three sampling stations and were explained by ontogenetic changes in feeding habits. The decrease of delta(13)C in abalone (<= 20 mm SL) indicated a transition from diatom feeding to juvenile brown macroalgae and (or) small red macroalgae feeding, whereas the subsequent increase of delta(13)C (>20 mm SL) represented a feeding transition to adult brown macroalgae.

After 2-month of rearing period, strawberry conches that were fed with these seaweeds showed high survival rate and high increase in body weight. The specific growth rate (SGR) of strawberry conch of U-D treatment was the highest, followed by L-D and E-D treatments, with significant differences observed among three treatments (P < 0.05). The histological measurements, such as intestinal fold height (hF) and fold width (wF), enterocyte height (hE) and microvillus height (hMV) of intestinal tissues in U-D and L-D treatments were not lower than that of wild group, however, these measurements were found to be significantly lower in E-D treatment (P < 0.05). Moreover, amylase, cellulase and lipase activities in strawberry conches fed with seaweeds were higher than that in wild group, whereas contrasting result was observed for pepsin activities (P < 0.05). The concentrations of all amino acids, except methionine, histidine, serine and proline, were significantly higher in wild strawberry conch compared to seaweed-feeding groups (P < 0.05).

Recent transcriptome analyses have revealed neuropeptide genes with potential roles in vertebrate and invertebrate growth and reproduction. Among these genes, haliotid growth-associated peptide (HGAP) was identified as a novel gene in abalone. Methods: This study focused on HGAP in Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), where the complete cDNA sequence named Hdh-HGAP was identified and characterized. Samples from different experiments, such as metamorphosis, juvenile abalone growth, gonad development stages, muscle remodeling, and starvation, were collected for mRNA expression analysis. Results: The sequence spans 552 bp, encoding 96 amino acids with a molecular weight of 10.96 kDa. Expression analysis revealed that Hdh-HGAP exhibited higher levels in muscle tissue. Notably, during metamorphosis, Hdh-HGAP exhibited greater expression in the trochophore, veliger, and juvenile stages than in the cell division stages. Regarding growth patterns, Hdh-HGAP was highly expressed during rapid growth compared to stunted, minimal, and normal growth. In gonadal development, Hdh-HGAP mRNA reached its highest expression level during the ripening stage, indicating a potential role in gonadal cell proliferation and maturation. The in vivo effects of GnRH on gonad development and the expression of the Hdh-HGAP neuropeptide indicate its involvement in regulating reproduction in Pacific abalone. While tissue remodeling is primarily governed by immune genes, Hdh-HGAP was also upregulated during muscle tissue remodeling. Conversely, Hdh-HGAP was downregulated during prolonged starvation. Conclusion: This study marks the first comprehensive exploration of the Hdh-HGAP neuropeptide gene in Pacific abalone, shedding light on its involvement in growth, reproduction, metamorphosis, tissue remodeling, and response to starvation, although regulatory mechanisms are mostly unknown.",10.1159/000535945

In highlighting the methodologies employed within this field, our current inability to understand the true ecological significance of any immune dysfunction caused by environmental stressors is outlined. Additionally, a number of examples are provided in which studies successfully demonstrate a measure of immunocompetence through alterations in disease resistance and organism survival to a realized pathogenic threat. Consequently, this review highlights the potential to advance our current understanding of the ecological and evolutionary significance of environmental stressor related immune dysfunction.

The results of this study agreed with those of previous studies, showing dulse to be of high nutritional quality for abalone, with a relatively high protein content when compared with other macroalgae. Specific growth rates (SGR) of abalone fed on all dulse diets were higher than those of abalone fed on kelp ( Nereocystis luetkeana). In general, abalone grew faster on dulse cultured with supplemental illumination. Protein content of dulse (10.85-18.22% dry wt.), however, was directly dependent on seawater volume exchange per day, with highest protein levels observed in dulse cultured with 35 volume exchanges d(-1).

A basal diet supplemented with 0.1-1.5 mg/kg PSP-SeNPs improved the growth performance of tilapia juveniles to a certain extent, increased the intestinal villus length, and significantly enhanced the activities of liver antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), and catalase (CAT). PSP-SeNPs also enhanced the resistance of tilapia to hypoxic stress and Streptococcus agalactiae infection, with supplementation at 0.1-0.3 mg/kg exerting more obvious effects than 1.5 mg/kg. However, PSP-SeNPs at a concentration of 4.5 mg/kg and Na2SeO3 at 0.3 mg/kg negatively affected the growth, gut health, and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes of tilapia. Quadric polynomial regression analysis revealed that 0.1-1.2 mg/kg was the optimal PSP-SeNP supplementation concentration for tilapia feeds. The findings of this study lay a foundation for the application of PSP-SeNPs in aquaculture.",10.1016/j.fsi.2023.108624

This study examines the impact of a 5 ? temperature increase over ambient conditions for six weeks on the metabolic rates, digestive enzyme activities in the digestive gland, and digestive efficiency of Red Abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and Paua (H. iris) on their natural diets. We test the hypothesis that abalone digestive function can keep pace with this increased metabolic demand in two separate experiments, one for each species. H. iris had higher food intake in the heat treatment. Both species had higher metabolic rates in the heat treatment with Q(10) = 1.73 and Q(10) = 2.46 for H. rufescens and H. iris, respectively. Apparent organic matter digestibility, protein digestibility, and carbohydrate digestibility did not differ between the heat treatment and the ambient (control) treatment in either experiment. H. rufescens exhibited higher maltase, alanine-aminopeptidase, and leucine-aminopeptidase activities in the heat treatment. Amylase, beta-glucosidase, trypsin, and alkaline phosphatase activities in the digestive gland tissue did not differ between temperature treatments. H. iris exhibited lower amylase and beta-glucosidase activities in the heat treatment, while maltase, trypsin, leucine-aminopeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase activities did not differ between treatments. We conclude that over six weeks of moderate heat stress both abalone species were able to maintain digestive function, but achieved this maintenance in species-specific ways.",10.1016/j.cbpa.2022.111230

However, the effects of dietary astaxanthin supplementation from different sources are still unknown. A comprehensive comparison of survival, growth, immune response, antioxidant activity, thermal resistance, disease resistance, and intestinal microbial structure was conducted in dietary antioxidant supplementation from the sources of Gracilaria lemaneiformis (GL), industrial synthetic astaxanthin (80 mg/kg astaxanthin actual weight, named as group 'SA80'), Phaffia rhodozyma (80 mg/kg astaxanthin actual weight, named as group 'PR80') and Haematococcus pluvialis (120 mg/kg astaxanthin actual weight, named as group 'HP120') at their optimal supplementation amounts. Furthermore, the SA80, PR80, and HP120 groups performed better in all aspects, including survival, growth, immune response, antioxidant activity, thermal resistance, and disease resistance, compared with the GL group. The PR80 and HP120 group also had a better growth performance than the SA80 group. In terms of heat stress and bacterial challenge, abalone in the PR80 group showed the strongest resistance. Overall, 80 mg/kg astaxanthin supplementation from Phaffia rhodozyma was recommended to obtain a more effective and comprehensive outcome. This study contributes to the discovery of the optimum dietary astaxanthin supplementation source for abalone, which is helpful to improve the production efficiency and economic benefits of abalone.

The amino acid compositions of 6 species of macroalgae (Ulva lactuca, Chondrus crispus, Palmaria palmata, Alaria esculenta, Laminaria digitata and Laminaria saccharina) and of the whole soft body of these abalone were determined and compared. The effects of these algal diets on the free amino acid (FAA) profiles inthe viscera and muscle of animals were investigated. To find a suitable index to evaluate the protein quality of natural diets for algivores, several indices were computed and correlated to the growth performance of abalone using correlation analysis. These two species of abalone have a very similar amino acid composition, indicating that they may have similar amino acid requirements. In all the selected algae, arginine may be the limiting amino acid, and in some instances methionine, threonine or histidine may be also limiting. Judging from the results of feeding test and amino acid analysis, P. palmata and A. esculenta seem to have the better amino acid pattern and availability among the selected algae. On the other hand, U. lactuca and C. crispus appear to be poor in their amino acid availability and/or pattern. Dietary treatments significantly affected the FAA profiles in animal tissues. The essential amino acid index (EAAI) and the degree of similarity (DS) of EAA patterns may not be applicable to evaluating the nutritional value of protein in natural feeds for the algivorous molluscs.

Six experimental diets were formulated containing 33.50 % of different carbohydrate sources including dextrin, pregelatinized wheat starch, wheat starch, tapioca starch, potato starch and corn starch. The diets were fed to the abalone with an initial weight of 3.42 f 0.02 g in triplicate tanks for 24 weeks, housed in a recirculation system, with seawater maintained at 18-20 degrees C. There were no significant differences detected in the average daily increment in shell length (DISL, mu m/day) or survival of abalone fed the six treatments containing different carbohydrate sources. However, there were significant differences detected in the average final weight and weight gain rate (WGR, %) parameters, with the lowest final weight (8.16 f 0.29 g) and WGR (140.38 f 6.57 %) observed in the potato starch fed abalone.

There was no significant difference found in the soft-tissue lipid content (5.84-6.87 %). The dextrin-based diet led to elevated plasma glucose (0.85 f 0.06 mmol/l) in abalone compared with the other treatment groups. The concentration of muscle glycogen in abalone fed with pregelatinized wheat starch showed the highest values with 78.45 f 1.53 mg/g tissue, which was significantly different to the other treatment groups, however, the digestive gland glycogen content (15.56-19.27 mg/g tissue) was maintained at a constant level regardless of the dietary carbohydrate sources.

Our study confirmed that carotenoids in abalones mainly come from diets, and the carotenoid types in the muscles were similar to their diets. We also found that feeding on G.lemaneiformis played an important role in maintaining a stable carotenoid content over time, especially zeaxanthin in H.gigantea. Our data also provided that abalones had a good growth performance under the feeding conditions of G.lemaneiformis. Finally, compared with common abalones, orange-muscle abalones had a notably enhanced ability to accumulate carotenoids through their diet, especially zeaxanthin (P < 0:01).

In this study, we identified and characterized an MT homolog from the disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus), referred to as disk abalone MT (AbMT). AbMT exhibited the same primary structural features as MTs from other mollusks containing two beta-domains (beta 2 beta 1-form). AbMT protein demonstrated metal-binding and detoxification abilities against Zn, Cu, and Cd, as evidenced by Escherichia coli growth kinetics, metal tolerance analysis, and UV absorption spectrum. Transcriptional analysis revealed that AbMT was ubiquitously expressed in all analyzed tissues and upregulated in gill tissue following challenge with Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes, and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). Additionally, overexpression of AbMT suppressed LPS-induced NO production in RAW264.7 macrophages, protected cells against H2O2-induced oxidative stress, and promoted macrophage polarization toward the M1 phase. Conclusively, these findings suggest an important role for AbMT in environmental stress protection and immune regulation in disk abalone.",10.1016/j.fsi.2024.109645

In this study, broodstock animals fed natural feeds and a mixed feeding regime had greater gonad and egg redness indices, possibly as a result of dietary carotenoids being incorporated into their gonads. These pigments have known antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, pro-vitamin A, photoprotection and immunity-related roles. Results from this study showed that a formulated feed (20U) should not be fed in isolation for reproductive purposes, as these broodstock animals displayed lower gonad and egg quality indices. Furthermore, this diet showed poor fatty acid provisioning, with an excess linoleic acid being detected in eggs. In contrast, animals fed a mixed diet displayed the most diverse egg fatty acid profile, with a high proportion of fatty acids commonly found in sea urchins, such as palmitic acid, myristic acid and the omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid. These results indicate that conditioning broodstock on natural feeds is advantageous for sea urchin gonad development and reproductive performance.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738035

This fatal disease for abalone is produced by a rickettsia-like organism (WS-RLO), the bacterium Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis. To evaluate the potential of the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) to improve its resistance to infection by WS-RLO, the additive genetic component in the variation of this trait was estimated. For this, the variation in infection intensity with WS-RLOs and WS-RLOv (phage-infected RLOs) was analyzed in 56 families of full-sibs maintained for three years in a host-parasite cohabitation aquaculture system. A WS-RLO prevalence of 65% was observed in the analysed population; and from the total WS-RLO inclusions 60% were hyperparasited with the phage (WS-RLOv). The decrease in the food ingestion rate was the sole negative effect associated with increasing WS-RLO intensity of infection, suggesting that the high level of WS-RLOv load may have diminished the symptoms of WS disease in the analyzed abalones. The estimated heritabilities were moderate to mid, but significant, varying from 0.21 to 0.23 and 0.36 for WS-RLO and WS-RLOv infections, respectively. This suggests that variation in resistance to infection with WS-RLO may respond to selection in the evaluated red abalone population. Estimated response to selection (G) for the level of infection by WS-RLO indicated that if the 10% of red abalone with the lowest infection level is selected as broodstock, a 90% reduction in the intensity of infection in the progeny can be expected, even with the lowest estimation of heritability (h(2) = 0.21). This strong response would be also due to the large phenotypic variance of this trait. Strong positive correlations, both phenotypic and genotypic, were observed between infection intensities with WS-RLO and WS-RLOv, indicating that selection to increase resistance to one of the types of RLOs will affect resistance in the other in the same direction. This is the first study that demonstrates the existence of additive genetic variation for resistance to WS-RLO in abalone. Consequently, it is possible to increase the resistance to WS-RLO in H. rufescens by selective breeding, which can be an economically attractive and environmentally friendly manner to reduce mortalities and growth effects caused by WS in abalone farms.",10.1016/j.jip.2017.08.014

MAPK1 is a member of the extracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERKs), playing roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and development. This is mainly in response to growth factors, mitogens, and many environmental stresses. In the current study, we have characterized the structural features of a homolog of MAPK1 from disk abalone (AbMAPK1). Further, we have unraveled its expressional kinetics against different experimental pathogenic infections or related chemical stimulants. AbMAPK1 harbors a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 23 bps, a coding sequence of 1104 bps, and a 3' UTR of 448 bp. The putative peptide comprises a predicted molecular mass of 42.2 kDa, with a theoretical pI of 6.28. Based on the in silica analysis, AbMAPK1 possesses two N-glycosylation sites, one S_TK catalytic domain, and a conserved His-Arg-Asp domain (HRD). In addition, a conservative glycine rich ATP phosphate -binding loop and a threonine-x-tyrosine motif (TEY) important for the autophosphorylation were also identified in the protein. Homology assessment of AbMAPK1 showed several conserved regions, and ark clam (Aplysia californica) showed the highest sequence identity (87.9%). The phylogenetic analysis supported close evolutionary kinship with molluscan orthologs. Constitutive expression of AbMAPK1 was observed in six different tissues of disk abalone, with the highest expression in the digestive tract, followed by the gills and hemocytes. Highest AbMAPIC1 mRNA expression level was detected at the trochophore developmental stage, suggesting its role in abalone cell differentiation and proliferation. Significant modulation of AbMAPK1 expression under pathogenic stress suggested its putative involvement in the immune defense mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Total protein, free glucose, glycogen and total lipid content were determined in the digestive gland and foot/adductor muscle. One subset of older animals, from each feeding treatment, was subjected to water content analysis by drying. Subsets of older and younger animals were subjected to a simulated live export trial to determine mass loss. Digestive gland tissue proved to be of little value for routine monitoring. Muscle glucose, muscle lipid and muscle protein concentrations were affected by month and age. Muscle glycogen concentration was affected by month, age and feeding regime. During simulated export trials, animals lost on average 15% body mass, being significantly higher (p < 0.01) in younger compared to older animals. Feeding regime did not influence susceptibility to mass loss during export. Animal age influenced the biochemical composition and export performance of abalone.",10.2989/18142321003714302

The cephalic, epipodial and mantle tentacles bear papillae with ciliary tufts at their tips. Chemoreceptors with 14-21 ciliated cells were found at high density on the snout. When the tentacles were touched with a bamboo rod or a piece of plastic sheet, the abalone contracted the tentacle stimulated, indicating mechanoreception. The contact of a piece of brown algae Laminaria japonica to any of three tentacles elicited a typical feeding response: shell lifting, pedal sole expansion and lifting, and food seizing with pedal sole. The response disappeared when the algae was separated from the tentacles, indicating that the ciliated cells were contact chemoreceptors as well as mechanoreceptors. A possibility of distant chemoreception was examined in a Y-maze in which seawater flowed over the algae and was directed towards the abalone. The algal stimulant triggered the food searching movement of the abalone which randomly chose both the stimulant containing water from the algal containing side and the control water without stimulant. This implies the possession of distant chemoreception possibly by the osphradium, but the abalone lacks a function to detect the origin of the smell.",10.2331/suisan.76.185

C11 at 0 (control), 10(4), 10(5), and 10(6) CFU/g of feed for 45 d. There were three replicate tanks per dietary treatment. The specific growth rates were higher in all sea cucumbers treated with Rhodotorula sp. C11 than in the controls. Following a challenge with V. splendidus NB13, the cumulative prevalence and mortality of sea cucumbers fed diets supplemented with Rhodotorula sp. C11 were lower than in animals fed the basal diet. In sea cucumbers fed diets supplemented with Rhodotorula sp. C11 for 42 d, the only viable yeast found in the intestine was Rhodotorula sp. C11, which had counts of 1.58-1.98 x 10(4) CFU/g. No yeast was isolated from the intestine of animals fed the basal diet. For the colonization study, 20 sea cucumbers from each dietary treatment were removed to separate tanks and fed the control diet from day 16 to day 46. The viable yeast (Rhodotorula sp.

The immune- stimulating potential of two hydrolysed protein sources (self-prepared fish silage and a commercial fish protein hydrolysate) at two dietary inclusion levels in abalone diets was therefore measured in the South African abalone Haliotis midae, using animals of initial mean weight of 123 g-128 g. Diets containing the high inclusion levels were also fed in two feeding regimes: continuous feeding, or phase feeding, where the hydrolysed protein diets were alternated monthly with the control diet. In low inclusion diets, hydrolysate inclusion contributed 6 g center dot kg(-1) protein in the final diet, whilst in high inclusion diets this was increased to 18 g center dot kg(-1). It was found that the low inclusion level of the commercial hydrolysate significantly increased the cellular immunity through increasing the phagocytic activity of haemocytes by 18% compared to the control diet, whilst none of the other diets showed any significant differences compared to the control. Both inclusion levels of the commercial hydrolysed protein significantly improved daily weight increase of animals. Phase feeding had no positive impacts on immunity or production performance. The inclusion of both types of hydrolysed protein sources significantly decreased the water stability of feeds compared to the control, except at the lowest inclusion level of the commercial hydrolysate. It is concluded that the use of dietary hydrolysed proteins can lead to improved cellular immunity and growth in abalone, however it is important to determine appropriate inclusion levels to prevent negative impacts on feed water stability and production performance.

The water diffusion coefficient of the pellets was determined using the equation of Fick's second law, which resulted in values between 0.84-1.94x10-10 m(2)/s. The drying kinetics was modeled using Page, Modified Page, Root of time, Exponential, Logarithmic, Two-Terms, Modified Henderson-Pabis and Weibull models. In addition, two new models, referred to as 'Proposed' models 1 and 2, were used to simulate this process.

Results showed that the growth rate of abalone was significantly affected by dietary lipid sources (P < 0.05). The dietary lipid, FO produced the highest weight gain rate (WGR, 413.2%), closely followed by LO (389.0%) and SO (382.4%). These three WGR values were not significantly different to each other. However, abalone fed the TP diet showed a significantly lower WGR (267.3%). Carcass moisture and protein were independent of dietary treatment. but the TP diet resulted in significantly lower carcass lipid. The fatty acid profile in abalone carcass reflected that of dietary lipids, especially the unsaturated fatty acids. It appears that H. discus hannai have a capacity to synthesize 20:5n-3, 20:4n-6 and 22:6n-3 from 18-carbon PUFAs and even from 16:0 through elongation and desaturation. However, the capacity seems to be insufficient to support the maximum growth of abalone.",

Two groups of abalone were fed (1% body weight per day) over a four-month period with different diets. The control diet consisted of a standard commercial pellet feed (AbMax 16), whereas the treatment diet was additionally enriched with the probiotic mix. At the end of the experiment, probiotic-fed animals showed improved growth compared with control-fed abalone in length (32.3% vs 22.3%), width (31.9% vs 20.7%) and wet weight (109.6% vs 72.8%), respectively. Haemolymph sampling was conducted at the beginning of the experiment and after 2 and 4 months. Haemolymph samples were analysed for total haemocyte count (THC) and viability, presence of apoptotic cells and production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Compared with control abalone, probiotic-fed abalone had significantly higher THC (1.9 x 10(6) vs 5.6 x 10(6) cells), higher viability (90.8% vs 75.6%), higher percentage of ROS-positive cells (19.4% vs 0.5%) and higher numbers of non-apoptotic cells (88.0% vs 78.0%), respectively. These results indicate that the probiotic-enriched diet enhanced the immunostimulatory mechanisms, with a simultaneous low-level up-regulation of ROS production as a priming mechanism of the antibacterial defence system. Metabolomics-based profiling of foot muscle tissue additionally revealed that probiotic-fed abalone differentially expressed 17 unique metabolites, including amino acids, fatty acids and TCA cycle related compounds.

The 32-week trial was divided into two phases, a somatic growth phase (20 weeks) and a gonad enhancement phase (12 weeks), with different combinations of feeds tested during each phase. The five feeding regimes included an FU only treatment for 32 weeks; FU for 20 weeks followed by the 20U diet for 12 weeks (FU- 20U); and, similarly, FU-0U, 20U-FU and 0U-FU treatment regimes for 20 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively. Comparable somatic growth was recorded during the first 20 weeks of the trial from ju-venile/small adult urchins fed the formulated feed containing Ulva (20U) and the fresh Ulva (FU) diet; whereas a formulated feed with the same nutritional properties, but without the addition of Ulva (0U), produced urchins that were significantly smaller. Gonad production during the first 20 weeks of the trial was higher for urchins fed formulated feeds (0U and 20U); however, the reduced test size of urchins fed the 0U diet resulted in a significantly reduced gonad mass. Following the change in diets at 20 weeks, both gonad size and colour were significantly affected. Formulated feeds promoted gonad growth of urchins previously fed FU, while administration of FU improved gonad colour of urchins previously fed the formulated diets. The FU only treatment produced gonads with the most desirable colour, but these gonads were smaller in size compared with urchins fed dry formulated feeds. These data suggest that the use of high protein formulated diets during the somatic growth phase of small adult urchins is not necessary, as comparable growth can be produced by feeding Ulva. Gonad production on a diet of Ulva alone, however, is significantly lower than that obtained using a formulated diet. It is therefore recommended that FU is used for the somatic growth phases of this species, while formulated feeds, especially the 20U diet, are used subsequently for gonad development and/or enhancement. Statement of relevance: The combination of sea urchin/Ulva systems will be very beneficial to the commercial production of Tripneustes gratilla, in terms of lowering farm operational costs, as fresh Ulva armoricana can produce better/comparable somatic growth to high protein (26%) formulated feeds (0U and 20U). Dry formulated feeds such as 20U should be used at the end of cultivation as a finishing feed, 2 months prior to harvest, to enhance gonad growth and increase product yield. Findings from this study will contribute to lowering operating costs and help to improve the commercial success of echinoculture operations, focused on the production of T. gratilla, in South Africa and around the world.

Three phlorotannin-rich fractions from the methanol extracts of E. cava and E. kurome, which are perennial algae, showed potent feeding-deterrent activity as in the cases of E. stolonifera and Eisenia bicyclis. On the other hand, none of the fractions from the methanol extracts of four Laminaria species, which are annual algae, showed any significant feeding-deterrent activity as in the cases of Eckloniopsis radicosa. Among four perennial species, the feeding-deterrent activities are, in order of effectiveness, E. stolonifera, E. kurome, E. cava, and Eisenia bicyclis, this being in reciprocal proportion to their size. It was concluded that laminariaceous algae have a chemical defense mechanism against marine herbivores, which adaptively depends on the rate of algal growth and size.",

This study examines the effect of macroalgae Ulva lactuca and Spyridia filamentosa, cyanobacteria Arthrospira maxima, and microalgae Dunaliella salina on the growth and immunity of Haliotis laevigata, in comparison to a commercially formulated pellet. Over 12 weeks, U. Iactuca or S. filamentosa produced the lowest growth rate, indicating lack of nutrients for abalone growth in a single macroalgae diet. Pellets supplemented with 10% A. maxima or D. salina resulted in increased abalone shell length (13.3 and 30.7%, respectively) and body weight (19.9 and 33.4%) over the pellet control diet. The impact of algal supplementation on hemolymph immunity was mainly represented by a drop in total hemocyte counts (THC) and some diet specific effects on superoxide anion and antibacterial activity against Vibrio anguillarum. No effect of diet was observed on phagocytosis, phenoloxidase, or antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1. It is conceived that the humoral antimicrobial factors in abalone hemolymph are innately biosynthesized rather than dietary derived compounds. Nevertheless, concomitant with strong antiviral activity against HSV-1 in a lipophilic extract of U. lactuca and S. filamentosa, higher antiviral activity was detected in the digestive lipid extract of abalone fed U. lactuca (64.2% at 650 mu g ml(-1)) or S. filamentosa (69.51%) compared to abalone fed pellets (47.42%) or pellets supplemented with A. maxima (46.3%) or D. sauna (46%). This suggests that abalone may also derive some protection against oral pathogens by algal derived bioactive compounds. These results indicate that abalone growth rate could be optimized by A. maxima and D. salina supplementations, whereas U. lactuca and S. filamentosa could be useful supplements for abalone aquaculture, especially in areas with high risk of herpesvirus infection.

Each library has an average of 53,361,675 clean reads. Approximately 85.71% reads were mapped to the reference genome of Haliotis discus hannai Ino. In comparison with A0h group, 7,656 and 2,789 genes were differentially expressed in the A8h and A48h groups, respectively. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mostly enriched in oxidation-reduction process and oxidoreductase activity from GO analysis as well as immunity and metabolism-related pathways from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis. Cluster analysis demonstrated that all DEGs were categorized into eight subclusters by adopting the gene expression model. Specifically, a total of 1,070 significantly downregulated genes from two clusters were related to some metabolic pathways, ABC transporters, and cell adhesion. Moreover, 212 upregulated genes in one subcluster were enriched in several immune-related pathways, including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling pathway and apoptosis. Some members of the pattern recognition receptors family, which can initiate inflammatory signaling and induce apoptosis, were stimulated to upregulate in gill after challenge including C1q, perlucin, and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. In addition, caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway was inactive, whereas caspase-independent apoptosis pathway was stimulating in response to Vibrio challenge. To eliminate invading pathogen, the immune effectors such as interleukin-17, matrix metalloproteinase, lysozyme, superoxide, and ferritin were also stimulated in gill. Moreover, this study also provides more information for comprehending the immunity and defense mechanisms against V. parahaemolyticus infection in abalone.",10.3389/fmars.2022.956317

The economic viability of commercial abalone farming depends largely on the rearing system employed and the feeding sources employed during the grow-out culture period. We studied the effects of two land-based culture systems on the growth performance of abalone and the nutritional quality of their tissues, in a crossed design. Recirculated (RAS) and open flow (FLOW) culture systems were compared. Fresh macro algae (FMA) (Gracilaria cornea and Ulva rigida) were compared to manufactured compound feed (CF) and a mixture of both (MIX). Survival rates were high (97-100%) regardless the treatments tested. MIX and FMA diets produced the best results for Shell Growth Rate, Specific growth rates for shell growth (SGRsl) and weight (SGRw) as well as Food Conversion Ratio (FCR). The highest value for feed intake was recorded for the MIX diet. A positive relationship has been observed between the amounts of protein and lipids in diets and the disposition of these in the viscera of animals fed such diets.

Two-way {2 type sulphur [liquid type (LTS) and nano-powder type (NTS)] x5 sulphur concentrations (25, 50, 100, 250 and 500 ppm)} ANOVA design was applied. LTS and NTS were included in the control (Con) diet at five sulphur concentrations instead of equal amount of water and cellulose, referred to as the LTS25, LTS50, LTS100, LTS250 and LTS500, and NTS25, NTS50, NTS100, NTS250 and NTS500 diets, respectively. Sea cucumbers were fed with triplicate groups of each diet for 8 weeks. After 8-week feeding trial, sea cucumbers were exposed to 30-h air and 12-h low salinity exposure stressors and cumulative mortality was monitored. Survival was not affected by either sulphur type or sulphur concentration. Weight gain of sea cucumber was affected by both sulphur type and concentration. Sea cucumber fed all NTS diets except for the NTS25 diet achieved better weight gain than that fed the Con and all LTS diets. Chemical composition of sea cucumber was not affected by either dietary sulphur type or sulphur concentration. The cumulative mortality of sea cucumber was affected by both sulphur type and concentration after the 30-h air and 12-h low salinity exposure stressors. In conclusion, NTS was more effective than LTS to improve growth and lower mortality of sea cucumber subjected to the 30-h air and 12-h low salinity exposures.

It was found that ESBM can replace fish meal (FM) either partially or completely in diets for some fish and shrimp species. In the present study, the effects of replacing dietary FM with ESBM on growth performance, intestinal microbiota, immunity and mTOR pathway in abalone Haliotis discus hannai (initial weight: 16.75 +/- 0.09 g) were investigated after a 100-day feeding trial. Five experimental diets were designed to replace 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of dietary FM by ESBM, which were named as ESBM0 (control), ESBM25, ESBM50, ESBM75 and ESBM100, respectively. Results showed that ESBM could replace up to 75% of FM in the diet without significant effect on the weight gain rate (WGR, 118.05%- 124.16%) of abalone. The increasing dietary ESBM levels significantly decreased the trypsin activity from 418.52 to 286.52 U/mg protein in the digestive gland. No significant differences in the contents of total cholesterol (T-CHO), ammonia (BLA) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in cell-free hemolymph were observed among the groups with replacement levels of dietary FM by ESBM from 0% to 75%. Excessive replacement level of FM with ESBM (ESBM100) significantly increased the MDA content (2.33 nmol/mg prot.) and pro-inflammatory-related gene expression in digestive gland. Compared with the control group, the mTOR pathway in muscle was significantly upregulated in the ESBM75 group. The digestive gland in the ESBM100 group contained more golden refractile spherules than those in the other groups. The abundance of intestinal microbes such as Halomonas, Zobellella and Bacillus was decreased in the ESBM100 group.

The 20% U. pinnatifida was included in the control (CLB0) diet. The 25, 50, 75, and 100% of U. pinnatifida were substituted with an equal amount of CLB, referred to as the CLB25, CLB50, CLB75, and CLB100 diets, respectively.

Abalone were fed with one of the experimental diets once a day at a satiation level with a little leftover for 16 weeks. Water stability of dry matter content in all formulated diets was changed over all the observation periods, and their significant interaction was also observed. The retention of dry matter content in all formulated diets was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that in the dry U. pinnatifida at all periods of observation after seawater immersion. Survival, weight gain, and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone fed all formulated diets were greater than those of abalone fed the dry U. pinnatifida. However, weight gain and SGR of abalone fed the CLB25, CLB50, CLB75, and CLB100 diets were not significantly (P > 0.05) different from those of abalone fed the CLB0 diet. Shell height, width, and length of abalone fed all formulated diets were significantly (P < 0.05) higher, wider, and longer than those of abalone fed the dry U. pinnatifida.

Selective breeding serves as an effective strategy to further enhance the yield potential of cultivated organisms. In this study, we report the performance of an abalone strain (HX) that had undergone intensive mass selection for high-yield at one year of age for nine generations. Results showed that seven-month-old juvenile abalone from the HX strain (with a shell length of 34.41 f 3.70 mm and a wet weight of 5.54 f 1.56 g) were significantly larger (P < 0.05) than those from the control strain (with a shell length of 27.43 f 2.56 mm and a wet weight of 2.93 f 0.79 g). Compared to parental abalones from the control group, the larger parental abalones from the HX strain produced more oocytes with larger yolk, resulting in offspring with a significantly higher (P < 0.05) metamorphosis rate. In terms of artificial feed utilization, juvenile abalone from the HX strain spent significantly more time (P < 0.05) feeding than those from the control strain. Furthermore, the organic matter and protein contents in the mixture of residual feed and feces in the HX strain's cultivating ponds were 25.9 % and 29.3 % lower than those in the control strain, respectively.

However, a limited occurrence of the orange-footed muscle trait makes it a valuable candidate for breeding programs. In our research, we examined the inheritance pattern of the orange-footed trait and conducted a 90-day feeding trial for H. gigantea to compare the influence of formulated feed and macroalgae on pigment enrichment and growth rates. Our results suggest that the orange-footed trait has a recessive nature relative to its common counterpart and demonstrates stable inheritance. We also identified a significant correlation between color-difference values (a*) and total carotenoid content (TCC) (R-2 = 0.955, p < 0.05), suggesting the TCC in abalone foot muscle can be estimated using the a* value. Furthermore, introducing carotenoids to formulated feed imparts an orange hue to the foot muscle, but this effect is inferior compared to using Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis with a similar carotenoid content. This suggests that H. gigantea has a higher absorption efficiency for the carotenoids from the macroalgae G. lemaneiformis compared to formulated feed. Growth assessments indicate that the formulated feed, enriched with higher crude protein than G. lemaneiformis, optimally supports H. gigantea growth. Our findings furnish valuable insights that could steer breeding strategies and feeding practices towards achieving the orange-footed muscle trait in H. gigantea.",10.3390/fishes8090443

We aimed to determine if dietary intervention could alleviate mortality demonstrated by abalone at high water temperatures. As this issue is most relevant to farm production, we aimed to demonstrate that different mortality patterns are evident for 2- and 3-year-old greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata Donovan), irrespective of reproductive state, and to provide potential, practical solutions to this issue. Growth rate, feed intake and haemolymph variables were measured. To test if dietary intervention could minimise mortality at high water temperatures, we selected a commercial diet routinely fed on-farm when SM occurred, as a negative survival control, and live macroalgae (Ulva lactuca Linnaeus) as a positive survival control. In Experiment 1, 30 mm 2-year-old and 70 mm 3-year-old abalone were subjected to water temperatures of 18, 22 and 26 degrees C for 36 days. In Experiment 2, 60 mm 3-year-olds were subjected to 22 and 26 degrees C for 38 days. In Experiment 1, survival was > 95% for all treatments at 18 and 22 degrees C (P > 0.05); whereas, survival was significantly reduced by 35% in 3-year-olds fed the commercial diet at 26 degrees C compared to all other treatments (P < 0.05). In Experiment 2, there was no mortality at 22 degrees C. At 26 degrees C, survival was significantly reduced by 50% (P < 0.05) for the commercial diet, whereas, survival was > 97% for the U. lactuca diet. We demonstrated that dietary intervention reduced mortality in larger abalone at 26 degrees C. We also demonstrated a pattern of mortality in response to high water temperatures that differed for age classes. This information is invaluable for further systematic research to alleviate on-farm abalone mortality associated with high summer water temperatures, particularly in the areas of nutritional or therapeutic intervention.

Results of clustering analysis and principal component analysis of chemical data also revealed that the two cooked meats differed from each other in terms of their measured constituent compositions irrespective of sampling periods. Compared with G-small abalone, A-small abalone meats were lower in taurine and arginine, but higher in glycine (Gly), glutamic acid (Glu), alanine, serine, proline, adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and glycogen.

It has regulation functions in glucose metabolism in mammals and fish. In the present study, a gene of the foxo homolog in abalone Haliotis discus hannai was cloned. A conservative forkhead (FH) domain and a transactivation (FoxO-TAD) domain were identified. Abalone foxo-specific siRNA (small interfering RNA) was injected to investigate the functions of foxo on glucose metabolism. Knockdown of foxo inhibited expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pepck) and significantly increased expressions of hexokinase (hk) and pyruvate kinase (pk), but it failed to inhibit the relative mRNA level of glucose-6-phosphatase (g6pase). Then, a 100-day feeding trial was conducted to investigate the response of foxo and glucose metabolism in abalone fed with 1.57% (LFD, low-fat diet), 3.82% (MFD, middle-fat diet) and 6.72% (HFD, high-fat diet) of dietary lipid, respectively. The insulin-signaling pathway (AKT) was depressed and FoxO was activated by the HFD, but it did not inhibit glycolysis (hk) or improved gluconeogenesis significantly (pepck and g6pase). At the same time, impaired hepatopancreas glycogen storage raised hemolymph glucose levels.

Compared with the control group, the specific growth rate (SGR) and weight gain (WG) were significantly decreased in the treatment groups supplemented with Radix Isatidis. However, supplementation with 2.5 to 10.0 g/kg of Radix Isatidis did not produce an effect on mortality. Mortality was recorded after the leeches were challenged with P. mirabilis, and changes were observed in the serum cortisol, glucose, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 3,5,30-triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxin (T4), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total protein (TP), globin, and lysozyme contents.

Recent research suggests that temperature-induced tissue breakdown allows bacteria entry to the host, and nutritional supplementation can alleviate this breakdown. The aim of this study was to alleviate mortality of greenlip abalone, Haliotis laevigata, cultured at high summer water temperatures (25 degrees C) by dietary intervention using graded levels of peanut skin extract (PE; 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5%), green tea extract (GTE; 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5%) and vitamin C (1.0% vitamin C; 1.0% vitamin C + 1.0% GTE; and 1.0% vitamin C + 1.0% PE) in a commercial diet; these supplements contain antioxidant and bioactive compounds. The commercial diet containing 5.0% Australian grapeseed extract (GSE) fed at 25 degrees C was also included as a negative temperature/positive diet control due to improved survival and health of abalone at high temperatures in our previous study. Three-year-old abalone (49.21 g; 70.26 mm) were fed the commercial diet at 22 degrees C (positive temperature control), and the commercial diet (negative temperature control) and test diets at 25 degrees C for 38 days. Abalone survival was 85% for the commercial diet at 22 degrees C, whereas survival of abalone was significantly reduced to 40% when fed the commercial diet at 25 degrees C. There were no significant differences in survival of abalone fed the commercial diet at 22 degrees C and those fed 5.0% GSE, 0.5% GTE and 2.5% GTE diets at 25 degrees C. Supplements did not significantly affect oxygen consumption, ammonia excretion rates and total hemocyte count. Abalone fed 5.0% GTE had significantly lower phagocytic activity than those fed the commercial control diet at 22 degrees C. Supplementation with PE and vitamin C had no beneficial effects on survival, while GTE holds promise as a potential dietary additive to enhance the survival of abalone at higher water temperature. This study confirms that supplementation of 5.0% GSE in the commercial diet also improves the survival of greenlip abalone cultured at high summer water temperature in the laboratory setting. Statement of relevance: Purported to have diverse health benefits including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties, 5% Australian grape extract, graded levels of green tea extract, peanut skin extract and vitamin C were supplemented in a commercial abalone diet in order to improve survival of greenlip abalone at high water temperature.

"Lesoway, MP; Page, LR",Growth and differentiation during delayed metamorphosis of feeding gastropod larvae: signatures of ancestry and innovation,2008,MARINE BIOLOGY,153,4,723,734,,"Extent of larval growth among marine invertebrates has potentially profound implications for performance by benthic recruits because body size influences many biological processes. Among gastropods, feeding larvae often attain larger size at metamorphic competence than non-feeding larvae of basal gastropod clades. Delay of metamorphosis can further influence size at recruitment if larvae continue to grow during the delay. Some caenogastopod larvae grow during delayed metamorphosis, but opisthobranch larvae do not. Data on larval growth of neritimorph gastropods are needed to help determine which of these growth patterns for planktotrophic gastropod larvae is more derived. We cultured planktotrophic larvae from all three major gastropod clades with feeding larvae through delays of metamorphosis of 3-10 weeks. Larvae of the caenogastropod Euspira lewisii and the euthyneurans Haminoea vesicula (Opisthobranchia) and Siphonaria denticulata (Pulmonata) conformed to previously described growth patterns for their respective major clades. Furthermore, the caenogastropod continued to lengthen the prototroch (ciliary band for swimming and feeding) and to differentiate prospective post-metamorphic structures (gill filaments and radular teeth) during delayed metamorphosis. Larvae of the neritimorph Nerita atramentosa arrested shell growth during delayed metamorphosis but the radula continued to elongate, a pattern most similar to that of non-feeding larvae of Haliotis, a vetigastropod genus. Character mapping on a phylogenetic hypothesis suggests that large larval size and capacity for continued growth during delayed metamorphosis, as exhibited by some caenogastropods, is a derived innovation among feeding gastropod larvae. This novelty may have facilitated post-metamorphic evolution of predatory feeding using a long proboscis.",10.1007/s00227-007-0849-z

Recent research identified higher optimal dietary CP levels of greater than or equal to 35% for younger than 1-y-old abalone at higher water temperatures (20-22 degrees C). To validate the results of the laboratory-based research, the current trial was designed to investigate the effect of feeding two different commercially manufactured diets (standard-protein diet, 32% CP, versus a high-protein diet, 39% CP) to hybrid abalone (Haliotis laevigata x Haliotis rubra; initial weight: 3.10 g) on growth performance, feed utilization, and sales revenue under on-farm conditions. During this 18-mo trial, abalone were cultured using normal commercial practices over two summer periods at Great Southern Waters abalone farm (Indented Head, VIC, Australia). A significant improvement in specific growth rate (SGR) led to a 9% improvement in biomass gain for abalone fed with the high-protein diet. This improvement was achieved with no differences in survival, and minimal difference in feed input between diets. In addition, the feed conversion ratio of abalone fed with the high-protein feed was 7.1% superior to that of animals fed with the standard-protein diet. On the basis of a farm gate value of AUD35/kg abalone, for an additional feed input cost of AUD2/m(2) slab tank/y, a 9.5% increase in basic annual sales revenue (AUD44/m(2) slab tank/y) was achieved feeding the high-protein diet. In addition, due to an increased SGR by feeding the high-protein diet, the duration of a typical 3-y production cycle for hybrid abalone may be shortened by up to 3.4 mo. By adopting the high-protein diet, farmers may also harvest abalone sooner, and reduce exposure to one less summer. This may reduce heat-related mortalities and further improve productivity, and when combined with savings made with biomass and feed efficiency gains, a more than 10% improvement in productivity across the entire grow-out period for hybrid abalone may be achieved.",10.2983/035.035.0316

This study evaluated some parameters of the systemic antioxidant and immune responses in red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) exposed to 0.25 mL L- 1 eugenol (EUB), 3.0 mL L- 1 phenoxyethanol (PEB) and CO2 at saturation, as well as in a control (CT) without anesthetic. Abalone were anesthetized for 45 min and, during the recovery stage, hemolymph samples were collected at 0.5, 1, 2 and 24 h. Total protein content (TP), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, as well as nitric oxide (NO) production, were evaluated in hemolymph cell-free fraction (HCF) and hemocytes lysate (HL). In addition, total hemocyte count (THC) was determined. In HCF, TP was significantly higher in abalone exposed to PEB than in the other treatments and CT at 0.5, 1 and 24 h. SOD activity in HCF was significantly higher in all treatments compared to the CT (1 h), while CAT and MPO activity was only significantly higher in abalone exposed to EUB compared to PEB at 1, 2 and 24 h. In the HL fraction, the percentage of SOD inhibition was significantly higher only in abalone anesthetized with EUB compared to the CT (0.5 h). These results suggest that the antioxidant activity of the species during the recovery phase from anesthesia was transient and restored after 24 h. Similarly, the immune response of H. rufescens at the systemic level was not altered by the anesthetics, suggesting that the species adequately tolerated the anesthesia process. This research provides evidence of the effects of anesthesia at the systemic level in red abalone for the proper selection of anesthetics for pearl culture.",10.1016/j.cbpa.2024.111800

As abalone is herbivorous, the use of local collected algae as feed may appear advantageous. The nutritional value of eight monospecific seaweed diets was studied using Palmaria palmata (Rhodophyta), filamentous algae, mainly Gracilaria sp. (Rhodophyta), Enteromorpha sp. and Ulva Laura (Chlorophyta), together with Saccharin latissima, Saccorhiza polyschides, Laminaria digitata and Laminaria hyperborea (Ochrophyta, Phaeophyceae) and a mixed macroalgal diet. An integrative approach consisted in monitoring the seasonal composition changes of these algae in terms of protein, lipid, soluble carbohydrate, fatty acid and amino-acid contents, and to relate it to seasonal growth and reproduction investment during a large-scale experiment. Abalone and algae were studied for one year in commercial sea-cage structures. Abalone fed with monospecific diet using either P. palmata or S. latissima, and with mixed diet presented the best growth rate, muscle ratio and gonad development. Seasonal daily weight gain was mainly associated with n-3/n-6 ratio, soluble carbohydrate content and total protein content. In term of aminoacid contents, the daily weight gain was associated with free phenylalanine as well as isoleucine levels. Moreover, 90% of 2-years old abalone started gonad development but less than a quarter featured a fully matured gonad. The gonad development of H. tuberculata was mostly associated to total valine, methionine, leucine, arginine and isoleucine levels. The age of initial sexual maturity in H. tuberculata turned to be a highly plastic trait in response to different growth rates and algal diets. Even if P. palmata is the best option for growth performance, mixed diets should probably be preferred to a monospecific diet in order to avoid too high pressure on a single algal resource.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.734385

For 131 days, abalone were fed diets containing three different levels of protein (42%, 36% and 32%), each level containing two ranges of starch:lipid ratios (1.5-1.8 or 3.2-3.6). The gross energy content of the diets ranged from 4.26-3.68 kcal/g. Within a particular protein level, growth did not differ significantly. When dietary protein levels exceeded 32%, a trend of higher growth of abalone was observed for dietary treatments that contained lower levels of lipid (higher starch to lipid ratios). The amount of protein consumed daily for the 32%a dietary protein is apparently insufficient to meet requirements for energy and maximum growth. No notable diet-dependent differences in the proportional composition (dry weight) of the shell and the soft tissue, and the energy content of the soft tissue were observed. Daily food intake and consumed energy were significantly different among treatments, being inversely related to the calculated P:E ratios. The increased consumption may have been somewhat overestimated because of loss arising from lower water stability of the diets. Ammonia excretion ranged from 7.9-4.8 mu g NH(4)(+)/h /g abalone but was not significantly different among treatments except for the treatment containing 32% crude protein and a low carbohydrate: lipid ratio. Specific Dynamic Action (SDA) comprised nearly 50% of measured oxygen consumption and did not significantly differ among treatments. Respiration increased during the night showing a typical circadian pattern reported in Haliotis genera. Measured mucus production (lid not vary among treatments. Carbohydrate preferentially serves as the principal energy source and a consistent amount of dietary protein is also used as an energy source, regardless of dietary protein content. Within a developed energy budget, approximately 70% of the ingested energy was lost through feces. and approximately 25% of the ingested energy was metabolized, with 7% to 10% channeled to growth. A direct determination of available digestible energy was not possible because of the inability to collect sufficient feces to estimate fecal energy. The results suggest that practical diets should include levels of dietary protein that are approximately 35% protein to meet requirements for energy and maximum growth. In addition, carbohydrates seem to be the preferred energy source and lipid levels should be minimized to the extent that essential fatty acids requirements are met.",

The growth and feeding rates of abalones were inhibited during the early stage of exposure to different extents, but then recovered to nearly the control levels. A large portion of Ag was redistributed to organelles and metal-rich granules from the cellular debris fraction, whereas cellular debris and metallothionein-like protein were the dominant pools for the storage of Cd, which remained comparable during the exposure period. The MT concentrations were significantly elevated (in a dose-dependent manner) within the first 2 weeks of exposure, after which the MT concentrations started to decrease. All these results implied that abalones respond rapidly to metal exposure, but apparently developed subsequent acclimation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2010.05.018

Diets were formulated to contain three levels of protein (24, 34 and 44%), each with three levels of fat (2, 6, and 10%), to produce diets with estimated protein energy (PE) ratios ranging from 14.5-32.0 mg/kJ. The rates of weight gain, nutritional indices and body composition of both the smaller (0.2-1.0 g) and larger (7.0-14.0 g) abalone were significantly affected by the levels of protein and energy in the diets. Moreover, the two size classes of abalone differed in their responses to the diets. Maximum growth was achieved at a higher dietary protein level in the larger abalone (44%) than the smaller abalone (34%). The protein content of the larger abalone soft tissue was higher (ca. 7%) than the smaller abalone. Irrespective of the lipid content, the percentage of protein deposited by the larger abalone was highest in those fed the 34 and 44% protein diets, whereas that of the smaller abalone was highest for the 24 and 34% protein diets. The condition factor (CF) of small abalone was significantly higher for those fed the 24% protein diets in comparison to those fed the 34 and 44% protein diets, whereas the reverse was found in the larger abalone. It was concluded that the larger abalone had a higher protein requirement than the smaller abalone. Diets containing the highest level of dietary fat (10%) produced significantly lower growth rates and efficiencies of protein deposition in comparison to abalone fed the diets containing 6 and 2% fat, however, these trends were more marked among the small abalone size class. In addition, the feed conversion ratio (FCR) of small abalone fed the 10% fat diets was consistently poorer, but this trend was not present among the larger abalone whose FCR improved with an increasing PE ratio. It was concluded that a dietary lipid level of 10% is too high for H. midae to maintain a maximal growth rate. Proximal analysis of abalone fed the experimental diets revealed that the PE ratio of the diet as well as abalone size significantly affected the carcass composition.

The isolates were cultivated in TMP broth and TMP broth with the addition of 0.5% glucose, 1% sucrose, 1% lactose or 0.5% skim milk in microtiter plates stained with crystal violet. We demonstrated that S. uberis isolated from bovine mastitis are able to produce biofilms in TMP broth and, also that biofilm formation by S. uberis can be significantly enhanced by the addition of 0.5% glucose or 1% sucrose to TMP broth. This may suggest that the carbohydrates in milk or within the ruminant gut might affect the growth mode of S. uberis. In addition, our results showed that in vitro biofilm production under different conditions of supplementation displays variation among the isolates and that each isolate shows a particular profile of biofilm production. This phenotypic heterogeneity in biofilm production exhibited by S. uberis could at least partly explain why this bacterium has the ability to adapt to different niches facilitating survival to diverse and stressful conditions.

In the current study, a member of the MACPF domain-containing proteins, macrophage expressed gene-1 (MPEG1) encoding 730 amino acids with the theoretical molecular mass of 79.6 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.49 was characterized from disk abalone Haliotis discus discus (AbMPEG1). We found that the characteristic MACPF domain (val(131)-Tyr(348)) and transmembrane segment (Ala(669)-Ile(691)) of AbMPEG1 are located in the N- and C-terminal ends of the protein, respectively. Ortholog comparison revealed that AbMPEG1 has the highest sequence identity with its pink abalone counterpart, while sequences identities of greater than 90% were observed with MPEG1 members from other abalone species. Likewise, the furin cleavage site KRRRK was highly conserved in all abalone species, but not in other species investigated. We identified an intron-less genomic sequence within disk abalone AbMPEG1, which was similar to other mammalian, avian, and reptilian counterparts. Transcription factor binding sites, which are important for immune responses, were identified in the 5'-flanking region of AbMPEG1. qPCR revealed AbMPEG1 transcripts are present in every tissues examined, with the highest expression level occurring in mantle tissue. Significant up-regulation of AbMPEG1 transcript levels was observed in hemocytes and gill tissues following challenges with pathogens (Vibrio parahemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus) as well as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs: lipopolysaccharides and poly I:C immunostimulant). Finally, the antibacterial activity of the MACPF domain was characterized against Gram-negative and -positive bacteria using a recombinant peptide.

The immune and inflammatory responses of invertebrate clade B SERPINs have not been widely reported. In the present study, three proteins with high similarity to clade B SERPINs, referred to as AbSERPIN-1, AbSERPIN-2 and AbSERPIN-3, were identified from disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus). While AbSERPIN-1 (399 aa) was of a typical size for this protein class, AbSERPIN-2 (506 aa) and AbSERPIN-3 (532 aa) were relatively larger. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the characteristic SERPIN domain in each AbSERPIN. In addition, the N-terminal region of both AbSERPIN-2 and AbSERPIN-3 contained a predicted low complexity region (LCR) and a signal peptide, suggesting that these proteins are secretory proteins and are, thus, novel peptides. Tertiary structural models of the AbSERPINs highlighted their structural and functional conservation. Ubiquitous expression of AbSERPIN transcripts was evaluated by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) analysis in seven tissue types. AbSERPIN-1, AbSERPIN-2, and AbSERPIN-3 transcript levels were highest in mantle, hemocytes, and muscles, respectively. Temporal expression analysis revealed that AbSERPINs were significantly (P < 0.05) elevated in hemocytes during the early/middle stages following the injection of a bacterial pathogen (Vibrio parahaemolyticus or Listeria monocytogenes) or an immuno-stimulant (lipopolysaccharide). Moreover, mantle tissue injury led to significant changes in the temporal expression of AbSERPIN mRNA. Specifically, transcription of AbSERPIN-1 and AbSERPIN-3 was considerably up-regulated, while expression of AbSERPIN-2 was suppressed. These results suggest a potential role of AbSERPINs in response to pathogen invasion and tissue injury in disk abalone. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.fsi.2015.04.020

The 3-probiotic supplemented feed produced a significant shell length increase of 20.9%, a wet weight gain of 19.8% and a five-fold reduction in mortality compared to the controls. The 2-probiotic supplemented feed resulted in significant increases in shell length (15.4%) and reduced mortality (fivefold), but not in weight gain, compared to controls.",10.1080/00288330.2014.909857

Triplicate groups of juvenile abalone [initial mass was (0.96 +/- 0.02) g, shell length was (17.70 +/- 0.06) mm] were fed to satiation one of three semi-purified diets containing 0, 1 x 10(3), 1 x 10 6 IU vitamin A per kilogram diet, respectively. Results showed that the daily increment in shell length (DISL) of abalone in the treatment with 1 x 10(3) IU vitamin A per kilogram diet was significantly higher than that with 0 or 1 x 10(6) IU vitamin A per kilogram supplementation (P < 0.05). Vitamin A deficiency (0 IU/kg) significantly elevated the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reductase (GR) in the viscera of abalone (P < 0.05). In muscle, the effects of vitamin A deficiency on SOD and GPX activities were the same as those in viscera, however, the activity of GR significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Vitamin A deficiency significantly decreased the ratio of CAT to SOD (catalase/superoxide dismutase) in viscera (P < 0.05). Nevertheless, it significantly decreased the ratio of GR to GPX in muscle (P < 0.05). Compared with the supplement of 1 x 10(3) IU vitamin A per kilogram, excessive vitamin A (1 x 10(6) IU/kg) had no significant effects on the activities of CAT, SOD and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) (P > 0.05), but significantly elevated GPX and GR activities in viscera (P < 0. 05). In muscle, the activities of CAT, SOD, GPX, GST and GR were significantly decreased by the excessive dietary vitamin A supplement (P < 0.05). Compared with the supplement of 1 x 10(3) IU vitamin A per kilogram, vitamin A-excessive had no significant effect on the value of ratio of CAT to SOD either in viscera or in muscle (P > 0.05). The ratio of GR to GPX was significantly decreased in viscera, but significantly elevated in muscle in the vitamin A-excessive group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, optimum supplement of vitamin A (1 x 10(3) IU/kg) was beneficial for abalone to maintain maximum growth and antioxidant system. Hypo- or hyper-vitaminosis A would decrease growth and the efficiency of scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) of abalone.",

With a 3 x 2 factorial design, three levels of dietary lipid (1.59 %, 3.95 % and 6.83 %, respectively) and two water temperatures (17 degrees C and 23 degrees C) were set. After a 100-day feeding trial, results showed that compared with 6.83 % and 1.59 %, 3.95 % of dietary lipid significantly increased the weight gain ratio (WGR) and daily increment in shell length (DISL) of abalone. Compared with 17 degrees C, 23 degrees C of water temperature increased WGR of abalone. Both of dietary lipid level and water temperature play main effects on WGR and a significant interaction was observed. Dietary lipid level plays a main effect on DISL. 3.95 % of dietary lipid level significantly increased trypsin activities in intestine under two water temperatures. Compared with 17 degrees C, 23 degrees C of water temperature significantly increased the activities of trypsin and Na+-K+-ATPase in intestine of abalone in 1.59 % of dietary lipid level. Dietary lipid level plays a main effect on trypsin activity. Water temperature plays a main effect on activities of trypsin, amylase and Na+-K+-ATPase. The 6.83 % of dietary lipid level decreased survival and cumulative mortality after Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection. Compared with 17 degrees C, 23 degrees C of water temperature significantly decreased survival and increased cumulative mortality, where both dietary lipid level and water temperature play a main effect. 6.83 % of dietary lipid level significantly decreased respiratory burst activity, blood cell count and acid phosphatase activity. Compared with 23 degrees C, 17 degrees C of water temperature significantly increased respiratory burst activity, blood cell count, activities of lysozyme and acid phosphatase. Dietary lipid level significantly affected respiratory burst activity, blood cell count and acid phosphatase activity. Water temperature significantly affected respiratory burst activity, blood cell count and activities of lysozyme and acid phosphatase, and a significant interaction between dietary lipid level and water temperature on respiratory burst activity and blood cell count was observed. The 6.83 % dietary lipid level up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines expression which was associated with Perilipin2/TLR-s/MyD88/IRAK4/(NF-kappa B or AP-1) signaling, down-regulated relative gene expression of anti-oxidative enzymes which was related to Keap1/Nrf-2 signaling, up-regulated caspase-3 and caspase-7 expression which was related to JNK/(Bcl2 and Bax) signaling, down-regulated ATG101, Beclin-1 and LC3 expression and decreased LONP, HSP70 and HSP90 expression which was related to HSF-1/Sirt3 signaling. Compared with 17 degrees C, 23 degrees C of water temperature up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines expression which was related to activating Perilipin2/(NF-kappa B or AP-1) signaling, down-regulated mRNA levels of antioxidative enzymes which was related to inhibiting Keap1/Nrf-2 signaling, up-regulated caspase-3 expression which was related to Bcl2/Bax signaling, down-regulated ATG101, Beclin-1 and LC3 expression, down-regulated expression of LONP, HSP70 and HSP90 which was related to inhibiting HSF-1/Sirt signaling. Taken together, 3.95 % of dietary lipid level at 23 degrees C of water temperature increased growth performance and decreased immune function of abalone, while 3.95 % of dietary lipid level at 17 degrees C showed the opposite trend. It is suggested that when the lipid level (3.95 %) in diet is appropriate, a relatively lower water temperature (17 degrees C) is more suitable for the health of Pacific abalone H. discus hannai.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.742013

All aquaculture experiments were conducted at The University of Melbourne, Australia. Artificial feed was supplied ad libitum to the fed group, and no feed was supplied to the starved group. A modified metabolite extraction protocol using deuterated solvents was developed for H-1-NMR-based metabolite profiling of digestive gland in response to the short-term feeding/starvation experiment, to avoid lyophilisation prior to biochemical analysis. PLS-DA revealed that fed and starved abalone are metabolically distinct from each other after 28 and 56 days. After 28 days, the fed group was defined by an increase in arginine, glucose, glutamate, glycine, inosine and uracil (P < 0.05), and the starved group was defined by an increase in N,N-dimethylglycine. After 56 days, the fed group still displayed increased glucose (P < 0.05), while N,N-dimethylglycine remained elevated in the starved group (P < 0.05). Arginine and glycogen were all higher at 28 days compared to 56 days, suggesting decreased anaerobic energy production at the later time point. Only glucose and N,N-dimethylglycine were significantly different between the fed and starved groups after 56 days, suggesting that abalone had not acclimatised to the starvation treatment after 28 days. These results infer N,N-dimethylglycine is a robust marker for short-term starvation in abalone. H-1-NMR was also conducted on the artificial feed and starved abalone faecal matter, revealing the biochemical differences between them and digestive gland tissue. These methodology and results will facilitate a deeper understanding of the nutritional and physiological requirements of abalone in an aquaculture setting.",10.1007/s10499-015-9941-4

The Ca-pantothenic acid was microbound with sodium alginate. and other water-soluble vitamins were encapsulated with sodium alginate, by an emulsion coacervation process, prior to supplementation in experimental diets. The dietary Ca-pantothenic acid concentration did not affect the body composition of abalone. Weight gain (WG), daily increment in shell length (DISL), and tissue pantothenic acid were significantly affected by dietary pantothenic acid. According to broken-line regression analysis, 21 mg Ca-pantothenic acid/kg diet was found to satisfy the maximum growth of abalone. whereas on the basis of the pantothenic acid concentration in the viscera and muscle of the experimental abalone, 24 and 26 mg Ca-pantothenic acid/kg diet were required, respectively. Hence, the optimum dietary Ca-pantothenic acid requirement for H. discus hannai Ino is estimated to be 26 mg/kg diet.",

The results showed that compared with 30.49% of dietary protein, 17.64% and 43.27% of dietary protein levels significantly decreased the weight gain rate and the activities of a-amylase, trypsin, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in the hepatopancreas and serum of abalone (P < 0.05). Abalone fed 30.49% of dietary protein had the highest activity of superoxidase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, lysozyme and the total anti-oxidative capacity, and the lowest content of malondialdehyde in the serum and hepatopancreas (P < 0.05).

In this study, three novel C1qDC proteins were identified from the disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) transcriptome database and designated as AbC1qDC1, AbC1qDC2, and AbC1qDC3. The cDNA sequences of AbC1qDC1, AbC1qDC2, and AbC1qD0 consisted of 807, 1305, and 660 bp open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 269, 435, and 220 amino acids (aa), respectively. Putative signal peptides and the N-terminal gC1q domain were identified in all three AbC1qDC proteins. An additional predicted motif region, known as the coiled coil region (CCR), was identified next to the signal sequence of AbC1qDC2. The genomic organization of the AbC1qDCs was determined using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library. It was found that the CDS of AbC1qDC1 was distributed among three exons, while the CDSs of AbC1qDC2 and AbC1qDC3 were distributed between two exons. Sequence analysis indicated that the AbC1qDC proteins shared <40% identity with other counterparts from different species. According to the neighbor joining phylogenetic tree, the proteins were grouped within an invertebrate group with high evolutionary distances, which suggests that they are new members of the C1qDC family. Higher expression of AbC1qDC1 and AbC1qDC2 was detected in hepatopancreas, muscle, and mantle tissues compare to the other tissues analyzed, using reverse transcription, followed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) using SYBR Green, whereas AbC1qDC3 was predominantly expressed in gill tissues, followed by muscles and the hepatopancreas. The temporal expression of AbC1qDC transcripts in gills after bacterial (Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes) and lipopolysaccharide stimulation indicated that AbC1qDCs can be strongly induced by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species with different response profiles. The results of this study suggest that AbC1qDCs are involved in immune responses against invading bacterial pathogens. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.fsi.2016.07.010

In a 12-week study, the effects of age, water temperature and dietary protein levels on digestive enzyme activity in greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) were investigated. One-and 2-year old abalone were fed diets with crude protein (CP) levels from 24 to 36% (18.0-28.6% digestible protein) and cultured at 14, 18 and 22 degrees C. Diets were formulated to be isoenergetic (12.5 MJ kg(-1) digestible energy) and isolipidic (3.6% crude lipid). Trypsin, alpha-amylase and lipase activities were measured, and were influenced differently by abalone age, water temperature and dietary protein levels. Lipase and alpha-amylase activities significantly increased as water temperatures were raised. In contrast, trypsin activity was not affected by water temperature. Trypsin activity of 2-year old abalone was significantly lower (53%) than that of 1-year old abalone. The alpha-amylase activities of 1-year old abalone were significantly up-regulated as dietary protein levels increased. In contrast, 2-year old abalone down-regulated alpha-amylase activity by 55% when fed 33% CP, compared to abalone fed 30% CP. The significant trypsin activity down-regulation in 2-year old abalone compared to 1-year old animals provides further support to reducing dietary protein for 2-year old abalone to optimise cultured greenlip abalone production. Significantly higher alpha-amylase activity in 1-year old abalone as starch levels were reduced indicates a compensatory effect in abalone fed carbohydrate deficient diets. Further research is recommended to optimise the protein to energy ratio for different age classes of greenlip abalone, especially when fed high dietary protein levels.

However, due to a paucity of genetic information, such as transcriptome resources, our un-derstanding of their stress adaptation is restricted. In this research, using single-molecule long-read (SMRT) sequencing technology, a library composed of ten tissues (i.e., haemocytes, gills, muscle, hepatopancreas, digestive tract, mantle, mucous gland, ovary, testis and head) was constructed and sequenced. In all, 41,855 high-quality unique transcripts, among which 24,778 were successfully annotated. Additionally, 13,463 SSRs, 1,169 transcription factors, and 18,124 lncRNAs were identified in H. discus hannai transcriptome. Furthermore, multiple immune-related transcripts were identified according to KEGG annotation, and a portion of these transcripts were mapped into several classical immune-related pathways, including the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Additionally, 24 typical sequences related to the immunity pathway were detected by RT-PCR; the results showed that most of the immune-related genes showed signifi-cantly high expression at 72 h after bacterial challenges and thermal stress, especially the expression level of genes in gills was significantly higher than that in haemocytes under V. parahaemolyticus stress at 24 h. At the same time. The analysis of alternative splicing identified several innate immunity-related functions genes, including CD109 and caspase 2.

Abalone (40-50 g individual(-1)) were fed seven isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets. Three diets contained 5, 10 or 19% soya, while an additional three diets included graded levels of ISO. A fishmeal (FM)-only diet was included. The inclusion of ISO did not influence gonad development or abalone growth while soya inclusion level had an effect on both reproductive development and abalone growth.

However, knowledge regarding invertebrate galectins is still in its infancy. With the intention of filling the knowledge gap, here we identified a quadruple domain-containing galectin from marine invertebrate disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus (AbGalec), and characterized it. AbGalec consisted of four distinct carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) and lacked a signal peptide. Expression analysis revealed AbGalec to be ubiquitously expressed in all the examined early embryonic stages of abalone, with highest expression in the 16-cell stage, suggesting the importance of AbGalec in early developmental processes. Tissue distribution analysis revealed the highest expression of AbGalec in abalone mantle, followed by that in gills and hemocytes. Immune challenge experiments revealed significant upregulation of AbGalec at 24 h and 48 h post injection (p.i.) with bacterial and viral components. These results suggested the possible involvement of AbGalec in host defense mechanisms. Polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) injections were capable of inducing AbGalec transcript expression more prominently than bacterial stimulants, thus providing evidence for its role in viral infections. We determined the virus-neutralizing ability of a quadruple domain-containing galectin for the first time, by analyzing the downregulation of VHSV transcripts during the overexpression of AbGalec. Significant downregulation of VHSV transcripts was observed after 24 h and 48 h of post infection.

No difference in proximates of the soft body of abalone was observed. The cumulative mortality of abalone fed the Undaria was higher than all formulated diets at 84h until the end of the 4-day post observation after 24-h air exposure. Abalone fed the UA0 diet showed higher mortality than other formulated diets at 84h until the end of the 4-day post observation. In conclusion, U. pinnatifida could be completely replaced with U. australis in abalone feed. The best growth was obtained in abalone fed the UA60 diet.",10.1007/s10811-018-1654-4

To enhance the viability of cultivating H. kamtschatkana for commercial and restoration purposes, more information is needed on the optimal macroalgal diet that maximizes abalone growth and nutrition. This study compares the suitability of two commonly cultivated species of macroalgae as feed: Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp), a kelp with relatively low protein content, and Devaleraea mollis (Pacific dulse), a rhodophyte with comparatively high protein content. Fifty H. kamtschatkana specimens, with a mean shell length of 45.25 +/- 4.26 mm, were collected from the wild and fed either S. latissima, D. mollis, or an alternating diet of the two for 28 wk. Feed consumption was measured weekly, whereas shell length and weight change were recorded every 2 mo. Despite consuming significantly more S. latissima than D. mollis (P < 0.001, H. kamtschatkana showed no significant difference in specific growth rate (SGR) (P = 0.775) or linear growth rate (LGR) (P = 0.746) among the diets. Feed conversion efficiency (FCE) was significantly higher for D. mollis than S. latissima (P < 0.001), although there was no significant difference in protein efficiency ratio (PER) (P = 0.129). Proximate composition analyses of abalone tissue showed no significant difference in protein, lipid, carbohydrate, or caloric content across macroalgae diets. Additionally, sexual dimorphism was observed, with females exhibiting significantly higher daily feed consumption (DFC) (P = 0.001), SGR (P = 0.003), and LGR (P = 0.001) than males. These results indicate that whereas both macroalgae species are suitable as feeds for H. kamtschatkana cultivation, the benefits of a D. mollis diet are less pronounced compared with other commercially cultivated abalone species. This study provides actionable insights for those interested in cultivating H. kamtschatkana for commercial or restoration purposes and adds to our understanding of an environmentally and culturally important species in the Northeast Pacific Ocean.",10.2983/035.044.0103

One thousand and eighty juvenile abalone were randomly distributed into 18,100 L net cages (sixty per cage). Five formulated diets were prepared. Twenty percent U. pinnatifida was included into the control (Con) diet. Twenty five, 50, 75 and 100% U. pinnatifida were substituted with an equal amount of OEB, referred to as the OEB25, OEB50, OEB75 and OEB100 diets, respectively. Finally, dry U. pinnatifida was prepared to compare formulated diets on growth performance of abalone, referred to as the Undaria. Each diet were randomly assigned to triplicate groups of abalone and fed to abalone once a day to satiety with little leftover for 16 weeks. After the 16-week feeding trial, abalone were subjected to air exposure for 24 h and survival was monitored for the next 4 days. Weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone fed all formulated diets were greater than those of abalone fed the Undaria. The greatest weight gain and SGR were obtained in abalone fed the OEB50 diet, followed by the OEB75, OEB25, Con and OEB100 diets, in that order. Weight gain and SGR of abalone fed the OEB100 diet were lower than those of abalone fed the Con diet. Shell length, width and height and soft body weight of abalone tended to agree with growth rate of abalone. No difference in the chemical composition of the soft body of abalone was observed.

The full-length cDNA of HdhHSP90 was of 2660 bp, including an open reading frame (ORF) of 2187 bp encoding a polypeptide of 728 amino acids with predicted molecular weight of 84.134 kDa and theoretical isoelectric point of 4.619. BLAST analysis revealed that HdhHSP90 shared high similarity with other known HSP90s, and the five conserved amino acid blocks defined as HSP90 protein family signatures were also identified in HdhHSP90, which indicated that HdhHSP90 should be a cytosolic member of the HSP90 family. The expression levels of HdhHSP90 in haemocytes and hepatopancreas were measured by real-time PCR after Pacific abalone were fed with semi-purified diets containing graded levels of selenium (0.15, 1.32 and 48.70 mg Kg(-1)) for 20 weeks, respectively. The results showed that the expression levels of HdhHSP90 transcript were significantly up-regulated and reached the maximum (0.47-fold) in hepatopancreas of Pacific abalone fed with optimal dietary Se (1.32 mg Kg(-1)) (p < 0.05). However, these levels significantly decreased in hepatopancreas at the excessive dietary Se (48.70 mg Kg(-1)) (p < 0.01). In haemocytes, the expression of HdhHSP90 mRNA increased and reached the maximum (0.96-fold) at the excessive dietary Se (48.70 mg Kg(-1)) (p < 0.01). It is implied that the expression levels of HdhHSP90 could be affected by dietary Se in hepatopancreas and haemocytes, and HdhHSP90 was potentially involved in the anti-oxidation responses in Pacific abalone H. discus hannai.

Diatom density and juvenile Haliotis laevigata growth, survival and behaviour were monitored. In contrast to N. jeffreyi, growth of Cocconeis sp. was not inhibited in low light (< 200 lx), however, the density of both species increased in high light (800 lx). Juvenile H. laevigata growth rates were strongly correlated to the density of N. jeffreyi but not to the density of Cocconeis sp. Juvenile growth rates did not differ between diatom species or shading condition. A reduction in the photophobic behaviour of juvenile H. laevigata was observed in shaded aquaria, suggesting that abalone are not strictly nocturnal feeders. Results demonstrate the importance and effect of light intensity on the growth of diatom species and the growth, survival and behaviour of juvenile H. laevigata. Results also show that light intensity for diatom culture and husbandry of juveniles in a hatchery needs to be considered carefully. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The meat quality of abalone is affected by diet and temperature, and this in turn directly influences consumer acceptance of abalone products and financial returns to producers. The aim of this study was to investigate the impacts of diet (Gracilaria lemaneiformis vs artificial feed) and water temperature (low, 19 degrees C and high, 27 degrees C) on growth performance, nutritional value, flavor, and sensory quality of abalone. The results showed that artificial feed led to increases in growth, content of body protein, total free amino acids (TAA), delicious amino acids (DAA), volatile compounds (alcohols, acids, aromatic compounds, and esters), and sensory quality (hardness) of abalone meat. High temperature significantly decreased the growth, body moisture, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and hardness but increased the contents of DAA, TAA, alcohols, acids, and ar-omatic compounds in abalone meat. Our study suggests that high temperature significantly decreases the growth and nutritional value of abalone muscle but does provide a different mouthfeel and flavor for consumers, and nutrition-balanced artificial feed as the diet at a low water temperature maximizes the growth of abalone without sacrificing meat quality. The results may help to formulate an optimal feed strategy for farming industries throughout the abalone culture period, thereby allowing farmers to harvest premium quality abalone and elevate the market value of abalone products.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739241

The hybrid abalone (Haliotis discus hannai female x H. fulgens male, DF) and backcrosses are cultured on a large scale due to their high survival rates under heat stress in summer. The thermal resistance of purebreds, hybrid F-1 and backcross populations were evaluated through Arrhenius break temperature (ABT) of cardiac performance in this study. The results showed that the hybrid F-1 had the best thermal resistance, and the ABT gradually decreased with the increase in recurring number. In addition, a growth experiment of DD x DF (H. discus hannai female x DF male) populations showed that DD x DF-Y (presence of black spots in the visceral mass of DD x DF) grew faster than DD x DF-N (absence of spots in the visceral mass of DD x DF) (p < 0.05), but the ABT of DD x DF-Y was lower than that of DD x DF-N (p < 0.05). The results suggest that the presence or absence of black spots in the visceral mass could be used as a breeding trait for the thermal resistance and growth of backcross abalone.

These diets were the red alga Palmaria palmata, which had been grown in seawater enriched with two levels of ammonia-N and contained a protein content of either 41% (High-N) or 3 2% (Low-N) and the brown alga Laminaria saccharina (23% protein). A significantly different response to the macroalgal diets by the two sea urchin species was found in terms of food consumption rate, food conversion efficiency, gonadal growth and gonad nutritional composition. P miliaris was able to efficiently utilise the High-N P palmata, whereas P lividus exhibited a higher food conversion efficiency (FCE) and specific growth rate (SGR) when fed the Low-N compared with the High-N P palmata. P miliaris had a significantly higher food consumption rate and higher gonad index (GI) compared with P lividus, irrespective of diet type. The lowest FCE, SGR and GI were shown by both species fed L. saccharina. No interspecific difference in gonadal nitrogen content was observed, although a positive relationship was shown between dietary and gonadal nitrogen content for both species. All three macroalgal diets produced bright orange or yellow orange gonad colour in P lividus. High-N and Low-N P. palmata improved gonad colouration in P miliaris compared with L. saccharina. The results suggest that P. miliaris can efficiently assimilate high protein plant-based diet, whereas P. lividus is less capable of benefiting from high dietary protein levels and this should be taken into consideration when culturing this species either in land-based or sea-based polyculture systems.

Summer mortality likely involves complex interactions between biological, environmental, husbandry and nutritional factors; however, this is poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a case-control study for farmed greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) and hybrid abalone (H. laevigata x Haliotis rubra) to identify risk factors associated with summer mortality. Farm mortality data from 2015 to 2021 were used to identify tanks which fit the case definition and tanks that did not. We constructed a model to predict summer mortality risk using logistic regression and forward variable selection. Modelling considered 61 potential risk factors (examples included water quality, husbandry, climate, biology). The final selected model including six main effects and five two-way interactions. Except for maximum water temperature in the week prior to the case/control date, all parameters selected in the final model were involved in one or more interactions. The model identified interactions between age and each of previous year summer mortality, size when removed from weaning tanks and feed rate. There were also interactive effects of previous year summer mortality and size when removed from weaning tanks, and of feed rate and post-grading mortality. The risk of summer mortality was two times more likely for every 2 & DEG;C increase in maximum weekly water temperature. Post-grading mortality was associated with an increased risk of summer mortality, but relative risk decreased at higher feed rates. Risk of summer mortality in younger abalone increased with higher feed rates, while increasing feed rates for 30-month abalone had no effect on the risk of summer mortality. Abalone in tanks which experienced summer mortality the previous year were at a higher risk of summer mortality regardless of age. For abalone that did not experience summer mortality the year prior, the subsequent risk of summer mortality increased with abalone age. Improved understanding of summer mortality risk factors may help guide management strategies and future research to advance abalone aquaculture.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739928

To examine the circadian expression pattern of orexin receptor type 2 (OX2R) and its potential effect on the feeding behavior of abalone, the coding region sequence of OX2R that is 1215 bp in length and encodes 404 amino acids was first cloned using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique. A recombinant expression vector was constructed for H. discus hannai based on the OX2R protein, obtaining a recombinant protein with a molecular weight of 46 kDa. Polyclonal antibody was prepared with the purified recombinant protein used as the antigen, and the antibody titer of >= 512 K was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression levels of OX2R determined using western blotting were highest in the intestinal tract (P < 0.05), but they were not significantly different from the levels in the pedal. Immunofluorescence experiments affirmed that OX2R was widely expressed in the columnar cells of the intestinal mucosal epithelium. To further account for the relationship between the onset of feeding behavior and the expression level of OX2R in abalone, the circadian expression characteristics of OX2R were analyzed by dissecting the intestinal tissues after three days of normal feeding and fasting and following the refeeding treatment. The expression levels of OX2R in the refeeding group were significantly higher than those in the normal feeding and fasting groups at any time point (P < 0.05). The cosine curve analysis revealed that the expression levels of OX2R lost rhythmicity after fasting. Based on the quantification of behavioral data for abalone after fasting and refeeding, the cumulative movement distance and movement duration in each group followed a significant cosine rhythm (P < 0.05), which is consistent with abalone's nocturnal ecological habits. However, the cumulative movement distance and movement duration in the fasting group were significantly lower than those in the normal feeding and refeeding groups (P < 0.05). The peak phases of the cumulative movement distance and movement duration in the refeeding group (ZT08:22 and ZT08:44) shifted backward compared to the normal feeding group (ZT07:33 and ZT07:39). The above results first identified the structural characteristics and circadian expression patterns of OX2R in the marine mollusk abalone, which may reveal the molecular mechanism behind the generation of a feeding rhythm in marine nocturnal organisms and serve as a tool helping to maintain the diversity of marine benthic resources.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.12.313

In some invertebrates, heat shock proteins (HSPs) are immune effectors and have been described as potent activators of the innate immune response. Several diseases have become a threat to abalone farming worldwide; therefore, increasing disease resistance is considered to be a long-term goal for breeding programs. A trait will respond to selection only if it is determined partially by additive genetic variation. The aim of this study was to estimate the heritability (h(2)) and the additive genetic coefficient of variation (CVA) of HSP70 as a component of innate immunity of the abalone Haliotis rufescens, in order to assess its potential response to selection. These genetic components were estimated for the variations in the intracellular (in haemocytes) and extracellular (serum) protein levels of HSP70 in response to an immunostimulant agent in 60 full-sib families of H. rufescens. Levels of HSP70 were measured twice in the same individuals, first when they were young and again when they were pre-harvest adults, to estimate the repeatability (R), the h(2) and the potential response to selection of these traits at these life stages. High HSP70 levels were observed in abalones subjected to immunostimulation in both the intracellular and extracellular haemolymph fractions. This is the first time that changes in serum levels of HSP70 have been reported in response to an immune challenge in molluscs. HSP70 levels in both fractions and at both ages showed low h(2) and R, with values that were not significantly different from zero. However, HSP70 induced levels had a CVA of 13.3-16.2% in young adults and of 2.7-8.1% in pre-harvest adults. Thus, despite its low h(2), HSP70 synthesis in response to an immune challenge in red abalone has the potential to evolve through selection because of its large phenotypic variation and the presence of additive genetic variance, especially in young animals.",10.1371/journal.pone.0141959

Abalone artificial diets generally include fishmeal, limiting their utilization in ecologically sustainable aquaculture and affecting abalone quality and acceptance by the consumers. A six month feeding trial was conducted to assess the nutritional value of four different dried seaweed meals: Ulva lactuca (Chlorophyta), Gracilaria cornea (Rhodophyta), Laminaria digitata (Phaeophyta) and Palmaria palmata (Rhodophyta), as ingredients to all-vegetable-based formulated feeds for abalone Haliotis tuberculata coccinea (33.1 +/- 0.8 mm and 4.7 +/- 0.6 g). A mixed fresh algae diet of G. cornea and U. Ulva rigida, reared in an Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) system, served as control. Survival rates were very high (95-98%), regardless of the diet fed. Enriched fresh algae produced a significantly higher growth for H. tuberculata coccinea (169% weight gain) than all the artificial diets (49-84% WG). Comparison among abalone fed the different formulated diets showed that the inclusion of P. palmata improved growth, condition index and dietary protein utilization. On the contrary, the use of L. digitata markedly reduced the efficiency of dietary protein since the protein-related nutritional index (PER), the percentage of protein deposited in the foot muscle as well as the meat to shell ratio recorded for animals fed this diet were the lowest, despite a higher feed intake. Large differences were found in the FA profile of fresh algae as compared with the three formulated diets. The n-3/n-6 ratio was much higher in the fresh algae and, consequently, in the foot tissues of abalone fed this diet in comparison to the one of those fed the formulated ones. The elevated contents of 20:4n-6 in the abalone fed the experimental diets and 20:5n-3 in abalone fed the fresh algae, as well as their respective metabolites, suggest that abalone have the ability to desaturate and elongate LA to ARA and ALA to EPA.

In the current study, two selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidases (AbSeGPxs) that shared 54.3% identity were identified from the disk abalone Haliotis discus discus. The open reading frames (ORFs) of AbSeGPx-a and AbSeGPx-b coded for 222 and 220 amino acids, respectively, with a characteristic selenocysteine residue encoded by an opal stop codon (TGA). The conserved selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element was predicted in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of both isoforms, and they were found to form two stem-loop structures. Amino acid comparison and phylogenetic studies revealed that the AbSeGPxs were closely related to those in other mollusk species and were evolutionarily distinct from those of other taxonomic groups. The SYBR Green qPCR was employed in investigating the transcripts of AbSeGPxs. The expression of AbSeGPxs mRNA was examined in different embryonic developmental stages and differential expression patterns for AbSeGPx-a and AbSeGPx-b were noted. Meanwhile, the highest expression of AbSeGPxs was detected in the hepatopancreas of healthy adult animals. Next, transcriptional levels were profiled in hemocytes of adults to determine the immune responses of AbSeGPxs to microbial infections. The results revealed the significant up-regulation of AbSeGPx-a in a time-dependent manner after bacterial (Listeria monocytogenes and Vibrio parahaemolyticus) and viral (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus) infections. Consequently, these findings indicate that AbSeGPx-a and AbSeGPx-b might be involved in the embryonic development of disk abalone and the regulation of immune defense system of adult animals.

Additionally, the temporal expression of AbMnSOD in different abalone tissues in response to bacterial, viral, and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) stimuli was investigated. SOD activity was measured at various recombinant protein concentrations via the xanthine oxidase/WST-1 system. Cell viability upon exposure to H2O2, wound healing ability, and subcellular localization were determined in AbMnSOD-transfected cells. AbMnSOD was 681 bp long and contained the SOD-A domain. AbMnSOD expression was higher at the trochophore stage than at the other stages. When challenged with immune stimulants, AbMnSOD showed the highest expression at 6 h post-injection (p.i.) for all stimulants except lipopolysaccharides. In the gills, the highest AbMnSOD expression was observed at 6 h p.i., except for the Vibrio parahaemolyticus challenge. Recombinant AbMnSOD showed concentration-dependent xanthine oxidase activity. Furthermore, AbMnSOD-transfected cells survived H2O2-induced apoptosis and exhibited significant wound gap closure. As expected, AbMnSOD was localized in the mitochondria of the cells. Our findings suggest that AbMnSOD is an essential antioxidant enzyme that participates in regulating developmental processes and defense mechanisms against oxidative stress in hosts.",10.1016/j.dci.2021.104299

Analysis of the borehole positions on shells of H. rubra showed that they were significantly concentrated in the area where the abalone muscle is attached. This is in sharp contrast to other drilling predators of molluscs. The whelks did not change their choice of drilling site in response to experimental removal of the shell surface, or to changes in shell thickness. They may use shell ridges and possibly the morphology of the abalone shell to determine where to drill, The behaviour of the prey appears unlikely to affect the drilling position, and shell repair by the abalone is too slow to act as an effective defence in any area. The area over the muscle is the thickest part of the shell covering abalone tissue, and requires a much longer time to penetrate, as drilling is slow. The cost of drilling through the thicker part of the shell is presumably outweighed by the benefits gained from feeding on the muscle tissue. The muscle tissue has a higher energy content than the visceral tissue found elsewhere, especially when measured per unit volume.",10.1071/MF9950647

The first experiment was set up to determine if nutrient levels used for co-culture of the Rhodophyte, Pacific dulse (Palmaria mollis) directly affected abalone growth. No significant differences (ANOVA; P = 0.117) were found in growth of abalone cultured in either ambient seawater alone or seawater supplemented with different NaNO3 loads (1176,1765,2353, and 2942 muM day(-1) NO3-N), NaH2PO4 (83.3 muM day(-1) PO4-), and a modified version of Guillard and Ryther's [Gran. Can. J. Microbiol. 8, (1962) 229]f medium containing Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Mo, and Co. The second experiment was designed to determine the effect of different nutrient levels on the nutritional value of R mollis when fed to abalone. P mollis was cultured with different NaNO3 loads (1176, 1765, 2353, and 2942 muM day(-1) NO3-N) and NaH2PO4 (83.3 muM day(-1) PO4-) in the presence or absence off medium trace metals (Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Mo, and Co). H. discus hannai showed the highest LGR and SGR when fed on P. mollis supplemented with nitrate loads ranging from 1176 to 2353 muM day(-1) NO3-N. In contrast, H. rufescens showed the highest linear growth rate (LGR) when fed on P. mollis supplemented with higher nitrate loads of 2353 to 2942 muM day(-1) NO3-N, while nitrate load had no significant effect on specific growth rate (SGR). Both abalone species grew better on P. mollis supplied with 0.75f + Zn (day(-1)) metal solution [Gran. Can. J. Microbiol. 8 (1962) 229] compared to those without trace metal additions, with H. discus hannai showing a further improvement in food conversion efficiencies (FCE). The present work shows that understanding and manipulating the culture environment of P. mollis can significantly affect growth, FCE, and daily food consumption (DFC) of H. discus hannai and H. rufescens.

"Dyck, M; Roberts, R; Jeffs, A","Assessing alternative grazing-tolerant algae for nursery culture of abalone, Haliotis iris",2011,AQUACULTURE,320,1-Feb,62,68,,"Feeding during the nursery stage of abalone aquaculture, from larval settlement to 10 mm in shell length (SL), is a major challenge in the intensification of abalone aquaculture. Commercial abalone nurseries typically settle larvae onto vertical plastic plates coated with algae that act as a settlement cue and an important post-settlement food source. It becomes increasingly difficult to maintain an adequate algal food supply as the abalones grow and for this purpose many nurseries use the alga, Ulvella lens, as it is a very effective settlement cue as well as offering a resilient food source for the developing abalones. However, juvenile abalones can deplete a film of diatoms on the plates before they are capable of ingesting U. lens, and once abalone reach similar to 5 mm SL the high grazing pressure may exceed even what U. lens can support, requiring nurseries to provide additional cultured algae or prematurely wean the juveniles onto manufactured diets. Three prospective microfilamentous algal species isolated from the tanks of a commercial abalone facility, were selected as potentially suitable nursery algae as they demonstrated resistance to intensive juvenile grazing pressure, displayed rapid vegetative growth, and could be triggered to mass sporulate as a means of rapidly coating nursery tanks. The current study involved two experiments and assessed the suitability of each species as a live algal feed for juvenile abalones compared to U. lens. These experiments measured: (1) ingestibility and grazing resistance of each alga against juvenile abalone 1-8 mm SL, and (2) the ability of each species to recover once grazers had been removed. Two algae (Ulvophyceae sp. 1 and 3) demonstrated the desirable properties of being easily grazed by abalones of a smaller size (average SL 2.33 mm and 2.20 mm respectively) than U. lens (2.89 mm) yet provide an algal film that is likely to be resilient and durable under grazing pressure. These algae also displayed significantly greater rates of recovery following grazing than U. lens (p<0.01), an important attribute for restoring algal films in nursery systems between grazing events or between batches of juvenile abalones. The results of this study indicate that these novel algae have a combination of desirable characteristics for use in commercial abalone nurseries. Further experiments in commercial scale nursery systems should be pursued to assess the food value and performance of these species as a feed for juvenile abalones. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This study examined the effect of three probiotic candidates (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens MA228, Enterobacter ludwigii MA208, and Pediococcus acidilactici MA160) on the growth and survival rates of juvenile abalone, Haliotis asinina L). The three probionts were incorporated as a mixture of two or three onto Gracilaria sp. and fed to juvenile abalone for 62 days. Then, specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and survival rate (SR) were measured. The results showed that the increments in weight and length were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the abalone that received a mixture of probionts. While feed conversion ratio (FCR) was significantly lower than the control. The supplementation of B. amyloliquefaciens MA228 and E. ludwigii MA208 (2P) in the Gracilaria sp. resulted in an increase of 9% SGR in terms of weight and decreased FCR value 0.2 unit, compared with the control. However, there was no difference in the survival rates between the mix of 2 and 3 probionts, > 72% among the treatments and control. Our study shows that the growth of juvenile abalone could be improved through probiotic supplementation.

Abalones (initial body weight: 15.88-16.54 g; initial shell length 41.70-42.40 mm) were fed nine isoenergetic (similar to 16.08 kJ/g) and isolipidic (similar to 42.0 g/kg) experimental diets with 93.5, 116.9, 151.1, 191.8, 230.3, 275.9, 320.3, 360.5 and 405.9 g/kg protein contents, respectively. Results showed that the optimal dietary protein level for H. discus hannai was determined as 259.4 g/kg through second-order polynomial regression analysis for weight gain rate (WGR). Serum TP and urea nitrogen levels were significantly increased when dietary protein levels were higher than 320.3 g/kg (p < .05). The highest gene expressions of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3 K), target of rapamycin (mTOR) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6 K) in muscle were found in the treatment with 275.9 g/kg of dietary protein. The excessive dietary protein level (405.9 g/kg) significantly decreased the gene expression of S6 K. Meanwhile, abalone fed with 275.9 g/kg of dietary protein exhibited the highest microbial diversity in intestine as measured by Chao richness and Shannon diversity index. In conclusion, dietary protein level reduced from 259.4 g/kg to 154.0 g/kg or increased from 259.4 to 323.0 g/kg, the WGR of abalone might be depressed with 5% likelihood.

The high water temperature in the middle of the summer season frequently limits the aquaculture productivity of abalone. To cope with the problem, this study aimed to investigate viability, attachment rate, changes of immune response, and physiological properties of juvenile small abalone Haliotis diversicolor aquatilis against high water temperature stress under (CO)-C-60-gamma irradiation-mediated hormetic effects. To examine physiological changes of abalone, the gamma-ray irradiated and non-irradiated groups were distinguished by grouping a total of 70 abalones in a treated group and a control group (each group included twenty-five female and ten male abalones). The treated group was exposed to (CO)-C-60-gamma irradiation using a designed experimental apparatus, the control group was not. Our results revealed that the low level of gamma ray (20 Gy)-irradiated Haliotis diversicolor aquatilis showed a 100% survival rate during the experiment. After gamma ray exposure, all the abalones were cultured without feeding and bioactivities were measured to examine gamma ray-induced physiological responses. The results suggested the potential for selective breeding using gamma ray irradiation hormesis to manipulate the number of eggs, fertilization rate, hatching rate, and attachment rate. The shell length of juvenile abalone was significantly enhanced by a 20 Gy radiation dose. We could presume that the effect of hormesis in the gamma-ray irradiation parent shellfish also had a genetic effect on the offspring. In order to verify changes in immune response and stress tolerance of abalone under high temperature stress, lysozyme activity and survival rates were compared at a water temperature of 30 degrees C. Interestingly, the Co-60 gamma ray-irradiated abalones exhibited almost a 1.65-fold enhanced survival rate along with reduced lysozyme activity after 12 h of high temperature stress. Our results speculate that low levels of Co-60 gamma ray-mediated hormetic effects can be an effective strategy for shell length growth and high temperature stress tolerance.",10.3390/jmse8110906

Growth and fatty acid composition of the muscle tissue were compared to that of abalone fed a reference diet that contained no added lipids (0.25% total lipids). After 75 days of culture in a flow-through system, no significant differences in growth were found among abalone fed the different oil types. Responses to different dietary levels of lipid were significantly different but not to sources of oils. Maximum growth was achieved at a 1.5% inclusion of oil sources. It appears that abalone have a great capacity to synthesize lipid from carbohydrate sources. Results also suggest that abalone are capable of desaturation and elongation of 18 C polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of the n - 3 and n - 6 family to 20:5n - 3 and 20:4n - 6. Synthesis of 22:6n - 3 from 20:5n - 3 is not reflected in the results. The lack of a growth response to the different levels of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) provided by the different oils included in the experimental diets may be due to an insufficient duration of the experiment to achieve an essential fatty acid deficiency. The relationship between fatty acid profiles of tissue and the diets fed to the abalone suggests that metabolic activity of the gut microflora is not a source of essential fatty acids.

In the current study juvenile H. midae were exposed for one month to two constant temperatures (14 degrees C and 19 degrees C), with three oxygen levels (82%, 98% and 126% oxygen saturation) at each temperature. One additional treatment was included at 19 degrees C, 126% oxygen, where feed was supplemented with L-proline. The results presented here suggest that long-term 19 degrees C exposure is more stressful to H. midae juveniles than a 14 degrees C exposure of the same duration, since exposure to higher temperature generally resulted in higher activities of the antioxidant enzymes measured but lower total antioxidant capacities. Haemolymph glucose levels responded to oxygen treatment at the 14 degrees C exposure, but the same response was not initiated in the 19 degrees C treatment, possibly because the animals exposed to the 19 degrees C treatment relied on proteins to a larger extent. Increased oxygen levels at the 19 degrees C treatment did not cause more DNA damage or protein carbonylation compared to lower oxygen levels. Supplementing feed with L-proline at the high temperature/high oxygen treatment caused a decrease in haemolymph haemocyanin (which may exhibit catalase function) content and a slight decrease in some of the antioxidant enzyme activities, while maintaining the same total antioxidant capacity compared with the same treatment where feed was not supplemented. The overall DNA integrity profile also changed with proline-supplementation, as did the induction level of hsp70. When projecting tissue growth over a 12 month period under these conditions, we estimate that H. midae juveniles in this study may exhibit a significant increase in mass when their feed was supplemented with L-proline, indicating that L-proline supplementation provides some benefit to the individual. It might therefore warrant conducting long-term growth trials on land-based mariculture facilities to further investigate its potential benefit to the mariculture industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A brown epiphyte, Myrionema strangulans, causes a disease of the Ulva, which is currently managed by farmers by restocking. The main potential threat is that some farmers are wary of integrated systems, fearing they may promote disease in abalone, although Ulva has been grown in abalone effluent and fed back to the abalone on one farm for 6 years without adverse effects. Opportunities exist for the expansion of Ulva cultivation via further spread of the abalone industry, the inclusion of seaweed raceways in proposed fish-farming activities, or the potential for the inclusion of high quality cultivated Ulva as a constituent in aquafeed.

In this study, we characterized two ferritin homologues in the red abalone Haliotis rufescens, a species of economic importance for Chile, USA and Mexico. Two ferritin subunits (Hrfer1 and Hrfer2) were cloned. Hrfer1 cDNA is an 807 bp clone containing a 516 bp open reading frame (ORF) that corresponds to a novel ferritin subunit in H. rufescens. Hrfer2 cDNA is an 868 bp clone containing a 516 bp ORF that corresponds to a previously reported ferritin subunit, but in this study 5'- and 3'-UTR sequences were additionally found. We detected a putative Iron Responsive Element (IRE) in the 5'-UTR sequence, suggesting a posttranscriptional regulation of Hrfer2 translation by iron. The deduced protein sequences of both cDNAs possessed the motifs and domains required in functional ferritin subunits. Expression patterns of both ferritins in different tissues, during different developmental stages, and in response to bacterial (Vibrio splendidus) exposure were examined. Both Hrfer1 and Hrfer2 are most expressed in digestive gland and gonad. Hrfer1 mRNA levels increased about 34-fold along with larval developmental process, attaining the highest level in the creeping post-larvae. Exogenous feeding is initiated at the creeping larva stage; thus, the increase of Hrfer1 may suggest and immunity-related role upon exposure to bacteria. Highest Hrfer2 expression levels were detected at trochophore stage; which may be related with early shell formation. Upon challenge with, the bacteria an early mild induction of Hrfer2 (2 h post-challenge), followed by a stronger induction of Hrfer1 at 15 h post-challenge, was observed in haemocytes from adult abalones.

We observed that exposure to 2.5 mg O-2 L-1 resulted in marked reductions in assessed shell parameters, average meat weight, and survival compared with exposure to 4 and 8 mg O-2 L-1. There were also significant reductions in oxygen consumption and ammonia-N excretion in abalone exposed to 2.5 mg O-2 L-1. We also detected initial immunosuppression in the 2.5 mg O-2 L-1 -treated abalone, as evidenced by a significant reduction in total hemocytes and inhibition of antibacterial and lysozyme activities. Furthermore, intracellular malondialdehyde concentrations were significantly elevated at 1 month in the 2.5 mg O-2 L-1 treatment group, whereas there were reductions in the levels of glutathione and enzymatic activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase, thereby indicating potential hypoxia-induced oxidative stress and a depression of antioxidant capacity. After 4 months of treatment, severe hypoxia (2.5 mg O-2 L-1) had significantly modulated all measured parameters, whereas exposure to 4 and 8 mg O-2 L(-1 )had induced no significant effects. Collectively, our observations indicate that under long-term exposure to hypoxia, Pacific abalone failed to maintain an effective antioxidant defense system and adequate immunity, with the observed biochemical disruptions leading to a reduction in growth and survival.",10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105596

Larvae sourced from the hatchery-bred (HB) and wild-sourced (WS) broodstock were fed with either diatoms (TMT1-NF), agar-bound microparticulate diet (TMT2-A-MPD), or a combination of both feeds (TMT3-NF + A-MPD) in six 2-m(3) tanks replicated over time. Three hundred thousand veliger larvae were stocked/tank containing 80 corrugated plates with mucus trails hanging on bamboo poles. Feeds were given at 0900 h starting at day 3 with seawater flow through introduced every 1400 h starting day 5. Two-way analysis of variance determined significant differences (p < 0.05) in survival and shell length between larval sources and feed types. Tukey's post hoc test established differences among treatment means. At day 30, survival for HB- and WS-sourced larvae was significantly higher (42%) in TMT3 compared with TMT2 having 35% for HB and 38% for WS (p < 0.05). Larvae fed with TMT1 had significantly lowest survival among the three treatments. Survival at 60 and 90 days did not show significant difference for TMT2 and TMT3 regardless of broodstock source. Post-larval shell growth (90 days), from both sources fed with TMT2 and TMT3, was significantly higher than TMT1 (p < 0.05). Larval performance did not show any significant interactions between HB and WS broodstock. The use of A-MPD alone or in combination may elicit improvement in survival and shell length growth in abalone larvae regardless of larval sources. A-MPD may be used as full or partial replacements to diatoms as alternative food for abalone post-larvae in large-scale culture.",10.1007/s10499-017-0110-9

Results indicate that U. armoricana is an important dietary ingredient for gonad production, accounting for an average of 37.33 +/- 1.03% of the isotopic signal recorded for gonads at the end of the growth trial. This is significantly more than fish meal and soya, which only contributed an average of 11.40 +/- 1.81 and 3.80 +/- 0.09%, respectively, of the isotopic signal of the gonads. Maize and wheat each account for almost 25% of all the dietary ingredients used to formulate the feeds, but their relative contribution to gonad production only averaged 8.55 +/- 0.58 and 3.80 +/- 0.05%, respectively, among the diets. This indicates that, at least for gonad development, these ingredients may not be required at such high levels. These findings support previous data on the importance of Ulva in abalone and urchin diets, and demonstrate the value of stable isotope analysis for assessing the contribution of specific dietary ingredients in new feed formulations, particularly where growth of specific tissues is being investigated.",10.1111/anu.12979

To explore the potential roles of invertebrate IKKs on immunity, three IKK encoding genes have been identified from molluscan species disk abalone and designed as AbIKK1, AbIKK2 and AbIKK3 at the transcriptional level. Coding sequences of AbIKK1, AbIKK2 and AbIKK3 encode the peptides of 746, 751 and 713 amino acids with the predicted molecular mass of 86.16, 86.12 and 81.88 kDa respectively. All three AbIKKs were found to share conserved IKK family features including the kinase superfamily domain (KD), ubiquitin-like domain (ULD), and alpha-helical scaffold/dimerization domain (SDD), similar to their mammalian counterparts. Under normal physiological conditions, AbIKKs were ubiquitously detected in six different tissues, with the highest abundance in the digestive tract and gills. Temporal transcriptional profiles in abalone hemocytes revealed the induction of AbIKK1, AbIKK2, and AbIKK3 expression following exposure to Gram-negative (Vibrio parahemolyticus) and Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes) bacteria, viruses (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, VHSV), LPS, or poly I:C. The overexpression of AbIKKs in HEK293T or RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells induced NF-kappa B promoter activation independent of stimulation by TNF-alpha or LPS. Moreover, iNOS and COX2 expression was induced in AbIKK transfected RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells and the induced state was maintained post-LPS treatment. Furthermore, mRNA levels of three selected cytokine-encoding genes (IL-1 beta, IL6, and TNF-alpha) were found to be elevated in abalone IKK overexpressed RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells, both with and without LPS exposure. Overall, our findings demonstrated that AbIKKs identified in this study were positively involved in eliciting innate immune responses in abalone. In addition, the data revealed the presence of an evolutionarily conserved signaling mechanism for IKK mediated NF-kappa B activation in mollusks.",10.1016/j.fsi.2020.04.029

L-ascorbyl-2-molyphosphate (LAMP) was added to the basal diet to formulate four experimental diets containing 0.0, 70.3, 829.8 and 4967.5 mg AA equivalent kg(-1) diets, respectively. Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of adult abalone in acrylic tanks (200 L) in a flow-through seawater system. Each tank was stocked with 15 abalone. Animals were fed once daily (17:00) to apparent satiation for 24 weeks. The results showed that the dietary AA (703 mg kg(-1)) could significantly up-regulate the expression levels of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), feritin (FT) and heat shock protein 26 (HSP26) in the hepatopancreas of abalone in this treatment compared to the controls. However, the expression levels of Mn-SOD, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx), selenium-binding protein (SEBP), HSP70 and HSP90 were significantly down-regulated. Compared with those in the group with 70.3 mg kg(-1) dietary AA, the expression levels of CAT, GST and HSP26 were decreased in abalone fed with very high dietary AA (4967.5 mg kg). In addition, significant up-regulations of expression levels of Mn-SOD, GPX, TPx, SEBP, FT, HSP70, HSP90 and NF-kappa B were observed in abalone fed with apparently excessive dietary AA (829.8 and 4967.5 mg kg(-1)) as compared to those fed 70.3 mg kg(-1) dietary AA. These findings showed that dietary AA influenced the expression levels of antioxidant proteins, heat shock proteins and NF-kappa B in the hepatopancreas of abalone at transcriptional level. Levels of dietary AA that appeared adequate (70.3 mg kg(-1)) reduced the oxidative stress by influencing gene expression of antioxidant proteins, but excessive dietary AA (829.8 and 4967.5 mg kg(-1)) induced oxidative stress in Pacific abalone H. discus hannai.

Dried macroalgae meals are promising ingredients for abalone diets. In this 92-day study, the growth, feed utilisation and digestive enzyme activities of greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata; 2.89 g) fed dried macroalgae meals (Ulva sp. meal or Gracilaria cliftonii meal) in formulated diets were investigated. Seven experimental formulated diets, a basal diet (0 % diet) and three inclusion levels of Ulva sp. meal (5, 10 and 20 % inclusions) and Gracilaria sp. meal (5, 10 and 20 % inclusions) were used. Diets were formulated to contain 35 % crude protein, 5 % crude lipid and 17.5 MJ kg(-1) gross energy. A commercial diet was also fed to abalone and compared with the 0 % diet. Growth and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of abalone fed the 0 % diet and commercial diet were similar. Abalone fed 5 % Gracilaria sp. meal or Ulva sp. meal exhibited superior growth to abalone fed 0 %. However, increasing dietary Gracilaria sp. meal inclusions (> 10 %) led to further growth improvements but impaired protein and energy retentions. In contrast, abalone fed > 10 % Ulva sp. meal inclusions exhibited similar growth to those fed 0 and 5 % Ulva sp. Although Ulva sp. and Gracilaria sp. meals are currently not commercially viable, this study clearly demonstrates the potential to develop abalone feeds with inclusions of dried macroalgae meal. We recommend a dietary inclusion of 10 % Gracilaria sp. meal or 5 % Ulva sp. meal to improve abalone growth.",10.1007/s10811-016-0829-0

Abalone fed Con, CS20, and CS40 had a higher feed efficiency and protein efficiency ratio than abalone fed CS100 diet, although there were no significant differences among abalone fed Con, CS20, CS40, CS60, and CS80. Abalone fed CS100 had a lower whole-body crude lipid content than did abalone fed Con. Broken-line analysis for WG indicated that dietary SWP was successfully replaced by CS up to 74.8%.

The level of crude protein ranged from approximately 26% to 44% while the energy content remained constant at about 4.1 kcal g(-1). Growth ranged from 3.63 to 12.33 mg day(-1). The growth of abalone fed the 100 and 108 diets was significantly greater than that of each of the other diets. Protein efficiency ratio increased as the dietary protein content increased except for the T108 diet (44% crude protein). Abalone apparently consume food to satisfy an energy requirement. Caloric expenditure due to metabolism was estimated for abalone fed diets with protein ratios of 62, 85, 100. Energy loss due to respiration did not vary appreciably among abalone fed the different diets. The proportional distribution of dietary energy into fecal, digestible, growth, and metabolic energy was estimated for abalone fed these diets. Apparent dry matter digestibility was among the lowest for abalone fed the 100 P:E diet, but growth of abalone fed this diet was significantly higher than that of each of the other treatments except the 108 diet. Unexplained energy loss to achieve balance ranged from 7% to 28.5%, some of which is probably due to differential mucus and ammonia production.

Although seven STAT members have been reported in mammals, very limited information on STAT genes in molluscans is available. In this study, we identified and characterized a STAT paralog that is homologous to STAT5 from the disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus, and designated as AbSTAT5. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence for AbSTAT5 (790 amino acids) with other counterparts revealed conserved residues important for functions and typical domain regions, including the N-terminal domain, coiled-coil domain, DNA-binding domain, linker domain, and Src homology 2 (SH2) domains as mammalian counterparts. Analysis of STAT phylogeny revealed that AbSTAT5 was clustered with the molluscan subgroup in STAT5 Glade with distinct evolution. According to the genomic structure of AbSTAT5, the coding sequence was distributed into 20 exons with 19 introns. Immunologically essential transcription factor-binding sites, such as GATA-1, HNF, SP1, C/EBP, Oct-1, AP1, c-Jun, and Sox-2, were predicted at the 5'-proximal region of AbSTAT5. Expression of AbSTAT5 mRNA was detected in different stages of embryonic development and observed at considerably higher levels in the morula and late veliger stages. Tissue-specific expressional studies revealed that the highest level of AbSTAT5 transcripts was detected in hemocytes, followed by gill tissues. Temporal expressions of AbSTAT5 were analyzed upon live bacterial (Vibrio parahemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes), viral (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus), and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (lipopolysaccharides and Poly I:C) stimulations, and significant elevations indicated immune modulation. These results suggest that AbSTAT5 may be involved in maintaining innate immune responses from developmental to adult stages in the disk abalone. Further, this study provides a basis for structural and functional exploration of STAT members in the invertebrate JAK/STAT signaling pathway. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Results had shown that survival rate, weight gain rate and shell length increase rate were lowest for Se-0.60 group (p < 0.05). The concentration of selenium in the whole body generally increased with increasing level of dietary organic selenium (p < 0.05).

In the digestive gland, the TLR-MyD88-dependent and TLR-MyD88-independent signaling pathways were suppressed by dietary AA supplementation. The mRNA levels of beta-defensin and arginase-I in the digestive gland were significantly increased by dietary AA. In the gill, only the TLR-MyD88-dependent signaling pathway was depressed by dietary AA to reduce inflammation in abalone. The level of mytimacin 6 in the gill was significantly upregulated by dietary AA. After Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection, the TLR signaling pathway in the digestive gland was suppressed by dietary AA, which reduced inflammation in the abalone. In terms of anti-oxidation, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities, as well as total anti-oxidative capacity and reduced glutathione content in CFH, were all significantly upregulated. The malondialdehyde content was significantly downregulated by dietary AA. The anti-oxidative capacity was improved by triggering the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway in abalone.

The blacklip abalone Haliotis rubra was rarely eaten on most reefs, but aggregations of the starfish were found feeding on abalone at some times and places where other suitable prey were scarce. Where abalone were eaten, a higher proportion of small abalone were eaten than larger ones. Starfish preferred small abalone to mussels of the same weight in laboratory choice experiments, and the time required for the starfish to eat mussels and abalone of the same size were similar. Previously unobserved aspects of the escape response of abalone may explain the variable rate of predation on abalone by C. calamaria. Abalone displayed various behavioural responses to attack that increase the likelihood of escaping. One response apparently involves the production of a chemical deterrent in the abalone epithelium. It appears that as a result abalone are not often eaten unless mussels stocks are depleted and the starfish are al high densities. This is most likely on offshore reefs where abundant mussel recruitment in most years sustains large numbers of C. calamaria.",10.1080/10236249509378925

This factor greatly affects crucial biological process such as feeding rates, energy balance, physiological stress status, and consequently, growth and survival of farmed abalone. Most of these effects have been studied in the economically valuable abalone Haliotis discus hannai. The use of specific photoperiods, and/or light qualifies and intensifies, have been proposed as managing strategies to increase its production; however, for extensive off-shore or in intensive land-based farming systems, lighting conditions are not likely to be easily managed. Despite the great importance of the biological responses to the light/dark stimuli for abalone farming production, to the best of our knowledge the genetic control upon the variation associated behavioral traits have not been studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the heritable variation and potential responses to selection for the phototaxis [i.e., displacement towards (positive) or against (negative) the light source] and locomotion behaviors associated to the intensity of the response (i.e., crawling speed and displacement distance) to the light/dark stimuli in juvenile H. discus hannai. Genetic and phenotypic correlations between these traits were also estimated. Results showed moderate but significant heritable variations for phototaxis (h(2) = 0.15) and locomotion responses (h(2) = 0.18-0.37); and significant positive genetic correlations among them. Expected gain responses to selection per generation (with a selection intensity of 2.06, i.e., selecting 5% of the individuals from a population) were moderate for phototaxis variation (16%) and high for locomotion responses variation (33-67 or 36-73%, depending on the model used for the estimations). As a consequence, the potential for reducing (or incrementing, depending on the breeding goal) the reactivity or the sensibility to the light stimulus by selective breeding is good, and can be an attractive way of indirectly improving growth, survival and general welfare of farmed H. discus hannai.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.10.065

In this study, the effects of three graded levels of dietary protein (35, 41 and 47 %) and 15 % dietary supplementation of dried and ground Ulva lactuca on the digestion and excretion processes in juvenile Australian hybrid abalone (Haliotis rubra x H. laevigata) were investigated through analysis of metabolic oxygen consumption (M(center dot)O2 ) and nitrogen excretion (M(center dot)NH4+-N) during meal digestion and assimilation. Trials were conducted at three farm-relevant acclimation temperatures (12, 17 and 22 degrees C), and abalone acclimated to the highest temperature were additionally subjected to a simulated heatwave. Within the ranges of 35 and 47 % dietary crude protein, no differences were observed in total postprandial energy use, however, significant differences were observed between the three temperatures. Similarly, differences in nitrogen excretion were observed across temperatures but not across dietary protein treatments. Dietary supplementation of U. lactuca led to significantly higher peak and total M(center dot)O2 throughout the postprandial period at 22 degrees C. Additionally, total NH+4 -N excretion was higher at 17 degrees C when abalone were fed the U. lactuca supplemented diet. No differences in survival were observed between any of the dietary treatments when juvenile abalone underwent the simulated heatwave, however, the 15 % U. lactuca treatment did exhibit consistently higher M(center dot)O2 .

"Dyck, M; Roberts, R; Jeffs, A",USE OF ALGAL DIETS TO AID EARLY WEANING IN THE ABALONE HALIOTIS IRIS,2010,JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH,29,3,613,620,,"A major bottleneck in the aquaculture of abalone is feeding during the nursery stage of production, from larval settlement to approximately 10 mm in shell length (SL). Most commercial abalone nurseries settle larvae onto vertical plastic plates coated in a film of algae that acts as a settlement cue and an important postsettlement food source. As abalone grow, their food consumption increases exponentially, and it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain an adequate supply of algal food. Even grazing-resistant algae, like Ulvella lens, are often depleted when abalone reach 3-5 mm SL, requiring nurseries to provide additional algae or to wean the juveniles prematurely onto manufactured diets. Early weaning typically results in slower growth and higher mortality relative to live algal feeds. The current study tested various algal species to aid early weaning of the abalone Haliotis iris. Two experiments were conducted pairing nursery tanks of similar environmental conditions to test a total of three algal treatments: (1) the benthic diatom Nitzschia longissima, (2) a film of N. longissima and U. lens, and (3) a film of N. longissima and a naturally occurring mixture of green algal species that remained on weaning tank surfaces after a previous cohort of abalone had been harvested from the tank. Algae were established prior to the introduction of juvenile (SL, 2-7 mm) H. iris at a density of 15,000-30,000 abalone per tank (2.5 m(3) water volume, 13 m(2) surface area). The abalone were raised to approximately 15 mm SL with twice-weekly supplementary feeding of suspended N. longissima during the first 4 wk, and the addition of manufactured feed 3 times a day for the duration of the experiment. The N. longissima films were completely removed by grazing within 4-5 days whereas the green algal films persisted for 60-120 days. Despite the difference in resilience of algal films, there was no significant difference (P>0.05) in abalone performance between treatments 1 (98.7% survival, growth of 85 mu m/day) and 2(98.3% survival, growth of 92 mu m/day). In a second experiment, treatment 2 provided slightly greater growth than the mixed algal film of treatment 3 (101 mu m/day vs. 96 mu m/day, P = 0.034), but survival rates were similar (98.2% vs. 98.3%, P = 0.86). All 3 algal treatments offer practical and effective means of weaning H. iris onto manufactured feeds at an SL of more than 3 mm. However, both treatments 1 and 3 can be established more rapidly than U. lens and are therefore likely to be more efficient for commercial weaning of H. iris and potentially for other species of abalone.",10.2983/035.029.0309

In this study, we investigated immune responses in gill, hepatopancreas and haemolymph of mussels (Perna canaliculus Gmelin, 1791) following experimental infection with Vibrio sp. DO1 (V. coralliilyticus/neptunius-like isolate). Significant differences in metabolite profiles and metabolic responses between tissues were observed. Overall, haemolymph and gills shared common metabolic responses characterized by increases in itaconic acid and decreases in other amino acids (e.g., BCAAs, lysine, tryptophan) and fatty acids (e.g., DHA, EPA, palmitoleic acid). Increases in itaconic acid, decreases in fatty acids, and increases in amino acids were found in hepatopancreas tissues. The alterations of these metabolites suggest osmotic stress, oxidative stress, changes in amino acid metabolism and protein synthesis in the immune system of P. canaliculus caused by Vibrio sp. infection. Interestingly, the accumulation of itaconic acid in all three tissues of infected mussels suggests that this metabolite has an important role in the mediation of bivalve antimicrobial activities and immune responses.

Abalone consumed three phenolic-poor algal species, Laminaria sinclarii (Harvey) Farlow, Macrocystis pyrifera Agardh, and Nereocystis luetkeana Postels et Ruprecht (mean phenolic content = 0.52% dry mass), at a greater rate than two phenolic-rich species, Dictyoneurum californicum Ruprecht and Cystoseira osmundacea Agardh (mean phenolic content = 4.60% dry mass). This inverse relationship between phenolic content and consumption rate also existed after the algae were macerated and the liquid portion of the blended slurry incorporated in agar discs. However, the correlation between grazing rate and phenolic content improved in this latter experiment, thus suggesting that abalone grazing was deterred significantly by the morphology of L. sinclarii and, to a lesser extent, of M. pyrifera.

A better antibacterial activity against nine selected pathogen bacteria was recorded in twig essential oil, and the selected pathogens of both Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were sensitive to the leaf and twig essential oils in the present study. No antibacterial activity was recorded in the hot-water extracts of leaf and twig. In challenge trial, a significant decrease of sensitivity to V. alginolyticus (1 x 10(6) cfu shrimp(-1)) was found in that of shrimp received hot-water extract from twig at the levels of 2 mu g g shrimp I compared to control. In addition, the how-water extract of twig in vitro showed greater enhanced effects on phenoloxidase activity, respiratory burst and phagocytosis of white shrimp compared to the hot-water extract of leaf. It is considered that the extracts of stout camphor tree could be a candidate to replace the chemo-therapeutants through the inhibitory effects against the growth of pathogens, and enhanced effects on shrimp immunity and disease resistance.

The practical diets contained graded levels of protein from fish meal, shrimp meal, and soybean meal at 22 (diet 1), 27 (diet 2), and 32% (diet 3) with corresponding estimated metabolizable energy values of 3254, 3150, and 3090 kcal ME/kg diet. The amino acid profile and proximate analyses of muscle meat of the test animal and published nutrient requirements of other species of Haliotids were used as a basis for formulating and developing these practical diets. The diets were fed to abalone at 2-5% body weight once daily (1600 h) for biological evaluation in terms of weight gain (WG), increase in shell length (SL), specific growth rate (SGR), protein efficiency ratio (PER), feed conversion ratio (FCR) and for physical evaluation in terms of shell coloration of the animal. Natural food, Gracilariopsis bailinae (17% CP/2200 kcal ME/kg) (NF) fed ad libitum served as the control. Better growth rates, in terms of WG and SL, FCR and PER were noted in abalone fed the three formulated diets compared with those fed seaweed, G. bailinae. Abalone fed diets 3 (WG: 347%; SGR: 0.81; SL: 140%) and 2 (WG: 307%; SGR: 0.70; SL, 139%) showed significantly better growth rate than those fed diet 1 (WG: 252%; SGR: 0.51; SL: 132%). Natural food-fed abalone had the lowest WG (134%), SGR (0.06) and increase in SL (77%). Survival was generally high at 85-95% for all treatments. FCR (1.5-2.3) and PER (2.19-2.47) for animals fed the three diets were significantly better than for those fed natural food (0.10 PER and 6.98 FCR). Regression analysis showed the optimum protein level for juvenile abalone to be 27% with an energy level of 3150 kcal/kg ME. Abalone juveniles fed the formulated diets produced shells with light bluish green color while those fed seaweed retained the original brown color.

A feeding trial was designed to cover a full reproductive cycle in young adult green abalone, Haliotis fulgens, consisting of five diet treatments: the macrophytic algal phaeophyte Egregia menziesii, rhodophyte Chondracanthus canaliculatus, chlorophyte Ulva lobata, a composite of the three algae and a starvation control. The lipid class. fatty acid, sterol and 1-O-alkyl glyceryl ether profiles were determined for foot, hepatopancreas/gonad tissues and larvae. The major fatty acids were 16:0. 18:0. 18: 1 (n-7)c, 18: 1 (n-9)c, 20:4(n-6), 20:5(n-3) and 22:5(n-3), as well as 14:0 for abalone fed brown and red algae. 4,8,12-Trimethyltridecanoic acid, derived from algae, was detected for the first time in H. fulgens (hepatopancreas complex, 1.2-13.9%; larvae. 0.5% of total fatty acids). Diacylglyceryl ethers were present in larvae (0.6% of total lipid). The major 1-O-alkyl glycerols were 16:0, 16:1 and 18:0. Additionally, 18:1(n-9) was a major component in hepatopancreas/gonad and larvae. The major sterol was cholesterol (96-100% of total sterols). Highest growth rates were linked to temperature and occurred in abalone fed the phaeophyte E. menziesii (43 mum(.)day(-1), 56 mg(.)day(-1) yearly mean), an alga containing the highest levels of C-20 polyunsaturated fatty acids and the highest ratio of 20:4(n-6) to 20:5(n-3). This study provides evidence of the influence of diet and temperature on seasonal changes in abalone lipid profiles, where diet is most strongly related to body mass and temperature to shell length. The allocation of lipids to specific tissues in green abalone clarifies their lipid metabolism. These results provide a basis for improving nutrition of abalone in mariculture through formulation of artificial feeds. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

With a rapid decline in wild abalone fisheries, farming now dominates the abalone export market in South Africa. Kelp (Ecklonia maxima) constitutes the major feed for farmed abalone in South Africa, but this resource is now approaching limits of sustainable harvesting in kelp Concession Areas where abalone farms are concentrated. This paper gives an overview of the development of the South African abalone industry and analyses how abalone farming, natural kelp beds and seaweed harvesting are interlinked. It discusses options and constraints for expanding the abalone industry, focussing especially on abalone feed development to meet this growing demand. Kelp will continue to play an important role as feed and kelp areas previously not utilised may become cost-effective to harvest. There are many benefits from on-farm seaweed production and it will probably be a part of future expansion of the abalone industry. Abalone waste discharges are not at present regarded as a major concern and fanning brings important employment opportunities to lower income groups in remote coastal communities and has positive spillover effects on the seaweed industry and abalone processing industry.

Urchins fed a diet containing casein showed the highest values of body protein content, protein efficiency ratio and apparent net protein utilization. The energy availability and digestibility of the diet having crystalline amino acids showed the lowest values. The diet with casein and sodium alginate showed a higher growth rate, lower feed efficiency and lower protein retention than the diet with casein and Curdlan.

First, we analyzed locomotion and the hiding behaviour of 60 4-year old individuals; then we described their feeding on either dispersed or concentrated algae. The results show that each individual, independently of its sex, adopts one of two locomotion strategies, behaving as either a wanderer (W) or a sedentary (S). Ws covered longer distances, occupied larger areas, and made more twisted trajectories than Ss. Ws and Ss also differed for their social behaviour (the nearest neighbour distance was longer for Ws), the use of hides (Ws occupied the hides, particularly their inner spots, more often), food recruitment (Ws were quicker in responding to the food odour and foraged for longer time), and competitive ability (Ws more often displaced other individuals from food patches).

The hybrid abalone (Haliotis discus hannai 9 x H. fulgens a, DF), is one of the main varieties of abalone cultured in Fujian Province, China, to resist the high temperature. In this study, the high-temperature resistance of DF abalones was assessed under 28 degrees C - 32 degrees C. 31 degrees C was applied in the subsequent screening experiments of high-temperature resistant individuals. A total of 614,321 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified via super genotyping-by-sequencing (S-GBS), and 69 SNPs involved in 42 candidate genes were identified by genome-wide association study (GWAS). In addition, according to gene functional annotation, the locus with the lowest P value was screened within the threshold range (- log10 P = 4.98296). The genotyping was verified by Sequenom MassARRAY, and 7 SNPs were proved to be related to high temperature resistance in DF population of 100 individuals. 7 candidate genes (fabp, e3rglg4, rgs2, tanc2x6, osbp1, arsb, and uch1) were identified near these SNPs. Finally, these candidate genes were further proved to be associated with the hightemperature resistance trait of DF by the analysis of differential expression genes between sensitive and tolerant individuals. These candidate genes involved regulatory mechanisms such as cell stability, protein repair, lipid metabolism and immune regulation. Notably, the mechanism by which the e3rglg4 gene was involved in the degradation of abnormally folded proteins of abalone under heat stress, corroborating the reliability of the results of GWAS and Sequenom MassARRA. These results complement the shortage of molecular markers for heat resistance of hybrid abalone, provide a reference for marker-assisted selection (MAS) and accelerate the development of heat-resistant abalone varieties.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739576

In this study, we explored the effect of changing seawater temperature on the foraging and hiding behaviors of the juvenile Pacific abaloneHaliotis discus hannai.First, we tested whether their hiding behavior in response to light differs depending on the temperature (11 degrees C, 14 degrees C, and 17 degrees C) when only artificial shelter was provided. We observed that the abalones hid under the shelter much faster at 17 degrees C than at 11 degrees C. Second, we tested whether their hiding and foraging behaviors changed in response to increasing temperature when both food and shelter were provided. At high water temperature (17 degrees C), abalones emerged more quickly than at low water temperature (11 degrees C), and the total number of feeding abalones was higher at high temperature than that at low temperature. However, the hiding speed in response to light in the morning was not significantly different among different temperatures. These results suggest that although the basic response to a single stimulus (i.e., light or food) was faster at higher temperatures than at lower temperatures, abalones may increase their boldness under higher temperatures when deciding whether to feed or hide.",10.1007/s12601-020-0024-8

This view is challenged by recent laboratory studies which show that marine invertebrate embryos of some nonarthropodan phyla are able to transport and use dissolved organic material (DOM, e.g. amino acids and fatty acids) in seawater as a source of material (energy) for metabolic needs and growth. Here we present results of experiments conducted in situ (in Antarctica and N. Pacific) and in the laboratory, which show that embryos could, in some cases, meet the metabolic costs of embryonic development and increase in organic weight (biomass) prior to being able to feed on particles. Increases in biomass of embryos of temperate species correlated with the timing of spring phytoplankton blooms. In contrast, the biomass of embryos (of temperate species) reared during periods of low primary productivity decreased, or remained constant. Phytoplankters exude DOM into seawater and these exudates are shown here to enhance embryonic growth. In most cases, there was no net use of endogenous reserves during prefeeding development; growth and energy needs were apparently met through consumption of DOM in seawater. We suggest that DOM is an important food source for embryos of soft-bodied marine invertebrates in polar and temperate oceans.",10.3354/meps109173

Grape marc (GM) is a waste byproduct of the winery industry rich in pigments with antioxidant capacity. However, the inclusion of both ingredients can affect the flavor of the meat of abalone and the color of the shell due to different nutritional profiles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the dietary inclusion of IM and GM on the flavor volatile compounds and shell color of the juvenile Haliotis iris in a 165-days feeding trial. Abalone were offered four experimental diets with different levels of IM and GM inclusion and a commercial diet (no IM or GM). Soft bodies of abalone were used to characterize volatile compounds using solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and color changes were analyzed in ground powder of abalone shells using color spectrophotometry 400-700 nm (visible). The results showed 18 volatile compounds significantly different among the dietary treatments. The inclusion of IM did not significantly affect the flavor volatile compounds detected, whereas the inclusion of GM reduced volatile compounds associated with lipid-peroxidation in abalone meat. The inclusion of IM and GM did not significantly affect the lightness nor the yellowness, blueness, redness, and greenness of the ground shells.

Triplicate groups of abalones stored in fifteen plastic baskets were hand-fed one of four experimental diets or dried U. pinnatifida once every other day for 16 weeks. Growth performance of abalone fed SA10 and SA20 diets were comparable to SA0 and U. pinnatifida groups.

This lack of response was caused by chemical suppressants, rather than by lack of stimulatory compounds. Excitatory responses were induced by single, low molecular weight compounds, but these responses were inhibited by suppressants which occur naturally in the muscle fraction. Amino and organic acids were found highly stimulatory to lobsters, but nucleotides and sugars were not. A mixture of monocarboxylic amino acids and dicarboxylic organic acids was much more effective in eliciting behavior than either of the constituents tested alone, at the same overall concentration. Mixtures which combined either ammonium or urea with amino or organic acids significantly reduced behavioral activity caused by these latter substances.

Results showed that 0.99%-1.95% of dietary DHA contents significantly increased the weight gain rate (WGR) in large size of abalone (P < 0.05), while the WGR in small size of abalone was significantly increased by the 0.46%-0.99% of dietary DHA contents (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the survival of abalone among all the six groups (P > 0.05). Based on the WGR, the optimal dietary DHA content for large and small size abalone were estimated to be 1.32% and 0.88%, respectively. Dietary DHA supplementation significantly increased the activities of trypsin and lipase in the intestine, the content of n-ary sumation n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and n-ary sumation n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio in digestive gland in both sizes of abalone (P < 0.05). The total glyceride concentration in the cell-free hemolymph in two sizes of abalone was decreased. In large size of abalone, 1.95%-2.25% of dietary DHA reduced the lipid content in digestive gland. Lipogenic genes in the digestive gland, including sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (srebp-1) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase, were up-regulated in the 0.46%-1.57% DHA group (P > 0.05). The mRNA expression levels of hormone sensitive lipase (hsl) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (cpt-1) of lipolytic genes in the digestive gland were significantly increased in the 0.46% and 0.99% DHA groups, respectively (P < 0.05). In the small size of abalone, the lipid content in digestive gland and soft body decreased significantly in the 1.95% and 2.25% DHA groups, respectively (P < 0.05). Lipogenic genes in the digestive gland, including srebp-1 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, were significantly down-regulated in the 0.99%-1.95% DHA group (P < 0.05). Lipolytic genes in the digestive gland, including hsl and cpt-1, were not significantly different from the control group (P > 0.05). In conclusion, based on the WGR, the dietary DHA requirements for large and small size of abalone were estimated to be 1.32% and 0.88%, respectively.

Abalones (initial weight: 16.19 +/- 0.16 g) were fed with graded levels of dietary phospholipids (0.10 %, 0.30 %, 0.69 %, 1.30 %, 1.83 % and 2.48 %). Results showed that weight gain rate (WGR) were highest in 1.83 % dietary phospholipids level. Based on the quadratic regression analysis for WGR, the optimal dietary phospholipids level for abalone was estimated to be 1.57 %. The contents of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in abalone muscle increased gradually with the increase of dietary phospholipids levels. A total of 25 volatile flavor compounds were detected in the muscle of abalone by gas chromatograph-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS), including 9 aldehydes, 6 esters, 4 ketones, 3 alcohols and 3 hydrocarbons. The content of some volatile flavor compounds with pleasant aroma in the muscle of abalone increased significantly when fed with diets containing 1.83 % and 2.48 % of phospholipids. Lipidomics analysis showed that dietary phospholipids could affect the lipid composition in the muscle by reducing the synthesis and promoting the decomposition of phospholipids. Among 244 differential lipids identified by lipidomics, phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) were the main species, accounting for more than 50 % of them. Partial least squares regression (PLS-R) analysis showed that the changes of volatile flavor compounds in the muscle of abalone was strongly related to PCs and PEs. Altogether, the present study suggested that dietary phospholipids can not only improve the growth per-formance and nutritional value of abalone, but also have the potential to improve the flavor quality of abalone.",10.1016/j.aqrep.2023.101567

Competent larvae (10 days old at 16 degreesC) were induced to attach and metamorphose with 2 muM GABA. Post-larvae were either fed diatoms (Nitzschia longissima) or starved. In Experiment 1, post-larvae were starved immediately after metamorphosis for periods of 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 20, 25 and 30 days. Starved post-larvae grew relatively well for several days after metamorphosis despite the absence of food (averages of 10.4 and 17.8 mum shell length (SL) per day after 8 days for two batches). Subsequent growth was minimal, averaging 1.7 and 0.7 mum day(-1) over 6-7 days for the two batches, There was no clear relationship between period of starvation and growth rate when fed. Mean daily growth rate over 3 weeks when fed ranged from similar to 15-22 mum day(-1). However, the duration of starvation did have a significant effect on survival. Survival of post-larvae fed after 1-2 days of starvation was 90-100% after 3 weeks of feeding. Longer starvation periods gave progressively lower survival and post-larvae starved for 30 days all died within a week of being fed. In Experiment 2, post larvae were fed for 3 weeks after metamorphosis, then starved for 0, 3, 7, 14 or 21 days. Growth rates of starved post-larvae averaged only 5-6 mum day(-1) in the first week (vs. 30 mum day(-1) in controls), and later declined to zero. Growth resumed within a week following return to food, but the 14- and 21-day starvation treatments took 2 weeks to reach growth rates comparable to controls. The no-starvation controls and the 3- and 7-day starvation treatments all had > 70% survival over 4 weeks after return to food. Survival in the 14- and 21-day starvation treatments was 15-20%, with almost all mortalities occurring in the first week after return to food. These data suggest that Haliotis iris post-larvae are relatively tolerant of starvation, so abalone farmers have a week or so to remedy food shortages before major post-larval mortality begins.

Shell length (SL) and protein per individual showed a rapid increase after Day 37. Enzyme activity was not detected on Day 7 (0.52 +/- 0.01 mm SL, mean +/- standard error) bur by Day 17 (0.97 +/- 0.02 mm SL), there was detectable activity from all enzymes. This indicates that a suite of enzymes for brown algal feeding is produced even by the postlarval stage. Changes in the total activity of CMCase, alginate lyase, and laminarinase showed a pattern similar to the growth rate, with a rapid increase observed after Day 37 (1.59 +/- 0.04 mm SL). However, specific activities did not show the marked changes evident in the total activities, suggesting that the rapid increase of total activities observed after Day 37 was mainly caused by increased production of digestive enzyme with growth. Despite the negligible contents of cellulose and alginate in food of postlarvae, Days 37 and 46 postlarvae showed strong enzyme activity against these polysaccharides, suggesting that the appearance of enzyme activity during postlarval development does not require the presence of a substrate.",

However, excessive Se can have various toxic effects on aquatic animals. In this study, we performed transcriptome analysis to determine the mechanism by which immunity and growth of abalone are affected by toxic dietary concentrations of Se. Four experimental diets were administered to supplement organic Se at concentrations of 0.00 (Control), 0.15 (Se15), 0.30 (Se30), and 0.60 mg/kg (Se60) to provide 0.16 (insufficient), 0.32 (optimal), 0.44 (super nutritional), and 0.60 mg/kg (toxic) Se concentrations in the diet. After feeding for 100 days, the results of the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that the enriched GO terms of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Se15 and Se30 groups were mainly focused on the cellular components, whereas the GO terms enriched in the Se60 group were mainly related to the metabolism of nutrients and the activities of various enzymes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the DEGs of the Se30 group were mainly enriched in various disease pathways, whereas the DEGs of the Se60 treatment were associated with the metabolism of various nutrients. Further analysis of DEGs showed that toxic dietary concentrations of Se decreased the immunity of abalone by affecting the biosynthesis and metabolism pathways of various nutrients. Additionally, toxic dietary concentrations of Se retarded the growth of abalone by decreasing the expression of various genes associated with shell formation, including lustrin A, perlucin, perlustrin, dermatopontin, chitin synthase, and chitinase as well as the genes associated with muscle production, including collagen, myosin heavy chain, myosin essential light chain, and paramyosin. In conclusion, the mechanism of the decrease of immunity and growth of abalone by toxic dietary concentrations of Se has been preliminary revealed in this study.",10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.101449

GIE time of greenlip abalone was evaluated using a marker diet containing chromic oxide and the total faecal collection technique. Additionally, GIE values were compared from samples collected from abalone that were sampled once only or repeatedly to compare the rigour of each method. GIE time was also assessed using radiography. GIE times were significantly affected by water temperature (P < 0.001) and age (P < 0.05). GIE times decreased for both age classes with increasing temperatures, and the GIE time of 2-y-olds was significantly faster than for 3-y-olds. GIE times never exceeded 60 h. There was no significant effect of either factor on the duration that the marker diet was voided, suggesting that differences in GIE times are due to factors other than the transit of feed through the intestine.

Agar-gel alone was used as a control (0% protein) and a commercial abalone diet, Abfeed (R)-S34 (34% protein), was included as a reference. Abalone that were fed fishmeal and spirulina combined performed best in both weight and shell-length gain (36.87 +/- 2.19 mg and 2.29 +/- 0.05 mm). The growth of agar-fed control animals was worst of all treatments (1.26 +/- 2.03 mg and 0.19 +/- 0.14 mm) and had a markedly reduced survival rate (18.6 +/- 5.5%).

Four diets (a commercial reference and iso-nutrient diets containing fish silage oil, unprocessed rainbow trout viscera or shrimp protein hydrolysate) were evaluated both with and without addition of 2 g kg(-1) dietary formic acid, thus yielding a total of eight treatments, in feeding trials with cultured South African abalone Haliotis midae. Results indicated that inclusion of unprocessed rainbow trout viscera without formic acid decreased production performance of experimental animals, as evidenced by significantly decreased final animal weight and daily weight gain, and significantly increased feed conversion ratio compared to the iso-nutrient control. The decreased production performance was attributed to decreased feed water stability of the diet incorporating untreated trout viscera. Dietary formic acid supplementation partially mitigated the negative impacts of viscera inclusion on production performance of the experimental animals, as seen in significantly higher final animal weight and daily weight gain, and lower feed conversion ratio when compared to non-formic acid-supplemented, viscera-containing diet. However, no beneficial effects on production performance or water stability were found upon formic acid inclusion in diets not containing trout viscera. In conclusion, dietary formic acid can partially mitigate negative impacts on production performance when unprocessed trout viscera are included in formulated abalone diets by improving feed water stability, but the exact mechanism by which this is achieved was not established.",10.1007/s10499-018-0257-z

An assessment of the efficacy of the encapsulation techniques, revealed that despite effective lysine supplementation, H. midae fed semipurified test diets containing encapsulated crystalline L-lysine failed to promote significant improvements in either growth, feed or protein efficiency (P > 0.05). The failure of the crystalline L-lysine to illicit growth and nutritional responses is discussed.",10.1046/j.1365-2095.2002.00204.x

In this study, Haliotis midae fed a kelp diet supplemented with Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain C4 exhibited an increased growth rate compared to abalone fed standard kelp feed both under laboratory and farm conditions. The growth rate of antibiotic-treated H. midae was extremely poor in comparison to abalone that had not been treated with antibiotics when fed an unsupplemented kelp diet, reflecting the importance of gastrointestinal microflora in abalone growth. Alginate Iyase activity in the H. midae digestive tract was significantly higher in abalone fed kelp supplemented with strain C4 compared to abalone fed unsupplemented kelp. Antibiotic-treated abalone incorporated C-14-labelled strain C4 proteins into their tissue. Although most of the radiolabelled bacterial protein was incorporated into the hepatopancreas. incorporation was also observed in the gills, foot, adductor muscle and intestine. Thus, the Pseudoalteromonas strain tested in this study shows tremendous potential for use as a probiotic in abalone aquaculture, particularly with regard to improving the nutritional status and digestibility of the feed and hence, increasing the growth rate of farmed H. midae.

In the natural environment, abalone move and migrate to new sites to escape from disturbances. This is the first study that tested the effect of disturbances on movement and feeding activity of farmed abalone for 6 days post-disturbance. Disturbances were (a) turning over the feeder plate, (b) moving and shaking the feeder plate and (c) briefly lifting the basket containing the abalone out of the water. Abalone in the control treatment were not subjected to disturbance. Activity levels of abalone were elevated in the first 1-2 nights post-disturbance with 2-3 times more abalone appearing on the walls of the baskets and larger numbers on the feeder plate than in the control treatment. Feed uptake was not influenced by treatment. Thus, even minor disturbances resulted in increased activity. As it takes at least 1 year to conduct growth experiments in this slow-growing mollusc, the results provide a motivation for studies of growth and metabolic rate in this species under a range of husbandry conditions, such as regular handling, sorting and moving of abalone.",10.1007/s10499-016-0010-4

In postlarvae of similar to 0.5 mm SL, a rachidian tooth (R), 2 pairs of lateral teeth (L1, L2), and 2-3 pairs of marginal teeth (M) per row were present. Only the number of marginal teeth increased to 12-13 pairs per row by 1.5 mm SL. An additional 2 pairs of lateral teeth (L3. L4) were added progressively from 1.5-2 mm SL. The L5 teeth were added at about 6 mm SL. Postlarvae with < 2 mm SL had strongly curved rachidian and lateral teeth with clearance angles of -15 degrees to 20 degrees. Each tooth had many serrations on the working edges. These structures of the teeth are probably suitable for collecting biofilm components such as extracellular mucus of diatoms. Postlarvae with > 2.5 mm SL had higher clearance angles of 20 degrees to 35 degrees. Serrations on the working edges of rachidian and lateral teeth became progressively shallower. These changes suggest that the teeth are more suitable for grazing substrata to efficiently remove strongly attached diatoms. As abalone grew larger than 2 mm SL, the L3 and L4 teeth became longer than R, L1, and L2. The radula development of H. diversicolor aquatilis shown in this study is similar to that of H. discus hannai. However, it is suggested that the feeding transitions in the postlarval stage occur later in H. diversicolor aquatilis than in H. discus hannai. The morphology of juvenile and adult radula teeth of H. diversicolor aquatilis is clearly distinguishable from that of H. discus hannai. The sizes of L4 and L5 teeth of juvenile and adult H. diversicolor aquatilis were much smaller than L3 teeth, whereas sizes of L3-L5 teeth were not clearly different in H. discus hannai. This difference in radula morphology in juvenile and adult stages suggests that the main food items for juvenile and adult H. diversicolor aquatilis may be different from those of H. discus hannai.",

Two blends of organic acids (1% acetic acid +1% formic acid, and 1% benzoic acid + 1% sorbic acid) and one of organic acid salts (1% sodium benzoate +1% potassium sorbate) were evaluated in South African abalone (23 mm initial mean length), and tested against a negative control and positive control containing 30 ppm avilamycin as antibiotic growth promoter (AGP). Experiments were performed at controlled water temperatures under optimal (Phase 1) and sub-optimal (Phase 2) temperatures. During Phase 1 the organic acid and organic acid salt blends significantly enhanced mass growth rate (both linear weight increase [AGRW] and specific growth rate [SCR]) compared to both controls. Linear length increase (AGRL) was significantly higher than the negative control. SGR was increased by 15.8%-17.9% relative to the negative control; AGRW and AGRL were between 12.9%-22.9% and 11.7%-13.5% higher, respectively. No significant growth enhancement was observed during Phase 2. Avilamycin had no effect on growth and none of the treatments had significant effects on feed conversion ratio (FCR), relative incidence cost (RIC, relative to negative control) or feed intake during either phase. The mode of growth enhancement could not be established; it could not be shown that the acid and salt treatments or the AGP had any effects on intestinal microflora, but possible energy effects of the acids were eliminated as potential mechanism; it is unclear what role gut acidification played in the enhanced growth performance.

Temperature is a crucial environmental factor influencing abalone's physiology and energetics, leading to a change in nutritional requirements. However, feeds are generally formulated to match the nutritional requirements at their optimal temperature. Hence, there is a need to optimise dietary protein levels to match temperature-specific requirements during extreme conditions (winter and summer). Given this, a growth trial evaluating five experimental feeds consisting of graded protein inclusion levels (320, 350, 380, 410, and 440 g center dot kg(-1)) was conducted on subadult hybrid abalone (Haliotis rubra x H. laevigata) at three different temperatures reflecting winter (12 degrees C), summer (22 degrees C), and the annual average water temperature (17 degrees C) for 143 days. At lower water temperature (12 degrees C), there was a marginal improvement in growth performance as dietary protein levels increased from 320 to 440 g center dot kg(-1). However, at higher water temperatures (when the culture water temperature is above 17 degrees C), there was a significant improvement in growth performance as dietary protein levels increased from 320 to 440 g center dot kg(-1) as evidenced by an improved weight gain, specific growth rate, and feed conversion ratio. Furthermore, increasing dietary protein levels did not compromise the nutritional quality of the abalone tissue at all three tested temperatures. Therefore, during periods of higher water temperatures, feeding Australian hybrid abalone with a relatively high dietary protein level (410 g center dot kg(-1)) is expected to result in improved growth, shorter culture duration, and profit maximisation.",10.1155/2023/1676340

Two diatoms, Amphora luciae Cholnoky and Navicula cf, lenzii Hustedt, supported high postlarval growth and survival, especially when supplied in combination. A third species, Nitzschia laevis Hustedt, did not support survival for more than two weeks as a unialgal diet and had limited value in mixed diets. Diatom mixtures were superior to single-species diets as of the first week after settlement. The mixture of N. cf lenzii and A. lucia supported the highest survival, up to 50%, and growth rate up to 36 mu m of shell length per day, reaching a size of 1.4mm 30 days after settlement. The three diatom species contained high levels of total lipids (6.4%-14.5% of dry weight) and fatty acids (16%-22% of lipids); from 39% to 48% of fatty acids were polyunsaturated (PUFA). The three diatoms were richer in n-3 PUFA than in n-6 PUFA.

Both Cu and Zn were effectively accumulated by the abalones from water or macroalgae, but their concentration factors and trophic transfer factors were low due to the regulation of Cu and Zn accumulation. Following waterborne or dietary exposure, the abalones exhibited different accumulation patterns of Cu and Zn. The tissue Zn burden decreased quickly after the initial accumulation, and the incoming Zn was mainly deposited in the viscera. In contrast, the tissue Cu burden increased rapidly and gradually reached a steady state. The abalone muscle exhibited a comparable storage capacity of Cu as the viscera and the accumulated Cu in muscle was mainly derived from the dissolved phase instead of trophic transfer. The feeding and growth of the abalone were not influenced in all the exposure regimes. Moreover, the significant induction of metallothionein indicated that the bioaccumulated metals were actively detoxified. In the metal-exposed abalones, more Cu was distributed into the biologically detoxified fractions (metallothionein-like protein and/or metal-rich granule), whereas no significant subcellular redistribution of Zn was observed. Our study suggested that the abalone may have high endurance to the contamination of Cu or Zn. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.01.002

The full length of HdhGPx cDNA was 963 bp with a 669 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 222 amino acids and a 101 bp eukaryotic selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) in 3' untranslated region (UTR). It was showed that HdhGPx has a characteristic codon at (235)TGA(237) that corresponds to selenocysteine (SeC) as U-72. Sequence characterization revealed that HdhGPx contains a characteristic GPx signature motif 2 ((96)LGLPCNQF(103)), an active site motif (179WNFEKF184). In addition, two potential N-glycosylation sites ((112)NGTE(115) and (132)NLTQ(135)) were identified in HdhGPx. 3D modeling analysis showed that the overall structure of HdhGPx monomer had more similarity to human GPx3 than human GPx1. Relatively higher-level mRNA expression was detected in hepatopancreas, mantle and gonad by real-time PCR assays. The relative expression levels of HdhGPx mRNA in hepatopancreas and haemocytes were detected by real-time PCR in abalone fed with nine different diets containing graded levels of selenium (0.15, 1.32 and 48.7 mg kg(-1)), zinc (6.69, 33.85 and 710.63 mg kg(-1)) and iron (29.17, 65.7 and 1267.2 mg kg(-1)) for 20 weeks, respectively. The results showed that the expressions of HdhGPx mRNA were statistically higher at adequate dietary selenium (1.32 mg kg(-1)), zinc (33.85 mg kg(-1)) and iron (65.7 mg kg(-1)) than those in low dietary minerals, respectively.

In the present study we aimed to describe selected physiological and molecular responses of winter acclimated, cultured H. midae after acute and chronic exposure to 16, 19 and 22 degrees C. During acute (24 h) exposure to 16, 19 and 22 degrees C we found a significant increase in specific rates of oxygen consumption and nitrogen excretion with higher temperature. This corresponded with a higher reliance on proteins to fuel metabolism and coincided with high d-lactate levels at the 16 degrees C and high levels of Hsp70 proteins at all three temperatures. After chronic (1 month) exposure to 16, 19 and 22 degrees C animals compensated for changes in temperature by decreasing their specific oxygen consumption and nitrogen excretion rates with increase in temperature, showing that the animals had a high level of reliance on carbohydrates as food source at 22 degrees C. d-lactate levels were lower than after acute exposure and Hsp70 protein levels were lower at 16 and 19 degrees C, but remained high at 22 degrees C. Total muscle protein levels were lower in 16 and 19 degrees C animals and very high at 22 degrees C, indicating that animals incorporate proteins into their tissue, because they do not rely on protein catabolism to the same extent compared to lower temperatures. We conclude that cold acclimated H. midae have the ability to adapt to high temperatures, within their optimal range for growth, provided that they are exposed to sustained stable temperatures and do not experience short, high temperature spikes. These findings will aid in a better understanding of feed utilization and growth patterns of H. midae in the thermally variable intensive mariculture environment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Feed was fed to excess daily and uneaten food was collected. Temperature significantly affected the specific growth rate of both year classes of abalone. There was no significant effect of dietary protein level on specific growth rate; however, abalone compensated for a reduction of dietary protein by consuming more feed. This observation was evident with significant increases in feed conversion ratios as dietary protein levels decreased for both year classes. With the exception of abalone grown at 14 degrees C, when protein deposition decreased with increasing dietary protein level, protein deposition increased with an increase in dietary protein for both year classes. For 1-y-old abalone, as temperature increased from 14-22 degrees C, the optimum crude dietary protein levels increased from similar to 29% similar to 35%. For 2-y-old abalone, the optimum crude protein level appeared to be less, and increased from 24% at 14 degrees C to 34% at 22 degrees C.

This study conducted a comprehensive assessment to examine the physiological impact of a low salinity event on Pinctada maxima, which included measure- ments of haemolymph electrolytes, haemocytes functions, and non-targeted metabolomics analyses. A total of 92 metabolites were detected in the gill tissue of P. maxima. Six hours after exposure, low salinity stress impacted five metabolomic pathways, with succinic acid and alanine being highly upregulated. However, the electrolyte and the measured immune response were unaffected at that sampling time. After 24 h of exposure to low salinity conditions, a significant decrease in the concentrations of key electrolytes in the haemolymph was observed, including Na+, Cl-, K+, and Ca2+. Furthermore, the immune responses of the pearl oysters were affected by hypo-salinity stress. Additionally, the total haemocyte count decreased significantly, and some important immune functions, such as the phagocytosis capacity and the intracellular oxidative activity were suppressed. After 72 h of exposure to low salinity, an increase in alanine and succinic acid levels indicated the onset of anaerobic metabolism. The prolonged hyposalinity exposure (72 h) impacted nine metabolomic pathways. The downregulation of adenosine suggested the impairment of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway, which inhibits ambient inorganic ions entering the gill cells. This study identified potential metabolic biomarkers such as succinic acid in oysters exposed to hyposalinity stress.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.741242

This study examined the protein content, and dietary value to abalone post-larvae, of seven benthic diatoms acclimated to high-(H=49.4 mg NO3-N L-1) and standard-nitrate (S= 16.5 mg NO3-N l(-1)) Walne medium. In Experiment 1, the level of nitrate in the culture medium did not significantly affect the protein content of Cocconeis sp., Cylindrotheca closterium or Nitzschia ovalis, and variation in the growth of post-larval Haliotis iris was not associated with nitrate level or the protein content of the diatoms. When the same six diatom diets were added daily as cell suspensions, growth and survival were much lower than for the equivalent strains fed as established films (P < 0.0001). In Experiment 2a, the protein content of Navicula incerta was elevated by nitrate supplementation, and the high nitrate strain retained a higher protein content (P=0.005) even after 24 days growing in unenriched, flowing seawater. Haliotis rufescens post-larvae grew significantly faster when fed N. incerta H than when fed N. incerta S (P=0.006) and survival was also higher with this diet (67 versus 54%). In Experiment 2b, there was no significant effect of nitrate level on protein content of four diatoms or the performance of post-larval H. rufescens. There was, however, a strong positive correlation (r=0.95, P < 0.0001) between post-larval survival and the lipid content of the diatom diets. Post-larval growth showed positive, but marginally non-significant, relationships with diatom protein and carbohydrate, but no relationship with lipid content. Overall, only one of seven benthic diatom species acclimated to high-nitrate growth medium displayed significantly elevated protein content. Diatom protein content explained relatively little of the variation in food value of diatom strains for post-larval abalone but lipid content correlated strongly with post-larval survival.

It is not known whether grazing selectivity occurs by postlarvae and young abalones at this time. Thus, experiments were conducted to determine whether discrimination by juveniles of red abalone (Hellions rufescens) occurs while grazing on diatoms that grow on the rocks and kelp blades extracted from their habitat, and to determine whether the ingested diatoms are, indeed, digested. Our hypothesis was that juveniles of H. rufescens would feed nonselectively on the diatom films, thus, the characteristics of the diatom assemblages (species composition, diversity) from their gut contents should be similar to those upon which they feed. We also expected that the smaller forms of diatoms would pass through the digestive tract intact. Overall, 171 diatom taxa were identified: 123 in the tank walls, 35 on the rocks, 143 in the gut contents, and 38 in the feces. Only Amphora pediculus appeared in all the gut contents examined; however, 12 taxa accounted for 80% of the relative abundance (n = 500). Highest diversity ((H) over bar = 4.46) was measured in the walls of a tank where M. pyrifera was included, but abalone specimens from this tank showed the lowest H' value in their gut contents. The hypothesis that grazing by young H. rufescens is nonselective is supported, as well as the importance of the structure of the diatom assemblage grazed upon (as in H. fulgens), which is reflected in their gut contents. Moreover, feces analysis showed that many small diatoms that are ingested are not digested, and are able to reproduce and grow after passing through the digestive tract.",10.2983/035.029.0429

Hybridization is a classical breeding method that can effectively improve the genetic characteristics of organisms through heterosis. Abalone has become an increasingly economically important aquaculture resource with high commercial value. However, due to changing climate, abalone is now facing serious threats of high temperature in summer. Interspecific hybrid abalone (Haliotis gigantea female x H. discus hannai male, SD) has been cultured at large scale in southern China and has been shown high survival rates under heat stress in summer. Therefore, SD has become a good model material for heterosis research, but the molecular basis of heterosis remains elusive. Results Heterosis in thermal tolerance of SD was verified through Arrhenius break temperatures (ABT) of cardiac performance in this study. Then RNA-Sequencing was conducted to obtain gene expression patterns and alternative splicing events at control temperature (20 degrees C) and heat stress temperature (30 degrees C). A total of 356 (317 genes), 476 (435genes), and 876 (726 genes) significantly diverged alternative splicing events were identified in H. discus hannai (DD), H. gigantea (SS), and SD in response to heat stress, respectively. In the heat stress groups, 93.37% (20,512 of 21,969) of the expressed genes showed non-additive expression patterns, and over-dominance expression patterns of genes account for the highest proportion (40.15%). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the overlapping genes among common DEGs and NAGs were significantly enriched in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, mitophagy, and NF-kappa B signaling pathway. In addition, we found that among these overlap genes, 39 genes had undergone alternative splicing events in SD. These pathways and genes may play an important role in the thermal resistance of hybrid abalone. Conclusion More alternative splicing events and non-additive expressed genes were detected in hybrid under heat stress and this may contribute to its thermal heterosis. These results might provide clues as to how hybrid abalone has a better physiological regulation ability than its parents under heat stress, to increase our understanding of heterosis in abalone.",10.1186/s12864-021-07954-y

No significant difference in survival rate was observed among abalone fed with different diets. Weight gain rate (WGR) and daily growth rate of shell length (DGR (SL)) were significantly increased in abalone fed with diets containing OO, AO and EO, but decreased in abalone fed with LO diet (P < 0.05) in comparison with those fed with TP. High level of dietary 18:2n-6 resulted in higher content of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in abalone fed with GO than those fed with TP, OO, LO and EO (P < 0.05). n-3 PUFAs in abalone fed with LO was significantly higher than those in abalone fed with TP, OO, GO and AO (P < 0.05). The highest contents of 20:1n-9 and 22:1n-9 were observed in abalone fed with OO.

Here, we investigated the effects of different dose levels of Co-60 gamma radiation (GR) on tolerance to high temperature (HT) and low salinity (LS) stress and immunological responses in the commercially consumed abalone, Haliotis discus discus. Although H. discus discus exhibited a significantly lower survival rate (SR) at a high level of GR (25 Gy) than the control (0Gy), an increased SR and higher cardiovascular hemocyte counts were exhibited at 20 Gy. Furthermore, enhanced tolerance to HT (30 degrees C) and LS (25 psu) stress, and increased lysozyme activity, were exhibited by the GR-treated H. discus discus groups. Although similar respiratory burst activity after 24 h of stress exposure was exhibited by all of the groups, significantly enhanced superoxide dismutase activity was exhibited in the GR-treated abalone groups under LS stress. Our results indicate that GR-treated H. discus discus exhibit hormetic responses to (CO)-C-60 gamma radiation against environmental stressors because of increased innate immune responses. Statement of relevance It is considered that our study will provide beneficial information about potential use of gamma-radiation techniques for the environmentally-strong abalone production in aquaculture industry.

Results showed that the source of Zn affects shrimp growth, survival and immune parameters. Shrimp fed diets with organic zinc supplementation produced significantly higher growth, survival and immune parameters than ZnSO4 treatment. Shrimp supplemented with ZnMet had the highest weight gain and immune parameters. However, there were no significant differences in weight gain, survival, total hemocyte counts, phagocytotic activity, PO, AKP and SOD between the ZnLys and ZnGly groups.

It has been associated with conditions of high water temperature (>23 degrees C), low dissolved oxygen levels, and a range of other stressful factors in the culture water during summer months. This study aimed to alleviate mortality experienced by abalone at high water temperatures (26 degrees C), by dietary intervention using grape seed extract (GSE) and dried Ulva lactuca Linnaeus, two products which contain antioxidative and bioactive compounds. These products were formulated into a commercial abalone diet at levels of 5 and 30%. The diets were fed to 3-year-old greenlip abalone (26.8 g; 57.9 mm) at a water temperature of 22 or 26 degrees C for 38 days. No mortalities were observed at 22 degrees C. Compared to the unaltered commercial diet, both GSE and dried U. lactuca additive diets significantly increased the survival of abalone at the 26 degrees C water temperature (P<0.05). GSE addition also significantly increased serum superoxide dismutase activity, feed intake, and meal acceptance of the abalone (P<0.05). These results demonstrate the potential for GSE or dried U. lactuca to act as dietary additives to reduce mortality and improve productivity on abalone farms subjected to high summer water temperatures.

Diatom strain affected both survival and growth, which were positively correlated (r = 0.88, p = 0.05, n = 5). The digestibility and ingestibility of diatoms were both important. Survival ranged from low (<10% on day 37 postsettlement) on Pleurosigma sp. diet, to high (>70% on day 68) on Cocconeis scutellum, Cylindrotheca closterium, and Navicula ramosissima diets. Diet had little effect on growth and survival in the first 16 days after settlement, provided postlarvae were ingesting adequate food.

The digestion efficiency of two diatom strains increased markedly during the experiment, because of changes in diatom condition. Postlarvae were feeding on small diatoms (12 x 4 x 3 mu m) by day 2 postsettlement, and digestive gland development became visible on day 3.

We assessed organismal (rates of oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion) and cellular (heat shock protein expression, anti-oxidant enzymes) responses of juvenile and adult abalone exposed to low (similar to 83% of saturation), intermediate (similar to 95% of saturation) and high (similar to 115% of saturation) oxygen levels for one month. Using the Comet assay, we measured DNA damage to determine whether the observed trends in the protective responses were sufficient to prevent oxidative damage to cells. Juveniles were unaffected by moderately hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions. Elevated basal rates of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase were sufficient to prevent DNA fragmentation and protein damage. Adults, with their lower basal rate of anti-oxidant enzymes, had increased DNA damage under hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions, indicating that the antioxidant enzymes were unable to prevent oxidative damage under hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions.

The survival ranged from 74.7% to 92.7% although it was not significantly different among treatments. These data indicate that high levels of dietary lipid negatively affect abalone growth whereas high levels of carbohydrate support this growth. A high lipid diet resulted in low total feed intake probably because of its high caloric value, leading to poor growth.

The Port Nolloth study showed that juvenile abalone Haliotis midae hiding under sea urchins Parechinus angulosus were safe from predation by rock lobsters, which seemed to prefer the sea urchins as food. However, the Cape Town study showed that rock lobsters preferentially selected juvenile abalone over sea urchins. Because of the importance of these results to abalone ranching and the South African abalone fishery, the experiments were repeated at the two study sites, using a standardized experimental protocol. Rock lobsters from both sites showed a strong preference for juvenile abalone over sea urchins, even in the presence of kelp Ecklonia maxima. There was no significant difference (F-3.92 = 0.09, P > 0.1) in abalone consumption by rock lobsters between the two sites. Therefore, at least in the absence of preferred prey such as mussels, sea urchins appear to provide only limited protection to juvenile abalone from rock lobsters.",10.2989/18142320309504024

Production has continually increased, and approximately 442,637 tonnes wet weight was harvested in Korea in 2015. Abalone is a highly sought-after delicacy in Korea, and the abalone farming industry has been developed based on a stable production of seaweed. Korean abalone farmers prefer to feed their stock on locally cultured S. japonica; however, between August and November, the supply of farmed S. japonica declines because higher seawater temperatures reduce S. japonica productivity. In an attempt to overcome this temperature-induced period of low production, cultivation trials with a strain of S. japonica selected to withstand higher cultivation temperatures were undertaken. Strain selection involved using individual parent thalli that were found to remain productive under high seawater temperature (26 A degrees C) at Wando. Male and female gametophytes were isolated through 3 cycles of free-living gametophyte culture to produce the F-3 strain used in the production trials. Production trials using the selected strain were initiated every month between December 2014 and March 2015. This delayed the initiation of culture beyond the latest initiation time currently used by farmers (December). Delaying initiation of cultivation resulted in delayed maximum growth compared to the control. Growth of the F-3 strain continued for up to 3 months longer than normally achieved on farms for non-selected thalli. The mean length, growth rate, and biomass were also greater than those achieved by the control strain. The use of the F-3 strain of S. japonica coupled with delayed initiation of culture can therefore be used to help to ensure a stable year round algal feed supply for abalone industry in Korea.",10.1007/s10811-017-1179-2

It is associated with high water temperature (greater than 23 degrees C), low dissolved oxygen levels, increased bacterial loads, and immune system suppression during summer months. This study aimed to alleviate mortality rates of greenlip abalone by dietary intervention using vitamin K-1 to support the innate immune system and oxidative status. Dietary vitamin K-1 at 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 mg kg(-1) was added to a commercially formulated diet mash. An additional diet containing 0.5 mg kg(-1) of K-3 was also used for comparison. Diets were fed to 3-y-old abalone (71.51 g; 79.91 mm) at 22 and 25 degrees C water temperatures for 39 days. No mortalities were observed at 22 degrees C; however, high mortalities were observed in all dietary treatments at the water temperature of 25 degrees C. Compared with the negative control diet (0.0 mg additional inclusion of K-1 or K-3 kg(-1)) at 25 degrees C, the inclusion of vitamin K-1 or K-3 did not improve survival of greenlip abalone (P > 0.05). Vitamin K-1 inclusion level resulted in significant increases in vitamin K-1 concentration of visceral organ and muscle tissues (P < 0.05). Steady-state levels of vitamin K-1 were not reached. Steady-state levels of K-2-MK-4 in visceral organ and muscle were reached when analyzed levels of dietary vitamin K-1 reached 0.02 mg kg(-1). This was also true for K-2-MK-7, but in the visceral organ only. Vitamin K-1 inclusion level did not significantly affect total hemocyte count, phagocytic activity, or phagocytic index (P > 0.05). Increasing water temperature to 25 degrees C resulted in significant increases in serum catalase activity (22 < 25 degrees C) and vitamin K-1 concentration in muscle tissue (22 < 25 degrees C). Comparison of vitamin K-1 or K-3 at 0.5 mg kg(-1) resulted in significant changes to serum catalase activity (K-1 > K-3) and vitamin K-1 concentration in visceral organ (K-1 > K-3).

Five treatment diets had supple-mentation with alpha-starch (Sta), dextrin (Dex), pullulan gum (Pg), xanthan gum (Xg), and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). At the end of the feeding trial, the best growth performance (weight gain, 442.23%) and diet efficiency (protein efficiency ratio, 1.25, and feed conversion ratio [FCR], 2.04) were exhibited by the dog conch fed the Sta diet, whereas the lowest growth performance was observed in the dog conch fed the Xg and CMC diets. Dog conch fed the Sta (2.04) diet had a lower FCR than dog conch fed the other experimental diets (3.92e5.46). Apparent dietary digestibility (ADD) was significantly higher in dog conch fed the Sta diet than in the dog conch that were fed the other experimental diets. The ADD of protein was significantly lower in the dog conch fed the CMC diet than in those fed the other dietary treatments. The lowest ADD for energy was observed in the dog conch fed the CMC diet, followed by the Xg diet and Pg diet. Moisture, crude protein, and muscle crude lipid were affected by the carbohydrate source. An increase in carbohydrate complexity in the diet led to an enhancement of crude protein content and muscle crude lipid content. Compared with the other diets, the Sta diet yielded a significantly greater improvement in all shell parameters. These findings indicate that dog conch fed a Sta diet demonstrate the best growth parameters, feed efficiency, and ADD; therefore, diets sup-plemented with Sta are suitable for improving dog conch growth.",10.51400/2709-6998.2686

Based on a 2 x 2 factorial design, four casein-gelatin-based diets were formulated. The basal diet was supplemented with either 0 or 2000 IU VD3/kg diet and 0 or 10 g P/kg diet. The abalone was reared in P-free artificial seawater for 55 days. Results showed that dietary VD3 was hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 [25(OH)D-3] and 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 [1alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3] in abalone, and subsequently raised the serum levels of these two VD3 metabolites. Dietary P deficiency elevated serum 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 level only when the dietary VD3 supplementation was sufficient. The supplementations of either dietary VD3 or P significantly increased the levels of P in serum, mantle and hepatopancreas, and only the addition of VD3 significantly raised the concentrations of Ca in serum and mantle (P < 0. 05). Interaction between dietary VD3 and P was only found significant on the concentrations of P and Mg in mantle (P < 0.05). The concentrations of Ca, P and Mg in muscle were not significantly influenced by these dietary treatments.

Haliotis diversicolor. In the present study, it was further observed that long-term chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of BaP modulated the immunocompetence of abalones in terms of the change in activity of the antioxidant and immune associated parameters tested. In addition, the effect of tributyltin (TBT), another important genotoxicant in the aquatic environment, was investigated. Exposure of abalones to sublethal concentrations of TBT and BaP for 21 days resulted in significant decrease of total hemocyte count, phagocytosis, membrane stability and lysozyme activity. Conversely induction of extra and intra cellular superoxide generation, nitric oxide, nitric oxide synthase and myeloperoxidase activity was present when the abalones were exposed to TBT and BaP. Most of the immune associated parameters tested showed clear time dependent response to both toxicants. Within 14 days after the 21 day exposure to BaP, recovery was observed as evidenced by most of the parameters returning to their normal level. However, no recovery was observed within 14 days after the 21 day exposure to TBT as evidenced by continued elevation of intra cellular superoxide and nitrite production and decrease in THC, membrane stability and lysozyme activity. This suggested a prolonged TBT-induced impact on the immune reaction and possibly more damage than that caused by BaP. Overall the results suggest that chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of TBT or BaP causes modulations in the immunocompetence of abalones with most of the immune associated parameters tested being stimulated, and this might be harmful to the host.

Juvenile abalone were fed four encapsulated experimental diets with varying levels of insect meal/grape marc and a commercial feed for 165 days in a commercial farm. The gut health of abalone was evaluated through histopathology, and 16S rRNA amplicon libraries through Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The abalone metabolome was evaluated through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results showed that animals had good intestinal condition across all dietary treatments. Microbiome analysis revealed increased relative abundances of bacteria (Firmicutes and Fusobacterium) associated with the breakdown of polysaccharides in diets including insect meal and grape marc. Metabolite profile variations indicate that the inclusion of insect meal and grape marc favoured fatty acid metabolism and amino acid catabolism, respectively.

Cultures were carried out in lantern and basket nets suspended in seawater tanks having a constant flow of fresh seawater from La Herradura Bay. A total of 900 juveniles were observed, starting with individuals having an average length of 20 mm. The abalone juveniles were fed with two species of macroalgae, half of which was Gracilaria chilensis, and the other was half Ulva sp (mass basis), fed ad libitum. Artificial pelletized food was fed as a supplement, at a rate of 2% of the body mass of the abalones daily. Water quality in the cultures was monitored twice daily, included water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and water flow rate. The average survival of the abalones at the termination of the experimental period was 96.2% in the lantern nets, and 94.6% in the culture baskets, although these differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05; nested ANOVA). The highest mean specific growth rates were obtained in the lantern net systems with rates of 0.34% per day in length and 1.02% per day in weight; comparative values for the basket systems were 0.31% per day and 0.86% per day. Higher growth rates for weight and length of the shell were obtained in the lantern systems than in the basket culture systems. An analysis of covariance of values for growth in weight and length of the abalones showed significant differences between results from the lantern and basket systems (P < 0.05). Based on the results of the Study, the lantern systems should be considered as an interesting alternative for the culture of Haliotis discus hannai both in land-based cultures, and at sea, because they have a larger carrying capacity for abalones compared with the baskets in the culture tanks and only occupy one third of the water column space.

During this period, abalone pass through profound morphological and physiological changes, which suitable nutrient requirements must sustain. An inadequate diet can result in adverse effects such as late metamorphosis, starvation, slow growth and even death during this phase. Two strategies have been proposed to increase the growth and survival rates of weaning abalone: (i) extending feeding with benthic diatoms and (ii) abalone hybridization via interspecific crosses. To evaluate the efficiency of the two strategies, we assessed the growth and survival rates of postlarvae of pure red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and a hybrid obtained by crossing red abalone females with green abalone (H. fulgens) males. Both crosses were supplied with six different diets consisting of either one macroalgae mono-diet (Macrocystis pyrifera or Ulva ohnoi) or a mixture with Navicula incerta. Overall, cross-specific diets achieved better growth rates, suggesting that each cross may need specific food items (nutrients) during weaning. Moreover, pure red abalone generally showed the highest growth rates, while the hybrid abalone showed the highest survival rates with most tested diets. Hence, hybrids appear to be better at withstanding stressful conditions, and their use in aquaculture could reduce losses and increase commercial production.",10.3989/scimar.05300.055

A formulated diet (diet 1) served as the control. The diets were fed to abalone at 2-5% body weight once daily at 1600 h. Weight gain (WG), increase in shell length (SL), specific growth rate (SGR), protein efficiency ratio (PER) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were evaluated. Highest weight gain (WG: 454%) was attained with abalone fed diet 2 with protein sources coming from a combination of FM, SM, and DSM. This value was, however, not significantly different (P < 0.05) from those fed diets 4 and I (Control diet) with protein sources coming from FM, SM, SP and FM, DSM, SM, respectively. Abalone fed diet 3, which used both plant protein sources, DSM and SP, showed significantly lower WG (327%). Survival was generally high ranging from 85% to 100% for all treatments. The SGR showed the same trend as the percent weight gain. The FCR and PER obtained, however, were not significantly different for all treatments. The amino acid profile of diets 1, 2, and 4 simulated that of the abalone protein, which could have been a contributing factor to the higher growth rate of abalone fed these diets. Diet 3, which contained only plant protein sources, showed relatively lower methionine values compared with the abalone muscle tissue.

In Trial 1, RBM was used to replace 25%, 50%, and 100% of the dietary KM (RBM25, RBM50, and RBM100, respectively) based on a diet containing 30% KM (Con). In Trial 2, RBM50 was the same as in Trial 1, and betaine was supplemented in RBM50 at 0.2% (B1), 0.4% (B2), and 0.8% (B3) in the diets. Abalone (weight approximately 4 g) were randomly assigned to four groups replicated in triplicate (60 abalone/replicate). The abalone were fed the experimental diets for 10 weeks. In Trial 1, compared to the Con group, no significant differences were observed in final weight (FW), final shell length (FSL), specific growth rate (SGR), or daily increment in shell length (DISL) at 25% KM replacement by RBM. However, 50% KM replacement significantly reduced the FW, FSL, SGR, and DISL compared to the Con group. There were no significant differences in the proximate composition of the soft body tissues of the abalone. In Trial 2, growth performance parameters of the hybrid abalone were significantly improved with increasing levels of betaine in the diets compared to those fed diet RBM50, reaching the maximum value in the B2 group. Consistent with the feed intake results, the hormone concentrations of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and orexins in the digestive gland and cerebral ganglia of abalone were significantly increased when the supplementation level of betaine in the diets was increased to 0.2%. However, no apparent impacts were observed on NPY or orexin concentrations among the B1, B2, and B3 groups. Finally, we suggest 0.4% betaine supplementation along with replacing 50% of the KM with RBM in the hybrid abalone diet.

In Treatment 13, the abalone were maintained in complete darkness, and Treatment C included four h of light and 20 h of darkness. The results showed that juveniles cultured in total darkness demonstrated some retardation in growth early in the experiment compared with abalone in a natural light regimen, and those with a partial light regimen. After 43 days, the abalone in the partial light regimen reached and surpassed sizes of the abalone maintained in the natural light regimen and in total darkness, although their feeding activity and growth patterns were erratic compared with abalone in the normal light and total darkness regimes. The results of the experiment were inconclusive as to which light regimen was most favorable when considering the growth patterns and comparative mortality rates within the systems.",10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[763:EOTPRO]2.0.CO;2

Diet was shown not to have a significant effect on the time in which the worms on live hosts reached their maximum size. Diet did, however, influence the maximum size and consequently the growth rate of worms, which were larger and grew faster on kelp-fed abalone than on those fed a commercial pellet diet. Despite diet having no effect on fecundity and offspring size, kelp-fed worms matured earlier. The maximum size of kelp-fed worms was unaffected by the absence of a live host, suggesting that the worms do not rely on the host for food. The absence of a live host reduced the growth and sexual maturation rates of worms. There was no difference in the size of offspring in the two treatments, but fewer worms matured sexually and fewer broods were produced on shells only than on live hosts. The lower growth rate and reproductive output of worms on shells only may be due to the diversion of energy from growth and reproduction to burrow expansion.",10.1080/07924259.2002.9652761

Nutritional and physical parameters of these diets were used in a multivariate regression analysis to identify variables that explained the most variation in growth between diets. Parameters that were selected by this analysis were the ratio of crude protein (CP) to gross energy (GE) and the rate that protein leached from the formulated diets. The resulting regression equation was highly significant in its explanation of the variation in growth (P = 2.2 x 10(-6)). To determine the quality of the dietary CP in each diet, the essential amino acid profile of each diet was compared to that of whole soft body tissue in H. asinina. Methionine seemed to be deficient in all of the diets. Animals fed G. edulis did not seem to suffer from a lack of n-3 PUFAs.",

Between 80 and 102 days PS, L5 teeth appeared on the radula and there were fewer lateral serrations, consistent with the adult form of the animal, suggesting that this development is in preparation for feeding on macroalgae. Digestive gland complexity (tubule number and density) increased between 80 and 102 days PS and is consistent with greater enzyme production and increased digestive efficiency. Of the enzymes studied, laminarinase and lipase exhibited the highest activities in animals fed a diatom diet, both significantly increasing with age of the abalone. High laminarinase activities reflect higher utilisation of the algal polysaccharide chrysolaminarin in the diatom diet. Ingestion of artificial diet had no adverse effects on the morphological development of the digestive system, but trypsin activity in abalone fed the artificial diet was significantly higher than diatom-fed abalone of similar age, indicative of higher levels of protein in the artificial diet. Similarly, lipase activity was significantly lower in abalone fed the artificial diet and may reflect an inability to digest the fish oil component, which is not found in their natural diet. Future development of artificial diets, especially for juvenile abalone, should focus on the levels and type of lipid provided. Runt abalone (i.e. under-developed compared to their siblings) had radulae similar to much younger 80 days PS abalone and digestive tissue degradation at 137 days PS is evidence that runts have limited ability to ingest food and are nutritionally compromised.

Fish meal is a key ingredient used in aquaculture feeds due to its nutritional profile and palatability. Alternative ingredients, such as insect meal and grape marc, are potential candidates to be included in aquafeeds due to their suitable nutritional profile and more sustainable production. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of insect meal and grape marc on growth and nutritional profile using abalone as an animal model in a feeding trial for 165 days. Proximate analyses were used to identify nutritional variations in abalone tissue and faecal matter, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography mass-spectrometry analyses were utilised to characterise amino acid and fatty acid composition. Results showed a 95% survival for all treatments. The inclusion of insect meal and grape marc did not affect the protein proportions of abalone tissues, but differences were found in the carbohydrate and lipid proportions. The inclusion of insect meal and grape marc significantly affected levels of amino acids L-histidine, L-methionine, and L-phenylalanine, and fatty acids oleic acid, linoleaidic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, and & alpha;-linolenic suggesting a correlation between the feed source and fatty acid tissue composition.

Three experimental diets were formulated with 0 (Control), 700 (LA-700) and 2100 (LA-2100) mg/kg supplement of LA respectively. Each diet was randomly assigned to three replicates of 50 abalones (initial body weight: 3.17 +/- 0.01 g), which were exposed to 0.35 mg/L of waterborne Cd. Results showed that abalones' Cd bioaccumulation in the serum, mantle, gill, muscle and hepatopancreas were significantly reduced in LA supplement groups. Besides, in hepatopancreas, the activities of antioxidative enzymes and concentration of glutathione (GSH) in LA supplement group were significantly higher than those in control. Meanwhile, in hepatopancreas, LA-2100 group showed a significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and the protein carbonyls in LA supplement groups were significantly lower than those in control. Diets with LA supplementation significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of HdhMTF-1 (H. discus hannai metal-responsive transcription factor-1) and HdhMT (H. discus hannai metallothionein), and elevated metallothionein (MT) concentrations in hepatopancreas.

A volatile breakdown product of DMSP, dimethylsulfide (DMS), was formed in abalone during canning, causing repellent tastes and odours in some batches of canned meat. Abalone adductor muscle displayed high DMSP concentrations compared to other tissues. Further, the feeding regime determined the level to which DMSP accumulated: abalone previously fed Ulva accumulated DMSP to 16162 +/- 3408 mu g g(-1). This was higher than in wild-collected abalone (471 +/- 339 mu g g(-1)) or those fed with manufactured feeds (up to 46.2 +/- 9.6 mu g g(-1)) or Ecklonia (198 +/- 73 mu g g(-1)). A deputation phase prior to processing allowed for the reduction of tissue DMSP levels to those seen in wild abalone.

"Hayes, B; Baranski, M; Goddard, ME; Robinson, N",Optimisation of marker assisted selection for abalone breeding programs,2007,AQUACULTURE,265,1-Apr,61,69,,"A computer simulation model was used to optimise strategies for marker assisted selection with best linear unbiased prediction (MBLUP) for quantitative traits in a selective breeding program for the southern Australian abalone industry. The simulation model assumed five marker loci associated with genes affecting growth rate explained 50% of the genetic variance for this trait. Use of markers associated with improved disease resistance was also modelled. Parameters and simulation scheme used are described. The simulations accounted for the possibility of early induction of reproductive condition to reduce generation intervals and for selective genotyping. Affects on profitability were calculated using estimates from the industry of income and expenses for a typical farm and accounting for the costs associated with marker testing. While the extra genetic gains from MAS were in the order of 15%, if the cost of genotyping each marker per animal was $10 AUS, then M BLUP for growth was only profitable when 75 progeny per family were genotyped. Early selection (halving the generation interval) was advantageous for MBLUP and BLUP provided the number of progeny per family was greater 5, as the advantage of two generations of selection more than compensated for the decreased accuracy of selection for early growth. However accurate estimates of parameters, such as the genetic correlation between early growth rate and growth and age at first spawning, would need to be obtained before considering implementing this strategy. The advantage of MBLUP was greater for disease resistance than for growth rate. Selective genotyping, which would greatly reduced genotyping costs of implementing MBLUP to improve disease resistance, did not greatly reduce the additional response achieved with marker assisted selection.

Less attention has been given to the resulting quality of the seafood product from formulated feeds and the effect of the reduction of marine ingredients in these feeds. Marine n-3 fatty acids are particularly important nutritional factors of seafood that are lacking from feed ingredients at the base of the aquaculture production chain. Considering that this important category of nutrients is already deficient in the western diet, further erosion through cultivated seafood products is of concern. This study tested the effect of three diet categories on the fatty acid profiles of commercially farmed abalone. Two commercial formulated feeds, Ulva spp. macroalgae, and combinations of the formulated feeds and macroalgae were fed to six replicate baskets of 20 abalone (similar to 62 mm) for 12 months in Victoria, Australia. The macroalgae diets represented overall lower fatty acid content, including eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA), but higher relative amounts of alpha linolenic acid (ALA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), than the formulated feeds. The total lipid content of abalone tissue did not vary substantially across diet categories; however, the ratio of n-6:n-3 fatty acids decreased incrementally with the increasing macroalgae content in the diet and by a factor of two with a 100 % macroalgae diet. Also, equal or higher content of all important long chain n-3 fatty acids was achieved with a macroalgae diet despite the lower dietary content of some of these fatty acids. Marine fatty acid-deplete aquaculture feeds can result in decreased n-3 fatty acid content in the abalone tissue. The inclusion of macroalgae in the diet of abalone can offset this reduction.",10.1007/s10811-015-0530-8

Six isoenergetic and isolipidic diets containing graded levels of protein (15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, and 40%) were fed to the hybrid abalone for 90 days. Based on the specific growth rate, the optimum dietary protein levels for adult hybrid abalone using a quadratic curve model were estimated to be 28.07% and 26.47% of the diet at 23 degrees C (optimum temperature) and 27 degrees C (high temperature), respectively. The amount of crude protein in the abalone body increased linearly with the dietary protein levels and water temperature. Antioxidation enzyme activities of abalone muscle, including GPx and GST were significantly affected by the interaction of dietary protein levels and water temperature. As for texture analysis, the abalone kept at 23 degrees C exhibited higher meat hardness than those fed the same diets at 27 degrees C. The n-3 PUFAs (particularly DHA and EPA) in abalone meat were significantly influenced by dietary protein levels, and the highest content was observed in the 30% dietary protein group. These levels were not affected by water temperature. In addition, higher dietary protein levels and water temperatures increased the total contents of free amino acids and flavor amino acids (Asp + Glu + Gly + Ala + Arg + Tau). The cooking loss of abalone meat was reduced with increased protein levels and was significantly lower in the 23 degrees C group, along with a higher meat postmortem pH value. The collagen fiber ratio and collagen content of abalone meat were higher in the 23 degrees C group.

Larvae in another group were maintained until individuals metamorphosed spontaneously. Metamorphosed individuals (postlarvae) were reared in the laboratory at 20 C fed on a benthic diatom Cylindrotheca closterium or without any food in equivalent conditions. Metamorphosis, survival, and growth (determined from shell length) rates were measured. The percentage of individuals that had metamorphosed 2 days after the addition of GABA increased with the length of larval swimming period; larvae that were 5 and 19 days old when induced to metamorphose showed 19% (+/- 5.6; S.E.) and 96% (+/- 3.6) metamorphosis, respectively. The percentage of postlarvae that metamorphosed spontaneously increased after 17 days from fertilization and reached 96% (+/- 3.0) at 24 days postfertilization.

Taiwan abalone Haliotis diversicolor supertexta held in 30parts per thousand seawater were injected with V. parahaemolyticus grown in TSB containing NaCl at 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5% at a dose of 1.6 x 10(5) colony-forming units (cfu) abalone(-1). After 48 h, the cumulative mortality was significantly higher for the abalone challenged with V parahaemolyticus grown in 2.5% than those grown in 0.5 and 1.5% NaCl. In other experiments, abalones held in 30parts per thousand seawater were injected with TSB-grown V. parahaemolyticus (1.6 x 10(5) cfu abalone(-1)), and then transferred to 20, 25, 30 and 35parts per thousand seawater. All abalones held in 20parts per thousand were killed in 48 h. The mortality of V. parahaemolyticus-injected abalone held in 30parts per thousand was significantly lower over 24-120 h. Abalone held in 30parts per thousand seawater and then transferred to 20, 25, 30 and 35parts per thousand were examined for THC (total haemocyte count), phenoloxidase activity, respiratory burst, phagocytic activity and clearance efficiency of V parahemolyticus after 24 and 72 h. The THC increased directly related with salinity levels. Phenoloxidase activity, respiratory burst, phagocytic activity and clearance efficiency of V parahaemolyticus decreased significantly for the abalone in 20, 25 and 35parts per thousand. It is concluded that the abalone transferred from 30parts per thousand to 20, 25 and 35parts per thousand had reduced immune ability and decreased resistance against V. parahaemolyticus infection.

Larvae were settled on Ulvella lens and Ulva rigida germlings at a density of 0.5 larvae cm(2) of substrate. Growth and survival, in each dietary treatment, were monitored during ten weeks. Experimental nursery tanks were weekly inoculated with 2 L of the different diatom inoculums (10(5)-10(6) cells mL(-1)). Proximate biochemical compositions were significantly different for the four diatom species. Amphora sp. presented a significantly higher lipid and protein contents with 7.11 +/- 0.29% DW and 18.50 +/- 0.97% DW respectively, while Proschkinia sp. presented the lowest protein content and the highest ash content The fatty acid profiles of the diatoms were variable but remained typical of the diatom family. Larvae contained significantly more lipids (25.30 +/- 0.93% DW) than juveniles. The different fatty acid compositions found for the various diatom species were dissimilar to the ones of larvae, juveniles and substrates; (Courtois de Vicose et al., in press-a) the fatty acid compositions of these last two not being different among treatments. 16:4n - 3, 20:4n - 6 (arachidonic acid, ARA) and 22:5n - 3 (docosapentaenoic acid, DPA) were the most abundant fatty acids in juveniles while 20:5n - 3 (ecosapentaenoic acid, EPA) was the dominant polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), present at a comparable level in all diatoms. This suggests that the post-larvae and juveniles are capable to absorb a selection of fatty acids from the food source or that they are able to synthesise them from precursor dietary fatty acids. Growth rates obtained in the present study are presenting different phases and diatom diets made little difference to growth rate of post-larvae until reaching around 0.8-1 mm SL, after which divergence in growth rate among diets became significant. Post-larvae fed the diatom with the highest protein and lipid contents (Amphora sp.) showed the best daily growth rate (DGR) of 50 +/- 3 mu m over the feeding trial, highlighting the joint influence of diatoms' protein and lipid content on growth. Around 2 mm SL, juveniles exhibited increased growth rates, in all treatments, reaching 94 mu m day(-1), indicating a possible shift in nutrition towards green macroalgae germlings and suggesting that U. lens and U. rigida are used as a complement to the diatom diet at this stage. 18:2n - 6 and 18:3n - 3 found in high amount in all juveniles as well as in all substrates could be an indication of that nutritional shift and could be involved in growth enhancement.

To determine if a candidate aquaculture species, Haliotis kamtschatkana, exhibits density-dependent growth we raised animals at three density levels and two food treatments: unlimited (ad libitum) and rationed (individual portions were the same among density treatments). We also tested for differences in food consumption, foraging patterns and stacking behaviour among the density levels. We observed density-dependent growth in the rationed treatments, indicating that relatively high growth rates at lower densities are driven, in part, by factors other than differences in food consumption. However, overall the quantity of food consumed related directly to growth; treatments fed ad libitum had higher growth rates. Furthermore, even when food was provided in excess, foraging was restricted to similar to 2 h after sunset in all treatments and the amount consumed per abalone was significantly lower at high densities. This is probably because high density animals could not access the food provided: fewer were observed foraging and they had to move from prominent stacks. Our results indicate that both temporal and spatial access to food are critical and that managers can observe foraging and stacking by abalone in tanks to determine if a specific design will limit food consumption, and ultimately growth.

Most individual abalone showed active feeding behavior, but there was considerable variation in growth of abalone between different algae and developmental stages of abalone. The growth rates of smaller post-larvae (0.4-1.2 mm SL) fed gametophytes and juvenile sporophytes of L. japonica, or A. longipes were significantly lower than those fed C. closterium. In contrast, juvenile sporophytes of L. japonica and A. longipes produced significantly faster growth in larger postlarval abalone (>1.8 mm SL) than gametophytes of L. japonica or C. closterium. Postlarvae in all developmental stages fed C. closterium actively grazed and efficiently ingested diatom cells. However, the relative dietary value of C. closterium decreased as abalone grew, probably because feeding efficiency on this diatom decreased because of its low cell volume and thin film-like colonies. Smaller post-larvae (0.4-1.2 min SL) grazed repeatedly on the same surface of gametophytes, juvenile sporophytes of L japonica, or on A. longipes without detaching these algae, whereas larger post-larvae (>1.8 mm SL) detached and ingested large amounts of whole cells of these algae. Postlarval abalone (>1.8 mm SL) began to use L. japonica gametophytes and juvenile sporophytes at approximately the same size at which morphologic changes occurred in their radulae, which enabled the ingestion of macroalgae.",

Eight isonitrogenous diets with two levels of lipid (4.3% and 6.3%) and four levels of bile acids (0, 15, 60 and 240 mg/kg) were formulated in a 2 x 4 two-factor design. The results showed that 6.3% of dietary lipid decreased the weight gain rate (WGR) of abalone, which increased as the dietary bile acids level increasing from 0 mg/kg to 60 mg/kg. The treatment with the highest WGR contained 4.3% of dietary lipid and 60 mg/kg of dietary bile acids. In the groups with 4.3% of dietary lipid, the expression of genes involved in lipid transport and lipolysis was increased (P < 0.05). And dietary bile acids increased the expression of genes involved in lipid transport and lipolysis while decreased the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis (P < 0.05). The expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, such as cluster of differentiation, fatty acid transport protein, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, revealed the interactions between dietary lipid and bile acids (P < 0.05).

Radula morphology was examined by SEM, and compared with that of competent larvae (260-280 mu m shell length (SL)) and adults (125-130 mm SL). Larvae (130 degrees C.days old) had a well-formed radula with similar to 10 rows of teeth. Each row comprised 1 rachidian tooth, 2 pairs of lateral teeth, and 1 pair of marginal teeth. The number of rows of teeth increased to 26-29 by similar to 500 mu m SL (Day 10 post-settlement) and stayed at that level throughout the post-larval period (maximum size/age observed was 2.7 mm SL at Day 60). Marginal teeth were added steadily to give similar to 30 pairs per row at similar to 2.5 mm SL (compared to 60-80 in adults). Lateral teeth (L3-L5) were added between 1.0 and 1.7 mm SL to complete the adult complement. Progressive changes in the post-larval radula above 1-1.5 mm SL included: (1) reduction of serrations on the margins of rachidian and lateral teeth, particularly the more central (R, L1, L2) teeth; (2) increased spacing between adjacent rows of teeth; (3) lengthening of the outer lateral teeth (L3-L5) making them larger and taller than the central (R, L1, L2) teeth. The clearance angle of rachidian and lateral teeth was variable, but generally increased as post-larvae grew. Post-larvae <1 mm SL had highly curved teeth and apparent clearance angles around or below 0 degrees. Larger post-larvae had positive clearance angles. These developments suggest that the teeth of post-larvae <1 mm SL probably function as scoops which slide across the surface collecting small diatoms and other fine, loose particles. Radulae of post-larvae > 1mm SL become more suitable for collecting larger particles, and gouging feeding substrata.",

Four treatments were used, namely, abalone cocultured with sea cucumber cleaned once (AS1) and twice weekly (AS2); abalone monoculture cleaned once (A1) and cleaned twice weekly (A2). Abalone (initial avg weight = 40.9 g) were maintained under commercial stocking conditions in flow through systems at a salinity of 35 ppt and fed a commercial formulated diet (Abfeed (TM)) and fresh seaweed (Ulva lacinulata and Gracillaria gracilis). The stocking densities were 200 abalone m(-2) and 50 sea cucumbers m(-2).

The survival rate of the sea cucumbers was high, however, the sea cucumbers experienced a reduction in weight regardless of the treatment. This study showed that growth optimisation in abalone farming can be achieved by cleaning tanks twice instead of once weekly. However, when abalone are cocultured with sea cucumber, tanks need only be cleaned once a week without compromising abalone growth or water quality. The coculture of abalone and sea cucumber results in an additional aquacultured product, a significant reduction in labour and other associated costs of cleaning, without an additional cost of production.",10.1007/s10499-024-01508-1

Abalone MT shares conserved structural features with previously known gastropod orthologs at both genomic (i.e., tripartite organization) and amino acid (conserved Cys motifs) levels. The 5'-flanking regulatory region of abalone MT gene displayed various transcription factor binding motifs particularly including ones related with metal regulation and stress immune responses. Tissue distribution and basal expression patterns of MT mRNAs indicated a (p)otential association between ovarian MT expression and sexual maturation. Developmental expression pattern suggested the maternal contribution of MT mRNAs to embryonic and early larval developments. Abalone MT mRNAs could be significantly induced by various heavy metals in different tissues (gill, hepatopancreas, muscle and hemocyte) in a tissue- and/or metal-dependent fashion. In addition, the abalone MT gene was highly modulated in responsive to other non-metal, stimulatory treatments such as immune challenge (LPS, polyI:C and bacterial injections), hypoxia (decrease from normoxia 8 ppm-2 ppm), thermal elevation (increase from 20 C to 30 C), and xenobiotic exposure (250 ppb of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol and 0.25 ppb of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin) where differential expression patterns were toward either up- or down-regulation depending on types of stimulations and tissues examined.

To study this process at the earliest stage, the progeny of 3 different broodstocks obtained from wild parents, selected farmed abalone and randomly sampled farmed abalone, were studied. After rearing for 16 mo in separate tanks, offspring from the 3 progenies were placed together in sea cages at the same density. After 3 yr, behavioural traits were studied, and the immune status after a stress situation was assessed. Mortality and growth were also recorded. In spite of the fact that no significant differences were observed in survival, growth or immune status traits between the 3 progenies, less progeny from the selected broodstock performed the complete sequence of anti-predation behaviour, and they took more time to reach their hides compared to the wild progeny. In addition, the shell colours of the selected progeny were more orange and had more stripes compared to the brown-green colour of the wild progeny. Progeny of randomly sampled broodstock showed intermediate responses between those of wild and selected progeny. Our results suggest that associated behavioural trade-offs can take place after only one generation of selection to improve growth. This should be taken into consideration when using selected stocks for ranching or population enhancement programs.",10.3354/aei00300

The meat quality of the cultivated abalone fed with kelp (K-abalone), salted Wakame seaweed (S-abalone), or artificial diet (A-abalone) was evaluated with respect to moisture, breaking strength, free amino acids (FAA), ATP and its related compounds (ARC), and sensory evaluation. Moisture was low in A-abalone. Total amount of FAA was almost the same in each abalone, whereas glycine content was high in K-abalone. Moreover, four FAA, valine, leucine, phenylalanine and histidine, were significantly low in K-abalone. ARC composition was not affected by the diet. Sensory tests showed that S-abalone was soft, which was in accordance with the result of breaking strength. K-abalone was rich in sweetness, and it was suggested that the sweetness was affected by FAA composition. A-abalone was moderate in all attributes.

Eight experimental diets with graded levels of carbohydrates (18.08%, 22.10%, 26.10%, 29.90%, 34.00%, 38.01%, 41.98% and 45.55%, named as T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7 and T8, respectively) were designed to feed abalone (initial weight 22.52 +/- 0.05 g) for 110 days. The results showed that the diet containing 38.01% carbohydrate significantly increased the survival rate (SR) and weight gain rate (WGR) of abalone (P < 0.05). Based on the quadratic regression mode of WGR, the optimal dietary carbohydrate level for abalone was estimated to be 37.05%. The activities of intestinal digestive enzymes were significantly increased in the T6 group. Moreover, the expressions of pyruvate kinase (pk) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pdh) in digestive glands were up-regulated with the increase of carbohydrate content in diets, while the expression of hexokinase (hk) reached the maximum in the T6 group. The highest expressions of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pepck), glucose-6-phosphatase (g6pase) and insulin signaling pathway related genes were found in the T6 group. The expressions of key genes related to lipolysis reached the highest in the T6 group, and then down-regulated with the further increasing dietary carbohydrate levels. The expression of key genes of lipogenesis was up-regulated with the increasing dietary carbohydrate levels. In conclusion, 38.01% of dietary carbohydrate level improved the growth performance of abalone. Dietary carbohydrate levels influenced the glucose and lipid metabolism including insulin signaling pathway. Abalone potentially had the capability to deal with a high-carbohydrate load (45.55%) by increasing glycolysis and decreasing gluconeogenesis. Meanwhile, it promoted lipid synthesis and inhibited lipolysis under high dietary carbohydrate load.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738284

The protein sources selected for the trial comprised four fishmeals, casein, spirulina, abalone viscera silage, brewery waste, torula yeast, carcass, sunflower and cotton seed meals. The results indicated that in terms of growth and feed efficiency the fishmeals and spirulina were the most suitable candidates for use as primary protein sources in formulated feeds, and with the exceptions of the carcass meal and brewery waste, the remaining protein sources demonstrated promise as partial primary protein source replacements. Mean growth rates for the large and small abalone over the experimental period were 1.45 and 1.24 mm month(-1) respectively.

This study focused on the potential detoxification ability of disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) GST theta (AbGST-theta) under different stress conditions with special reference to post immune challenges. Characterization of AbGST-theta revealed with 226 amino acids, 26.6 kDa of predicted molecular mass and 8.9 of theoretical isoelectric point. As illustrated in the multiple sequence alignment, eight glutathione binding sites (G-sites) and ten substrate binding sites (H-sites) were identified in well-distinct N-terminal and C-terminal domains of AbGST-theta, respectively. AbGST-theta exhibited its highest sequence identity with Mizuhopecten yessoensis (59.1%) and the phylogenetic tree clearly positioned AbGST-theta with pre-defined GST-theta molluscan homologues. The AbGST-8 was highly expressed in the digestive tract of un-challenged abalones. Upon administering the challenge experiment, AbGST-theta showed significant modulations in their transcriptional levels depending on the time and the tissue type. The optimum temperature was 37 degrees C and optimum pH was 7.5 for AbGST-theta. The determined enzyme kinetic parameters of AbGST-theta showed low affinity towards 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and glutathione (GSH) as substrates. Nonetheless, with Cibacron blue IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) was calculated to be 0.08 mu M while observing 100% inhibition with 100 mu M.

L. undosum did not discriminate among three kelp foods (Egregia menziesii, Eisenia arborea and Macrocystis pyrifera) but ate kelp preferentially and more rapidly over all but Ulva spp. among tested macrophytes. Secondary preferences were established for the red alga Pterocladiella capillacea, followed by the coralline Lithothrix aspergillum, whereas the brown seaweeds Zonaria farlowii and Halidrys dioica and the seagrass Phyllospadix torreyi were the least preferred macrophytes. Fastest consumption rates (1.91 g day(-1)) were measured in trials consisting only of kelp foods. These results indicate that L. undosum exhibits clear feeding preferences even when given less-preferred, non-kelp macrophytes. Using an ash-marker technique, we determined total organic, carbon, and nitrogen assimilation efficiencies (AE%) for six macroalgae used in preference trials. Tested macrophytes were assimilated at different efficiencies but a pattern was not detected between AE (%) and a macrophyte's position in L. undosum's preference hierarchy. Highest total organic AEs were found for P. capillacea (61.2%) and H. dioica (59.4%); lowest AEs were detected for E. menziesii (34.9%), a preferred dietary item. Nitrogen was assimilated from red algae with higher efficiencies (74.9-84.3%) than from brown or green algae. These data suggest that the digestive capabilities of L. undosum are better suited for assimilating organic material and nitrogen from less-preferred, non-kelp foods. This supports the hypothesis that factors besides nutritional composition and digestive optimization have played a role in the evolution of feeding preferences in L. undosum and probably other herbivorous snails associated with northeastern Pacific kelp beds.",10.1007/s00227-005-0166-3

Five diets were formulated to have the same total digestible protein and energy contents, based on the apparent amino acid and energy digestibility coefficients of their ingredients. Despite similar nutrient profiles, the diets differed in their level of inclusion and combinations of four ingredients: semolina, soyflour, casein, and fishmeal. Diets were offered at two levels, subsatiation (0.01 g/d/abalone) and excess (0.1 g/d/abalone). Specific growth rates of shell length and wet weight of abalone were not significantly different among diets between feed levels. Thus, it seems that amino acid and energy digestibility coefficients of individual ingredients can be used effectively to formulate diets for abalone to desired levels of digestible protein and energy.

Pyrene can cause the immune disturbance and oxidative stress, result in immunotoxicity, DNA damage, reduce reproduction significantly, and induce behavioral changes. Marine bivalves are commonly used as bioindicators for marine pollution, and hemolymph is a metabolite transfer medium for PAH pollutant. However, the vital immune indicator responses of pearl oyster Pinctada martensii hemolymph exposed to pyrene is still unclear. Thus, the immunotoxic responses of pyrene on the hemolymph of the Pinctada martensii were investigated in this study. After exposure to pyrene for 7 days, the total number of hemocytes (THC), cell membrane stability (CMS), phagocytic activity (PA) and total glutathione (GSHT) all decreased significantly. Pyrene also caused a significant increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO). Median effective concentrations (EC50) of pyrene on THC (4.5 mu g L-1) and LPO (5.2 mu g L-1) were lower than those for CMS (13.8 mu g L-1), PA (12.1 mu g L-1) and GSHT (7.2 mu g L-1), which indicates that THC and LPO were more sensitive. Additionally, a clear dose-effect relationship indicated that pyrene stimulated a marked immune response, as well as oxidative stress in P. martensii, which demonstrates the subtle effects of pyrene exposure on marine invertebrates and the potential associated risk.

Meanwhile, the effector caspase HrCas3 showed a complete sequence of 1404 bp, a 5'UTR of 82 bp, and a 3'UTR of 574 bp. The ORF of this caspase had 747 bp that coded for 248 residues. Moreover, the predicted molecular mass of HrCas3 was 29.4 kDa; the theoretical isoelectric point was 5.70, and the sequence evidenced a conserved caspase recruitment domain (CARD). The distribution of the caspases in distinct tissues revealed that HrCas8 was principally expressed in the hemolymph, while HrCas3 had a higher expression in the gills. A basal level of expression was found for both caspases in muscle tissue. The immune response of caspases in H. rufescens was evaluated through an injection of Vibrio anguillarum.

In this study, a transcriptome analysis was performed to identify the related genes in this hybrid abalone under thermal stress and recovery stage. Compared to control group (18 degrees C), a total of 75, 2173, 1050, 1349, 2548, 494, and 305 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at 21 degrees C, 24 degrees C, 27 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 32 degrees C, 29 degrees C, and 26 degrees C, respectively. In this study, 24 degrees C is the critical temperature at which the abalone is subjected to thermal stress. With the temperature rising, the number of stress-responsive genes increased. During the temperature recovering to the optimum, the number of stress-responsive genes decreased gradually. Thus, this hybrid abalone has a rapid response and strong adaptability to the temperature. Under the thermal stress, the abalone triggered a complicated regulatory network including degrading the misfolded proteins, activating immune systems, negative regulation of DNA replication, and activating energy production processes. The more quickly feedback regulation, more abundant energy supply and more powerful immune system might be the underlying mechanisms to fight against thermal stress in this hybrid abalone.

Results showed that the abalone fed 1.31 mg kg(-1) of dietary Se had the lowest Cu concentration in shell, muscle, mantle, gill, hepatopancreas and serum. Meanwhile, the significant lowest contents of malondiadehyde and protein carbonyl in hepatopancreas were also found in the treatment with 1.31 mg kg(-1) of dietary Se (P < 0.05). In addition, this treatment had significant higher glutathione content and thioredoxin reductase activity in hepatopancreas (P < 0.05). However, the activity of Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase (Se-GPx) was significantly decreased in the treatment with 4.20 mg kg(-1) of dietary Se (P < 0.05). In this treatment, the protein carbonyl content in hepatopancreas was significantly higher than that in the group with 1.31 mg kg(-1) of dietary Se (P < 0.05). In conclusion, in terms of anti-oxidation and Cu accumulation, the protective effects of dietary Se on abalone against waterborne Cu were dose-dependent. The 1.31 mg kg(-1) of dietary Se had this effect, but not 4.20 mg kg(-1) of dietary Se. Moreover, the latter increased the oxidative stress in abalone exposed to the waterborne Cu.",10.1111/are.12773

The role of polyunsaturated fatty acids of macroalgae in abalone nutrition",1996,AQUACULTURE,139,1-Feb,77,89,,"This study was undertaken to evaluate the nutritional role of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in dietary macroalgae for the abalone, Haliotis tuberculata and Haliotis discus hannai. The effects of five species of macroalgae (Alaria esculenta, Laminaria digitata, Laminaria saccharina, Palmaria palmata and Ulva lactuca) on specific growth rates (SGR) of the abalone and, the relationship between abalone SGR and fatty acid profiles in the algae were investigated. The current study confirmed our previous findings. Based on SGR the dietary values of these macroalgae can be listed in a decreasing order as follows: P. palmata, A. esculenta, U. lactuca, L. digitata and L. saccharina for H. tuberculata and, A. esculenta, P. palmata, L. digitata, L. saccharina and LI. lactuca for H. discus hannai. Fatty acid analysis revealed that C-18 and C-20 PUFA, such as 18:4n-3, 18:3n-3, 20:4n-6 and 20:5n-3, were dominant in the brown algae, A. esculenta, L. digitata and L. saccharina. The red alga, P. palmata, was characterised by the highest proportion of 20:5n-3 among the selected algae. In the green alga, Li. lactuca, however, the dominant PUFA were C-16 and C-18 fatty acids, while C-20 fatty acids were minimal. All the selected algae consistently contained very low levels of C-22 fatty acids. Statistical analyses demonstrated that (a) 20:5n-3 played a prominent role in the nutrition of both abalone species; (b) 18:3n-3 as well as other n-3 PUFA, and 18:2n-6 together with other n-3,6 long-chained PUFA also contributed to the faster growth of H. tuberculata and H. discus hannai, respectively. The results suggest that the PUFA of both n-3 and n-6 families seem to be essential for growth of H. discus hannai; for H. tuberculata, however, growth enhancement appeared to depend largely on n-3 PUFA.",10.1016/0044-8486(95)01158-7
"Ok, JH; Jeong, HJ; Lim, AS; Lee, KH",Interactions between the mixotrophic dinoflagellate Takayama helix and common heterotrophic protists,2017,HARMFUL ALGAE,68,,178,191,,"The phototrophic dinoflagellate Takayama helix that is known to be harmful to abalone larvae has recently been revealed to be mixotrophic. Although mixotrophy elevates the growth rate of T. helix by 79%-185%, its absolute growth rate is still as low as 0.3 d(-1). Thus, if the mortality rate of T. helix due to predation is high, this dinoflagellate may not easily prevail. To investigate potential effective protistan grazers on T helix, feeding by diverse heterotrophic dinoflagellates such as engulfment-feeding Oxyrrhis marina, Gyrodinium dominans, Gyrodinium moestrupii, Polykrikos kofoidii, and Noctiluca scintillans, peduncle feeding Aduncodinium glandula, Gyrodiniellum shiwhaense, Luciella masanensis, and Pfiesteria piscicida, pallium-feeding Oblea rotunda and Protoperidinium pellucidum, and the naked ciliates Pelagostrobilidium sp. (ca. 40 mu m in cell length) and Strombidinopsis sp. (ca. 150 mu m in cell length) on T: helix was explored. Among the tested heterotrophic protists, O. marina, G. dominans, G. moestrupii, A. glandula, L. masanensis, P. kofoidii, P. piscicida, and Strombidinopsis sp. were able to feed on T. helix. The growth rates of all these predators except Strombidinopsis sp. with T. helix prey were lower than those without the prey. The growth rate of Strombidinopsis sp. on T. helix was almost zero although the growth rate of Strombidinopsis sp. with T. helix prey was higher than those without the prey. Moreover, T. helix fed on O. marina and P. pellucidum and lysed the cells of P. kofoidii and G. shiwhaense. With increasing the concentrations of T. helix, the growth rates of O. marina and P. kofoidii decreased, but those of G. dominans and L. masanensis largely did not change. Therefore, reciprocal predation, lysis, no feeding, and the low ingestion rates of the common protists preying on T. helix may result in a low mortality rate due to predation, thereby compensating for this species' low growth rate.

"Bieler, R; Collins, TM; Golding, R; Rawlings, TA",A novel and enigmatic two-holed shell aperture in a new species of suspension-feeding worm-snail (Vermetidae),2019,PEERJ,7,,,,e6569,"Shell aperture modifications are well known in terrestrial and aquatic gastropods, with apertural lip thickening and tooth development common in species with terminal (determinate) shell growth. In contrast, secondary shell openings are rare in snails and are largely limited to slit shells, keyhole limpets, and abalone of the Vetigastropoda. When such features occur in other groups, they are noteworthy and raise interesting questions concerning the functional/adaptive significance of these shell modifications. Here we report on one such modification in a newly described species of vermetid snail. Members of the worm-snail family Vermetidae are sessile, suspension-feeding caenogastropods found in warm temperate to tropical marine environments worldwide. As juveniles, vermetids permanently cement their shells to hard substrata and subsequently produce irregularly coiled polychaete-like shell tubes with indeterminate growth and typically a simple circular shell aperture. In one previously studied group (genus Cupolaconcha), the aperture can be covered by a shell dome with a central slit that retains its widest opening in the center of the aperture. Vermetid specimens collected in the barrier reefs of Belize and the Florida Keys show an extreme aperture modification previously unknown in Gastropoda, in which the shell opening is covered by an apertural dome that leaves two equal-sized circular holes, each corresponding to the inflow and outflow water exchange currents of the animal's mantle cavity. The function of this perforated apertural dome is unknown, and it is in some ways antithetical to the suspension feeding habit of these snails. Further field and laboratory-based studies will be needed to clarify the functional significance and trade-offs of this unique morphology. The new taxon, which is not closely related to the previously described dome-building Glade Cupolaconcha, is described and named as Vermetus biperforatus Bieler, Collins, Golding & Rawlings n. sp.",10.7717/peerj.6569

Juvenile snails (average weight, 32 +/- A 0.7 mg) were randomly distributed in forty-eight 25-L aquaria (16 L water each) in a flow-through system at a density of 130 snails per aquarium. Three replicate groups of snails were fed one of the experimental diets ad libitum once per day for 10 weeks. At the end of the feeding experiment, survival of snails was above 98% and not significantly different among the dietary treatments. The best final body weight was observed in snails fed the SBM and WF diets. There were no significant differences in final body weight of snails fed the F-SBM, WF, F-WF and MIX diets, but the value was higher than that of snails fed the FM, F-FM, FWP and F-FWP diets. The lowest value was observed in snails fed the SSM, F-SSM, SCR and F-SCR diets. Whole body protein and lipid contents of snails varied with dietary protein sources. Amino acid composition of whole body was altered by dietary protein sources. The results of the present study indicate that dietary protein sources significantly influence proximate and amino acid composition, and growth performance of snails. Fermentation with ferminpan instant brown yeast does not improve nutritional quality of the protein sources, and soybean meal and wheat flour in combination with fish meal could be potential protein sources in feeds for juvenile snails.",10.1007/s10499-009-9308-9

Abalone were initially fed a nutritionally balanced formulated diet. Both PUFA and HUFA were low in the experimental formulated diets. After 60 days, growth rates of abalone fed the formulated diets were low and probably reflective of a lack of sufficient essential fatty acids. However, the total lipid content of the muscle tissue of abalone fed diets LL and HL remained unchanged from that of the start,of the experiment. However, the level in the starved abalone was significantly higher (21.5%) than that of abalone at the start of the experiment. The percentage of polar lipid and neutral lipid in the abalone muscle tissue ranged from 70.8% to 76.1% and 23.9% to 29.2%, respectively. Levels of 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3 and 22:5n-3 in the polar lipid of the muscle of the starved abalone significantly increased while levels of 20:4n-6 and 20:5n-3 in the neutral lipid for abalone in all treatments decreased, suggesting the essentiality of these HUFA. Levels of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 in the polar lipid of the tissue of the starved abalone were significantly higher than the levels of these respective fatty acids in the abalone fed diets HL and LL. These higher levels probably reflect the weight loss associated with starvation combined with lipid not being used as an energy source. More research directed toward the determination of the fatty acid requirements of postlarvae and for successful maturation and a spawning of abalone needs to be conducted. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Undaria is an important species for both the abalone industry and for commercial seaweed mariculture. In an attempt to extend the culture period of Undaria we bred and cultured hybrid kelp that is a cross between free-living gametophytes of U. peterseniana and Undariopsis pinnatifida. The morphological characteristics of the F-1 hybrid sporophytes were intermediate between those of the parent plants having shallow pinnated blades and forming both sorus and sporophyll. A F-2 generation was produced by isolating zoospores from sorus and sporophyll separately from a F-1 hybrid thallus. Using free-living gametophyte seeding and standard on-growing techniques, F-0 (female U. pinnatifida and male U. peterseniana), F-1, and F-2 gametophytes were cultured from December 2011 to May 2013. The morphological differences between the F-1 and F-2 generations were assessed. The F-2 hybrids were found to have longer pinnate blades and narrower midribs than the F-1 hybrid and only formed sporophylls. Growth and morphology of F-2 hybrids originating from the sporophyll or sorus of the F-1 hybrids were not morphologically different from each other. Both of the F-2 hybrids exhibited late maturation, with the early stages of sporophylls appearing in April. This late maturation of F-2 hybrids is beneficial in the development of hybrid strains that extend the period of availability of Undaria for abalone feed and cultivation in Korea.",10.1007/s10811-013-0164-7

Unlike other IGFBPs, there is no knowledge available on aquatic invertebrate IGFBP7. In this study, a molluscan IGFBP7 gene, saIGFBP7, was cloned for the first time from the small abalone Haliotis diversicolor. Its full-length cDNA sequence is 1812 bp, with a 720 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 239 aa. The molecular mass of the deduced protein is approximately 25.37 kDa with an estimated pl of 5.00, and it shares highest 41% identity to IGFBP7 of Amblyomma americanum. Analysis of conserved domains revealed the presence of an IGFBP N-terminal domain (IB), a kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor domain (KI), and an immunoglobulin-like C2 domain (IgC2) in saIGFBP7. Furthermore, the 12 cysteine residues and the signature amino acid motif 'xCGCCxxC' which are characterized by the amino terminus region of the IGFBP superfamily are all presented in saIGFBP7. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot were employed to investigate the tissue distribution of saIGFBP7, and its expression under bacterial challenge. The saIGFBP7 mRNA and protein could be detected in all examined tissues, with the highest expression level in hemocytes, higher expression level in gills, and was up-regulated in hemocytes and gills after bacterial injection. In addition, saIGFBP7 mRNA transcripts were observed in a subset of the branchial epithelium and the nucleus of hemocytes using the in situ hybridization method. Interestingly, saIGFBP7 was detected mainly in the goblet-like cell of the branchial epithelium by immunohistochemistry. These results suggested that saIGFBP7 was likely to be involved in a function associated with pathogenic infection and may play an important role in the adult abalone immune system.

In the present study, two MyD88 variants were identified from disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) and designated AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X. The deduced AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X comprised 433 and 354 amino acids with predicted molecular masses of 48.85 kDa and 40.17 kDa, respectively. AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X possessed typical MyD88 domain structural features including an N-terminal death domain (DD) and C-terminal toll interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain similar to those in mammals. Expression analysis of AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X mRNA at different early embryonic developmental stages of abalone by qPCR revealed that their constitutive expression at all developmental stages analyzed with the considerably higher values at the 16-cell (AbMyD88-2) and morula stages (AbMyD88-X). In unchallenged disk abalones, AbMyD88-2 was highly expressed in muscles, while AbMyD88-X mRNA was predominantly transcribed in hemocytes. Moreover, AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X mRNA were differentially modulated in abalone hemocytes after a challenge with live bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes), virus (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus), and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (lipopolysaccharides and Poly I:C). Overexpression of AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X in HEK293T cells induced the activation of the NF-kappa B promoter. AbMyD882 and AbMyD88-X involvement in inflammatory responses was characterized by their overexpression in RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells. These results revealed comparatively higher NO (Nitric oxide) production, induction of inflammatory mediator genes (iNOS and COX2), and proinflammatory genes (IL1 beta, IL6 and TNF alpha) expression in abalone MyD88s-overexpressing cells than in mock control in the presence or absence of LPS stimulation. Altogether, these results suggest that existence of a MyD88dependent like signaling pathway in disk abalone and that both AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X might be involved in innate immune and inflammatory responses. 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The gut-bacterial composition of Haliotis midae (5-9 mm) weaned onto either a commercial formulated feed (Abfeed-S34), fresh kelp (Ecklonia maxima), or a commercial formulated feed containing kelp (E. maxima) (Abfeed-S34K) was compared. The gut microbiota of postsettlement diatom-fed abalone was dominated by Planctomycetes. Weaning to kelp or formulated feed resulted in a significant difference in the gut-bacterial communities, with the Firmicutes becoming dominant in the kelp-fed treatment and the Proteobacteria dominating in the two formulated feed treatments (analysis of similarities: R = 0.77, P = 0.02). The gut microbiota of kelp-fed abalone displayed a relatively low diversity compared with that of abalone fed formulated feeds and was dominated by fermentative Clostridia bacteria. There was no difference in gut-bacterial communities of the abalone fed commercial formulated feed with or without kelp inclusion. The dominance of the Clostridia in the kelp-fed abalone guts is explained by the large volume of fermentable polysaccharides present in macroalgae, whereas the energy-rich formulated feeds appeared to reduce the selectivity of the gut environment resulting in a relatively higher bacterial diversity.",10.2983/035.037.0117

Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that marine bivalves, including scallops, are vulnerable to OA due to their poor capacities to regulate extracellular ions and acid-based status. However, the physiological mechanisms of scallops responding to OA are not well understood. In this study, we evaluated the effects of 45 days of exposure to OA (pH 7.5) on the energy metabolism and antioxidant capability of Yesso scallops. Some biochemical markers related to energy metabolism (e.g., content of glycogen and ATP, activity of ATPase, lactate dehydrogenase, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase), antioxidant capacity (e.g., reactive oxygen species level, activity of superoxide dismutase, and catalase) and cellular damage (e.g., lipid peroxidation level) were measured. Our results demonstrate that the effects of the reduced pH (7.5) on scallops are varied in different tissues. The energy reserves are mainly accumulated in the adductor muscle and hepatopancreas. Yesso scallops exhibit energy modulation by increasing lactate dehydrogenase activities to stimulate anaerobic metabolism. The highly active Na+/K+-ATPase and massive ATP consumption in the mantle and gill indicate that a large amount of energy was allocated for the ion regulation process to maintain the acid-base balance in the reduced-pH environment. Moreover, the increase in the reactive oxygen species level and the superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in the gill and adductor muscle, indicate that oxidative stress was induced after long-term exposure to the reduced-pH environment. Our findings indicate that the effects of OA are tissue-specific, and physiological homeostasis could be modulated through different mechanisms for Yesso scallops.",10.3389/fphys.2018.01967

First identified in black abalone in California after an El Nino event, withering syndrome (WS) has caused large declines in wild black and captive white abalone on the northeastern Pacific coast, but disease resistance levels are species-, and possibly population-specific. This study compared gene expression patterns in the digestive gland of Ca. Xc-exposed and unexposed (control) Pinto abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana), a particularly susceptible species. Lab-induced Ca. Xc infections were followed over 7 months and RNAseq was used to identify differential gene expression. Exposed Pinto abalone showed distinct changes in expression of 68 genes at 3 and 7 months post-infection relative to those in control animals. Upregulation of an orexin-like receptor (which is involved in feeding signaling) and a zinc peptidase-like region (many amino peptidases are zinc peptidases) in animals infected for 7 months indicates that animals with Ca. Xc infection may be starving and upregulating processes associated with feeding and digestion.

No patterns emerged in genes known to be involved in molluscan immune response, despite this being an expectation during a 7-month infection; digestion-related genes and unannotated DEGs were identified as targets for future research on potential immune response to WS in abalone.",10.1016/j.cbd.2021.100930

Unpredictable water temperature fluctuations, especially those caused by climate change, may negatively affect feed consumption and growth of cultured organisms, such as abalone. In addition, metabolic and nutritional changes across different seasons may have significant effects on aquaculture production. This study aimed to investigate biochemical and metabolic alterations in healthy abalone (Haliotis iris) during 1 year of grow out in a land-based farm in New Zealand. Proximate analyses were used to identify nutritional variations in whole animal tissues, and a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach was used to identify metabolic changes in adductor muscle of abalone during different seasons in the 1-year sampling period. Results showed that protein content was higher in warmer months compared with colder months, whereas lipid, ash, and carbohydrate contents remained generally constant throughout the year. Metabolic profile fluctuations indicated higher amounts of glutamic acid, glutathione, methionine, lysine, serine, tyrosine, and glycine in January and March compared with October and July, indicating possible amino acid breakdown and collagen degradation due to warmer temperatures. Although the proximate analyses findings revealed no signs of nutritional deficiencies in abalone among seasons, the metabolic profiles suggested possible thermal stress during summer months. This study provides a foundation for further nutritional studies to optimise seasonal diets for farmed Haliotis iris and highlights the need to monitor thermal stress effects, especially during summer and/or heatwave events.",10.1155/2023/3297576

Experimental animals (initial weight: 7.49 g +/- 0.01 g) were exposed to graded concentrations of waterborne Cu (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08 mg L-1) or Cd (0.025, 0.05, 0.25, 0.5 mg L-1) for 28 days, respectively. Activities of the anti-oxidative enzymes (catalase, CAT; superoxide dismutase, SOD; glutathione peroxidases, GPx; glutathione S-transferase, GST), contents of the reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondiadehyde (MDA) in the hepatopancreas, and metal accumulation in hepatopancreas and muscles were analyzed after 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28 days of metal exposure, respectively. Results showed that 0.04 mg L-1, 0.06 mg L-(-1) and 0.08 mg L-1 Cu caused 100% death of abalone on the 21st, 10(th) and 6(th) day, respectively. However, no dead abalone was found during the 28-day waterborne Cd exposure at all experimental concentrations. Generally, activities of SOD and GST in hepatopancreas under all Cu concentrations followed a decrease trend as the exposure time prolonged. However, these activities were firstly increased and then decreased to the control level and increased again during Cd exposure. Activities of CAT in all Cu exposure treatments were higher than those in the control. These activities were firstly increased and then decreased to the control level and increased again during Cd exposure. Contents of MDA in hepatopancreas in all Cu treatments significantly increased first and then decreased to the control level. However, the MDA contents in hepatopancreas were not significantly changed during the 28-day Cd exposure. The metals accumulation in both hepatopancreas and muscles of abalone significantly increased with the increase of waterborne metals concentration and exposure time. These results indicated that H. discus hannai has a positive anti-oxidative defense against Cu or Cd.

To facilitate the restoration of wild stocks of Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) and increase the success rate of release, abalones were monitored for 24 h without interruption in an experimental unit (developed in-house) to assess the flow velocity preferences of marine mollusks. Abalones tended to keep away from areas with higher flow velocities (> 5 cm/s) and they preferred to stay in areas with lower flow velocities (< 5 cm/s). Comparative study of the diurnal behavioral characteristics of abalones under seven different flow velocities (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 cm/s) showed that the cumulative distance moved, movement duration, and feeding time decreased significantly as the flow velocity increased. At flow velocities over 20 cm/s, abalones barely moved or consumed food, and cosine rhythm analysis demonstrated that the diurnal rhythms of behavioral parameters disappeared and the peak movement phase occurred earlier than expected. In addition, increasing the flow velocity reduced the spacing between individuals and the polarity of movement was higher. Individuals changed their coordination levels in groups as an active adaptation to changes in the flow velocity. These findings provide new insights into the ecological habits of abalones. Based on the characteristic movement behaviors of abalones at different flow velocities, bottom-sowing should be conducted in areas with a flow velocity < 5 cm/s instead of areas with a flow velocity > 20 cm/s to improve the efficiency of bottom-sowing stock enhancement.",10.1016/j.gecco.2024.e02823

In this study, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were tested to detect nutritional sources during the early life stages of the abalone Haliotis discus hannai in laboratory experiments to evaluate stable isotope analyses as an appropriate investigative tool for field studies. Fertilized eggs, larvae, and the parent spawner muscle were analyzed to detect a nutritional source during the nonfeedine period. The delta C-13 of fertilized eggs showed slight depletion, about 2 parts per thousand, compared with that of the parent muscle, and was not detectable after lipid extraction of fertilized eggs. As for the larvae, the isotopic values in postlarvae after settlement and metamorphosis were 2 parts per thousand more enriched, become similar to that of the spawner muscle. These results imply that the lipid portion of the eggs is the primary nutritional source during the nonfeeding period of abalone. Laboratory feeding experiments were conducted during which early postlarval abalone (approximately 1 mm in shell length (SL)) were reared for 7 days and supplied with 4 benthic diatoms respectively. The benthic diatom Cylindrotheca closterium produced high growth and survival rates for early postlarval abalone, and there was a significant isotopic shift in their delta C-13, approaching that of C. closterium. Larger postlarval abalone (SL, >1.3 mm) were fed 1 of 5 benthic diatoms and a gametophyte of a macroalga, Undaria pinnatifida, for 21 days. Isotopic changes approaching. the delta C-13 of the provided benthic diatoms were detected from postlarvae fed the benthic diatoms Achnanthes longipes, Cocconeis scutellum, C. closterium, and the gametophyte of U. pinnatifida, which provided high survival rates and growth rates for the postlarvae. From these results, stable isotope ratios of postlarval abalone are suggested to be useful to infer the origin of the assimilated diets. The current study highlights that stable isotope ratios are a promising tool to investigate the diet composition of postlarval abalone in their natural habitat as well as in abalone hatcheries.",10.2983/035.029.0315

Abalones (initial weight: 10.98 +/- 0.05 g) were fed with graded levels of dietary lipid (1.57%, 2.34%, 3.17%, 3.82%, 4.63%, 5.56%, 6.17% and 6.72%). Results showed that weight gain rate (WGR) and increment in shell length of abalone were highest in 3.82% dietary lipid level. Based on the quadratic regression analysis for WGR, the optimal dietary lipid level for abalone was estimated to be 3.87%. Concentrations of the total triacylglycerol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-esterified fatty acids in serum as well as lipid contents in hepatopancreas and muscle were positively related to dietary lipid levels. Compared to the group with 3.82% of dietary lipid, higher (6.72%) and lower (1.57%) dietary lipid down regulated the expression of genes involved in fatty acids transport and lipolysis in hepatopancreas and muscle, which might be related to AMP-activated protein kinase alpha 2 (AMPK alpha 2)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) signaling. Higher dietary lipid (6.72%) down regulated, while lower dietary lipid (1.57%) up-regulated the expressions of genes involved in de-novo lipogenesis in hepatopancreas. Both higher (6.72%) and lower (1.57%) dietary lipid down regulated these genes' expression in muscle. It was found that c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) signaling participate in the regulation of de-novo lipogenesis.

Here, we studied the effects of dietary protein/lipid ratios on the growth and folate metabolism of juvenile clam Sinonovacula constricta. Four microcapsule feeds were formulated with different protein (27-48 %) and lipid (2-14 %) levels, designated as follows: P48L2 (48 % protein and 2 % lipid), P41L6, P34L10, and P27L14 groups. Clams, initially measuring 2.7 +/- 0.08 mm in shell length, were fed these diets for a period of 14 days. Results showed the optimal dietary protein/lipid ratio for juvenile clams was predicted to be 4.6. The lipid level of clam exhibited an upward trend as the dietary protein/lipid ratio decreased, and the appropriate protein/lipid ratio enhanced the activities of amylase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. Transcriptome analysis showed that the pyrimidine/purine metabolism and one carbon pool by folate in the clam fed P41L6 diet was downregulated relative to those fed P34L10 and P27L14 diets. Meanwhile, compared with P34L10 group, the clam in the P41L6 group exhibited decreased levels of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and folate, and increased levels of L-methionine and S-adenosylmethionine. Our results for the first time revealed that the optimal dietary protein/lipid ratio for clam was 4.6. Furthermore, the high-protein/low-lipid diet may inhibit growth by causing abnormal accumulation of metabolites in the methionine cycle and inhibiting the folate metabolism, ultimately resulting in reduced purine and pyrimidine synthesis. Our findings may provide indispensable theoretical support for formulating feeds of clam and understanding the relationship between dietary nutrient intake ratios and folatemediated one-carbon metabolism.",10.1016/j.aqrep.2025.102707

Thioredoxin acts as an active regulatory enzyme to eliminate excessive reactive oxygen species, thereby preventing cellular damage. In this study, the cDNA sequence of thioredoxin domain-containing 5 (AbTXNDC5) from the disk abalone transcriptomic database was characterized. An in silico analysis of AbTXNDC5 was performed, and its spatial and temporal expression patterns in hemocytes and gills in response to bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes), viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, and pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules were observed. Furthermore, AbTXNDC5 expression was examined in different developmental stages. Functional assays to explore insulin disulfide reduction, antiapoptotic activity, and protection against hypoxic cell death of AbTXNDC5 were conducted through recombinant proteins or overexpression in cells. AbTXNDC5 contains a 1179-bp open reading frame coding for 392 amino acids. Conserved thiol-disulfide cysteine residues within two Cys-X-X-Cys motifs were found in AbTXNDC5. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction indicated that healthy digestive tract and hemocyte tissues expressed high levels of AbTXNDC5 mRNA, which may protect the host from invading pathogens. Immune challenged abalone hemocytes and gills exhibited upregulated expression of AbTXNDC5 at different time points. rAbTXNDC5 also exhibited a functional insulin disulfide reductase activity. AbTXNDC5 conferred protection to cultured cells from apoptosis and hypoxia-induced stress, compared to the pcDNA3.1((+)) transfected control cells.

A novel haplosporidian was associated with high mortalities (82.5-90%) of cultured juvenile paua (Haliotis iris) in New Zealand. Disease outbreaks among cultured abalone in Tasmania, Australia were associated with two species of Vibrio (V. harveyi and V. splendidus I) and a Flavobacterium-like bacterium with stress factors precipitating the diseases in most cases. The agent of withering syndrome responsible for mass mortalities of black abalone (H. cracherodii) in southern California was identified as the Rickettsiales-like prokaryote Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis. The exotic sabellid polychaete that seriously impacted abalone culture in California was named Terebrasabella heterouncinata and experimentally found to reproduce at low temperatures but with a significantly temperature-dependant generation time (a developmental cycle of 298 days at 11.2degreesC in comparison to 165 days at 15.6degreesC). To assess the health of cultured abalone, histologic examinations are essential. For histology, tissue samples (less than 1 cm thick) should be fixed in Davidson's solution or 10% formalin in seawater such that there is at least 10 parts fixative to 1 part tissue. Histopathology will not only indicate the presence of infectious agents but can be useful for monitoring the suitability of the diet and aquaculture environment.

The antioxidant enzymes include Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), catalase (CAT), mu-glutathione-s-transferase (mu-GST) and thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx). The results showed that the mRNA expression of these antioxidant enzymes increased and reached the maximum at the dietary zinc level of 33.8 mg/kg, and then dropped progressively. Expression levels of the heat shock proteins (HSP26, HSP70 and HSP90) firstly increased at 33.8 mg/kg dietary Zn level, and reached to the maximum at 710.6 mg/kg then dropped at 3462.5 mg/kg (p<0.05).

Selection for phenotypically plastic antiherbivory responses has been suggested for many plants, including a few species of seaweed, but little is known about its specificity or seasonality. 2 Multi-factorial experiments tested the effects of consumer identity (Littorina brevicula vs. Haliotis discus) and season (summer vs. autumn) on the induction of antiherbivory defences in the brown seaweed Ecklonia cava. Following a grazer-free acclimation phase, algae were incubated with grazers (treatment phase) and, subsequently, without grazers (recovery phase).

Lower proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids (12% and 9%) compared with monounsaturated (44% and 45%) and saturated fatty acids (32% and 34%) were present in eggs of conditioned and wild caught broodstock respectively. Relative amounts of individual saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were similar in eggs of both wild caught and conditioned broodstock. The relative proportions of some polyunsaturated fatty acids of the broodstock diets were reflected in the eggs and varied between batches of conditioned and wild broodstock. Formulated feed has high linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and the proportion of this fatty acid was 10 times higher in eggs spawned from animals fed formulated feed than in eggs of wild caught broodstock. Eggs derived from wild broodstock, which feed preferentially on red seaweeds, showed about twice as much arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) compared with eggs from conditioned broodstock, which were supplied with a formulated diet low in arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is a major precursor of prostaglandins, which play a vital role in molluscan reproduction. In this study, the levels of ARA were higher in eggs than in the respective diets of the broodstock, except of the Gracilaria diet, indicating that ARA was preferentially incorporated into the eggs of broodstock feeding on formulated feed and Ulva australis. Results from the present study demonstrate that 3 mo of feeding on an altered diet is sufficient to alter the fatty acid profile of the eggs. This study shows high variability in diameter, weight, and biochemical composition of eggs between batches and spawning seasons. We present initial evidence that smaller eggs had higher lipid content with a higher larval hatch rate than larger eggs. In addition, larval settlement was negatively correlated with egg moisture.",

Abalone in the stimulant experiment exhibited a typical feeding Posture almost immediately, were more alert, and engaged in a greater range of feeding activities than the abalone that had been supplied with commercial food only. Those abalone without access to the algal stimulant remained either quiescent or alert in most seasons. Feeding activity of abalone in the stimulant treatment was significantly higher (P < 0.05) as compared with abalone from the nonstimulant control for all seasons except winter. Also, abalone consumed significantly more artificial food when tactile stimulants were present during autumn and winter. However, ingestion rates seemed highly sensitive to both season and acclimation time. Within each season, there was a consistent trend of increasing ingestion rate during the third week of the experiment, and this was most discernible in the stimulant treatment.",
"Soria, G; Merino, G; von Brand, E",Effect of increasing salinity on physiological response in juvenile scallops Argopecten purpuratus at two rearing temperatures,2007,AQUACULTURE,270,1-Apr,451,463,,"Argopecten purpuratus can be cultivated using Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) as a method to increase production. In order to determine physiological response of A. purpuratus under different salinities and temperature conditions, two groups of juvenile scallops (small: h=6.5 mm and large: h=25.5 mm) were acclimated and close-cultured at salinities of 34, 38, and 42 g/l, at 16 and 22 degrees C and fed on Isochrysis galbana and Chaetoceros calcitrans. Survival, shell growth and scope for growth were determined at the end of the trials. Survival showed an inverse relationship with temperature and ammonia levels. In small scallops an increase in salinity at 16 degrees C increased survival. However, this relationship was not evident at 22 degrees C. On the other hand, salinity did not affect survival of large juveniles. Small juveniles had a lower survival (approximately 40%) than larger scallops (up to 85%) throughout the trials. Oxygen consumption was not affected by salinity. Small scallops showed similar oxygen consumption at 16 and 22 degrees C but in large juveniles higher values were registered at 22 degrees C. In large juveniles routine consumption at 16 degrees C was higher (up to 35%) than standard consumption. This pattern was not evident at 22 degrees C, suggesting that oxygen demand is higher regardless of feeding condition. NH4+-N excretion rate is inversely related to salinity. Only small juveniles showed a higher NH4+-N excretion rate at 22 degrees C. Scope for growth was positive in all treatments, although the upper limit of salinity should not be based only in this index. Higher scope for growth values at 38 and 42 g/l was related with a reduction in ammonia excretion and high absorption efficiency. In addition, an increase in salinity produced a reduction in NH3-N proportion and under hypersaline conditions scallops tended to decrease excretion as a way of osmoconformation. This explains our findings of higher survival rates at higher salinities. Even though the scope for growth is positive at 42 g/l, the osmotic stress reduces the survival chances. The data obtained can be considered useful information for A. purpuratus culture under controlled conditions. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2007.05.018

The experimental diets containing graded levels of dietary iron (24.9-212.7 mg iron/kg) provided as either FeMet or FeSO4 were fed to juvenile abalone. Abalone juveniles of similar size were distributed in a flow-through system using a completely randomized design with thirteen treatments and three replicates of each treatment. Abalone fed the basal diet without iron supplementation exhibited significantly lower survival and carcass protein than the other groups. The average weight gain rate (WGR, %). daily increment in shell length (DISL, mum/day), and soft-body iron concentration (SB iron. mug/g) of the abalone were significantly affected by dietary treatment, and responded in broken-lint models to increases in dietary iron levels from the two iron sources. The optimal levels of dietary iron using FeMet and FeSO4 as the supplemental iron sources, determined by broken-line regression analysis, on the basis of maximum WGR, were 62.79 and 58.35 mg/kg, respectively. On maximum DISL, the values were 66.12 and 62.11 mg/kg, respectively, and on maximum SE iron deposition were 66.78 and 64.55 mg/kg, respectively. The content of iron and manganese in the shell, however, was maintained relatively constant regardless of dietary treatment. Significantly reduced manganese deposition in soft-body parts was observed for the abalone Fed diets containing high levels (greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg) of iron From FeSO4. However, this effect of excess iron on the utilization of manganese was not found when using FeMet as the iron source. Based on these results, an optimal level of dietary iron was recommended to be 65-70 mg/kg with either FeMet or FeSO4 as the iron source. This experiment also showed that the bioavailability of dietary iron from FeSO4 was as high as that from FeMet.",

Nine experimental diets in a 3 & times; 3 two-factor design were formulated with different carbohydrate levels (27.5%, 32% and 36.5%) and vitamin D3 levels (0, 1000 IU/kg and 5000 IU/kg). Results showed that the highest specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone was observed in the treatment with 36.5% of dietary carbohydrate and 1000 IU/kg of vitamin D3. The serum glucose, body crude lipid and muscle glycogen contents of abalone significantly increased with increasing dietary carbohydrate levels (P < 0.05). Diet with 1000 IU/kg of vitamin D3 significantly reduced the serum glucose and body crude lipid content (P < 0.05). Significant interactions between dietary carbohydrate and vitamin D3 were observed in SGR and crude lipid content (P < 0.05). Diet with 36.5% carbohydrate up-regulated the expression of pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate (IRS), protein kinase B (Akt), glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase (PYG), whereas decreased the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6P) and glycogen synthesis kinase-3 beta. Diet with 1000 IU/kg of vitamin D3 significantly up-regulated the hexokinase, IR, IRS, Akt and glucose transporter 1 mRNA levels, whereas decreased the G6PDH (P < 0.05). The interaction between dietary carbohydrate and vitamin D3 were significant on PEPCK, G6P, G6PDH and PYG mRNA levels (P < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary carbohydrates and vitamin D3 could affect glucose metabolism by regulating glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and pentose phosphate pathway in abalone. Besides, they triggered the insulin signaling pathway, and further influence glucose transport and glycogen synthesis, which could promote the utilization of carbohydrate in abalone.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.736908

Post-larvae showed active feeding behaviour an all diatom strains. Two strains (Achnanthes longipes-l and Nitzschia sp.) produced significantly faster growth (means 34-35 mu m shell length per day) than the remaining six strains (means 11-17 mu m/day). The two fast-growth strains were efficiently digested by post-larvae, with 93-94% of live cells ruptured during passage through the gut. Two of the remaining strains could not be ingested during the growth experiment because the cells were too large (A. longipes-2) or too strongly attached (Cocconeis pseudomarginata). For the other four strains (Navicula britannica, Nav. ramosissima, Navicula sp. and Nitzschia ovalis) most cells passed through the gut alive. Survival rate was highest on the two fast-growth strains, and survival was positively correlated with both growth rate (r = 0.73, P < 0.05) and digestion efficiency (r= 0.80, P < 0.05) of diatoms. The digestion efficiency of diatom strains appears to be an important factor determining their dietary value. Digestion efficiency can be influenced by diatom morphology, attachment strength, frustule strength and post-larval age/size. Isolation and use of digestible strains may improve hatchery culture of abalone. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.",10.1016/S0044-8486(97)00223-8

The ability to optimize energy acquisition to this episodic thermal oscillation may determine the survival, growth and development of these ectotherms. We compared the physiological and molecular responses of Haliotis discus hannai cultivated in suspended cages to fluctuating or stable temperature conditions. Several physiological indicators (respiration, excretion rates and O:N) were measured in both conditions, and alterations in the proteome during thermal fluctuations were assessed. No summer mortality was observed in abalone cultivated in fluctuating temperatures compared with that at stable high temperatures. Metabolic rates increased sharply during stable warm summer conditions and fluctuated in accordance with short-term temperature fluctuations (20-26 degrees C). Ammonia excretion rates during acute responses were comparable in both conditions. When abalone were exposed to fluctuating temperatures, enzyme activities were downregulated and structure-related protein expression was upregulated compared with that at an acclimation temperature (26 degrees C), highlighting that exposure to low temperatures during fluctuations alters molecular processes. Our results reveal that modulation of physiological traits and protein expression during semidiurnal thermal fluctuations may buffer abalone from the lethal consequences of extreme temperatures in summer.",10.1038/s41598-019-44526-3

Changes in messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of melatonin receptor (MT-R), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and antioxidant enzymes, as well as alterations in H2O2 levels in the hemolymph, were examined. The results revealed that high-temperature-stressed abalones treated with melatonin injections or exposed to red LED light showed a significant increase in MT-R mRNA expression, while HSP70 mRNA expression decreased. Notably, HSP70 mRNA expression levels in the red LED light-irradiated group were similar to those in the group injected with 10(-8 )M melatonin after 24 h exposure. Abalones treated with melatonin at 20 degrees C or irradiated with red LED light exhibited decreased H2O2 levels and reduced antioxidant enzyme mRNA expression compared with those of the control group. However, the high-temperature environment induced oxidative stress in abalones, leading to increased antioxidant enzyme mRNA expression compared with that under 20 degrees C conditions. Moreover, abalones exposed to high-temperature stress exhibited hepatopancreatic DNA damage, which was attenuated by melatonin treatment or red LED light irradiation. Hence, red LED light reduces oxidative stress, boosts antioxidant enzymes, and alleviates DNA damage in high-temperature-stressed abalones, akin to 10(-8 )M melatonin treatment. Therefore, considering the practical challenges of continuous melatonin administration to abalones, utilizing red LED light emerges as a practical, effective alternative to protect abalones from oxidative stress compared to 10(-8 )M melatonin treatment.",10.1002/jez.2800

As the wild resources of Pacific abalone are on the verge of exhaustion, efforts to reveal the effects of predation by hostile organisms on the efficiency of its bottom sowing and proliferation are crucial for the success of resource restoration. In this study, abalone and its predator, starfish Asterias amurensis , were placed in a customized monitoring unit. Through continuous infrared video monitoring, predation pressure was found to cause a significant decrease in the distance moved, duration of movement, cumulative feeding duration and orexin levels in hemolymph ( P < 0.01). It also caused a significant increase in the average velocity of movement, group cohesion, coordination and cholecystokinin levels in hemolymph ( P < 0.01). Surprisingly, when a shelter was set up in the environment, the cumulative feeding duration of abalone was significantly extended in the presence of the predator ( P < 0.001), whereas when the predator was removed, the distance moved, duration of movement, and cumulative feeding duration of abalone were found to significantly increase during continuous 24 h monitoring ( P < 0.01).

The aim of this study was the understanding of a possible role of the p38 MAPK in abalone haemocyte responses towards this bacterium. First, the pathogenicity of different V. harveyi strains was compared in both immersion and injection trials, and clear differences were detected. The three strains, ORM4, 04/092, and 05/053, all isolated front moribund abalone, induced up to 80% mortalities in immersion or injection challenges (LD50 (ORM4) = 2.5 x 10(2) CFU animal(-1)). The two strains, LMG 4044T and LMG 7890 were non-pathogenic towards abalone in immersion trials, and needed very high numbers for killing by intramuscular injections (LD50 = 8.9 x 10(4) and 1.6 x 10(5) CFU animal(-1), respectively). To start unraveling the mechanism explaining these differences, the p38-MAPK, a keyplayer in antimicrobial immune response, was studied. The non-pathogenic strain, LMG 7890 can be eliminated by abalone haemocytes and induces haemocyte phagocytosis and high ROS production. With different concentrations of a p38-specific inhibitor, SB203580, p38 implication was shown. This inhibitor reduced phagocytosis and ROS induction leading to LMG 7890 proliferation. In the case of the pathogenic ORM4 which can not be eliminated by abalone haemocytes, no phagocytosis and ROS production was induced, and a retarded p38 activation was observed. Taken together, our results suggest that p38 MAPK modulation may be one of the ways of virulent V. harveyi to attack its host and escape abalone immune response. J. Cell. Biochem. 106: 152-160, 2009.

Proteinase inhibitors play a key role in regulating the activity of the respective proteinases. Among serine proteinase inhibitors, kazal-type proteinase inhibitors (KPIs) are widely found in mammals, avians, and a variety of invertebrates. In this study, we describe the identification of a kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor (Ab-KPI) from the disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus, which is presumably involved in innate immunity. The full-length cDNA of Ab-KPI includes 600 bp nucleotides with an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 143 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of Ab-KPI contains a putative 17-amino acid signal peptide and two tandem kazal domains with high similarity to other kazal-type SPIs. Each kazal domain consists of reactive site (P-1) residue containing a leucine (L), and a threonine (T) located in the second amino acid position after the second conserved cysteine of each domain. Temporal expression of Ab-KPI was assessed by real time quantitative PCR in hemocytes and mantle tissue following bacterial and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) challenge, and tissue injury. At 6 h post-bacterial and -VHSV challenge, Ab-KPI expression in hemocytes was increased 14-fold and 4-fold, respectively, compared to control samples. The highest up-regulations upon tissue injury were shown at 9 h and 12 h in hemocytes and mantle, respectively. The transcriptional modulation of Ab-KPI following bacterial and viral challenges and tissue injury indicates that it might be involved in immune defense as well as wound healing process in abalone.

Larvae of the abalone Haliotis discus hannai were offered, in a petri dish, a choice of several food patches, each made of a diatom monoculture layer. The distribution of the larval settlement on the patches of 17 diatom species was determined. Nitzschia laevis induced the most abalone larvae settlement, followed by Navicula cf lenzii and Amphora luciae. The attractiveness of these diatoms for abalone larvae settlement was not directly related to algal biochemical composition or algal color. It is suggested that compounds excreted by algal cells determine their inductive properties for larval settlement. The larval chemosensory response depends on the concentration of these inductive substances. Sonicated diatom cell suspensions strongly induced larvae attachment, whereas dilute suspensions did not. Boiling settlement-inductive sonicated diatom cell suspensions did not affect their induction ability, implying that native proteins are not essential for the response. Aspartic acid was the only free amino acid excreted by two tested diatoms. It was also the only pure amino acid found inductive for larval settlement. It is therefore suggested that aspartic acid is a component of the settlement induction complex.",

We also investigated the effects of these diets on serum lipid levels. Male rats were fed these diets for 23 days. Protein quality indicators (true digestibility, net protein utilization, biological value) were similar to those obtained for casein-based feeds except for lower true digestibility and net protein utilization values for the Anemonia viridis feed. HDL-cholesterol level was significantly higher (p<0.05) in the groups fed marine species or casein supplemented with olive oil than in the casein group. Total-cholesterol level was higher in the group fed Haliotis tuberculata fed than in the other groups. These results suggest that these marine species are a good protein source, and that they may have positive effects on serum cholesterol level. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

It is vital in aquaculture by bringing beneficial traits into hybrids. People have utilized the heterosis theory in aquaculture for years. However, the molecular basis of heterosis remains elusive. Evident growth and survival heterosis were shown in the hybrid (Dongyou-1) of two Haliotis diversicolor geographic genotypes (Japan and Taiwan). To explore the molecular basis underlying the hybrid abalone's heterosis, we conducted comparative mRNA and miRNA transcriptional analysis in the hybrid and parental genotypes. Differentially expression analysis identified 5,562 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 102 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) between the three genotypes. 1,789 DEGs and 71 DEMs were found to be non-additively expressed in the hybrid. Meanwhile, both the expression level dominance pattern (ELD) and expression level overdominance pattern (ELOD) were found in the DEGs and DEMs, showing the existence of dominance and overdominance models in the hybrid's transcriptome and post-transcriptional regulation. Functional analysis showed the non-additively expressed genes, ELD genes, and ELOD genes were significantly enriched in growth, immunity, and stress response related pathways, while some of the pathways were regulated by the mRNA-miRNA interactions. The expression levels of FGF, C1Q, HC, CAT, SEGPX, and MGST were significantly up-regulated in the hybrid compared to the middle parent value. In conclusion, we identified the existence of non-additivity, dominance, and overdominance models in the transcriptome and miRNAome of the H. diversicolor hybrid; these models facilitate the advantageous parental alleles' integration into the hybrid, contributing to the hybrid's growth and survival heterosis.",10.3389/fmars.2021.667636

However, nothing is known about gene expression of triploid abalone to modulate physiological responses under different environmental stresses. Transcriptomic response to the acute heat-stress and hypoxia were explored in hepatopancreas of diploid and triploid Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) juveniles. A total of 316 million clean reads were de novo assembled into 271,039 contigs, of which a transcriptome with 209,974 non-redundant transcripts was produced. Using generalized fold change (GFOLD) algorithm with a cut-off |GFOLD value| > 4, we identified differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) from diploid and triploid abalone in responses to acute heat-stress and hypoxia treatments, respectively. Comparative analysis of the identified DETs revealed alteration of transcript expression profile, level, and process in triploid abalone compared to their diploid siblings. Thus, our study will provide not only comprehensive insight into understanding of the transcriptional regulation to environmental stresses in triploid abalone but a framework for efficient management of triploid abalone aquaculture.",10.1016/j.margen.2020.100820

As light quality is the most important environmental factor for the photosynthetic organism, and blue light is a main spectrum for photosynthesis and metabolite accumulation in plants, we test blue light for their effects on the G. lemaneiformis. Results showed that the relative growth rate of G. lemaneiformis decreased while the principal economical metabolites, including agar, polysaccharides were accumulated significantly under blue light. To further understand the response mechanism of G. lemaneiformis to blue light, the omics analysis was used, which revealed that blue light redirected metabolic pathways toward the synthesis of diverse primary and secondary metabolic products, divided into four categories, including photosynthesis, antioxidant system, energy metabolism and carbohydrate synthesis. Among them, the genes encoding photosynthetic pigments and phycobiliproteins increased significantly, but the carbon fixation pathway, the ASA-GSH cycle, and TCA cycle were down-regulated, and more carbon flowed into the synthesis pathway of agar and polysaccharides, which were consistent with the changes of physiological parameters. These findings helped us to understand the mechanism of G. lemaneiformis responding to blue light and provide a new perspective for the culture of high-agar content G. lemaneiformis.",10.1016/j.algal.2022.102760

Significant survival heterosis in summer were observed in hybrids between two phylogenetically closely-related oysters, Crassostrea gigas and C. angulata, but an explicit understanding of hetemsis has been lacking. Here, we investigated the survival performance, oxygen consumption rate (OR) and enzyme activity (i.e., SOD, CAT and MDA) in C. gigas (GG), C. angulata (AA) and their hybrids C. gigas female x C. angulata male (GA) and C. angulata female x C. gigas male (AG) under acute heat stress containing five levels: 22, 26, 30, 34 and 38 degrees C. Compared with parental strains, the hybrid strains exhibited higher cumulative survival rate at all temperatures, indicating hetemsis for thermal tolerance. Cox regression analysis showed that hybrid strains challenged with heat shock exhibited lower hazard ratio and longer expected lifetime. Moreover, OR in hybrid strains were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those in parental strains under 34 and 38 degrees C. Arrhenius break-point temperature (ABT) and temperature coefficient (Q/O) revealed that hybrids had broader temperature range of aerobic metabolism and lower sensitivity to rising temperature. In addition, the activities of SOD and CAT of hybrid strains were significantly higher than the parental strains at 34 and 38 degrees C-level treatment after 6 h and at 34 degrees C-level treatment after 3 h, whereas the MDA content were reduced, indicating their stronger antioxidant capacity. Accordingly, the enhanced aerobic capacity and antioxidant ability of hybrids under high temperature may contribute to the improvement of thermal tolerance.

Three different temperatures (12, 16 and 20 degrees C) were chosen to measure the effect of fatty acid accumulation or synthesis compared to the control diet. After 200 days of experimentation, abalone exhibited different growth between each temperature, whereas no differences were observed between diets. However, a higher fatty acid accumulation was observed in muscle tissue at 12 degrees C. The relative amount of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) in the muscle tissue was similar between those individuals fed with the restriction (LC-PUFA free) and full diets. This was clearly observed within the LC-PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), but not with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), suggesting that H. tuberculata is able to synthesize the former FAs from their precursors. This pattern was also observed with arachidonic acid (ARA). In general abalone is able to synthesize and accumulate the necessary fatty acids to sustain growth at a wide range of temperatures and dietary sources, especially at lower temperatures, that could mean that this species is able to cope with a broad range of environmental conditions. However, DHA requirement in the H. tuberculata seems to be much inferior than previously reported, and its biosynthesis is undetectable under the present experimental conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.

E. arborea is the kelp with the largest and most southerly latitudinal distribution on the North Pacific East Coast capable of growing at higher temperatures and in relatively low nutrient conditions. The availability of M. pyrifera is frequently uncertain because it is strongly affected by El Nio events. In order to test E. arborea as a diet for farmed abalone, animals of two different sizes (6 and 2 cm) were fed separately for 12 months with these two seaweed species. The abalones were cultured in cages in an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture farm within San Quintin Bay, Baja California, Mexico. Seaweed was collected for chemical analysis, and every 3 months, animals were measured and weighed to estimate growth. Small size abalone doubled their size on both diets, with an average increase in length of 2.2 mm month(-1). No significant differences were observed between both treatments. Large abalone fed with M. pyrifera had slighter higher growth rates compared to those fed with E. arborea (0.57 and 0.50 % day(-1), respectively). Although M. pyrifera appeared to be a better diet for large animals, the growth rates obtained with E. arborea and the fact that this species could be cultivated in warmer conditions makes this seaweed species a good candidate to feed farmed abalone.",10.1007/s10811-013-0138-9

Consequently, it is becoming increasingly important to characterise the abalone immune system in order to better understand their ability to combat infection. This study reports the identification and characterisation of a perforin-like protein, designated hmMpeg1, which is believed to be involved in the H. midae immune system. hmMpeg1 encodes for a 78 kDa protein that has significant sequence similarity to Mpeg proteins from other abalone species and includes the conserved cytolytic membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain of perforin. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis demonstrated expression of hmMpeg1 mRNA in haemocytes and epipodia samples from H. midae exposed to a heat-killed, Gram-negative bacterial pathogen, Vibrio anguillarum 5676. hmMpeg1 mRNA in haemocytes increased significantly 48 h post-infection (h.p.i) (8.2 fold; P < 0.05), coinciding with a decrease in the total number of circulating haemocytes, and reached a maximum at 96 h.p.i (17.2 fold; P < 0.05). Similarly, a significant increase in the level of hmMpeg1 mRNA occurred at 24 h.p.i in epipodia samples (3.8 fold; P < 0.05), reaching a maximum at 48 h.p.i (4.5 fold; P < 0.05).

In order to investigate this further, the objective of this study was to localise the bacterial probiont Vibrio midae SY9 and one of the extracellular proteases it produces in the digestive tract of the South African abalone Haliotis midae. This was accomplished by inserting a promotorless gfp gene into the chromosome of the bacterium which was incorporated in an artificial, fishmeal-based abalone feed. In situ histological comparison of abalone fed either a basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with V. midae SY9::Tn10.52 using a cocktail of DNA probes to the gfp gene localised the probiont to the crop/stomach and intestinal regions of the H. midae digestive tract. Generally, the ingested probiotic bacterium occurred in association with feed and particulate matter within the crop/stomach and intestinal regions, as well as adhered to the wall of the crop/stomach. Histological immunohistochemical examination using polyclonal anti-VmproA antibodies localised an extracellular protease produced by V. midae SY9 to the H. midae crop/stomach and intestine where it appeared to be associated with feed and/or other particulate matter in the abalone gut. Thus the data suggests that V. midae SY9 colonises and/or adheres to the mucous lining of the abalone gut. Furthermore, the close association observed between the bacterium, its extracellular protease and ingested feed particles supports the theory that V. midae SY9 elevates in situ digestive enzyme levels and thus enhances feed digestion in farmed abalone.",10.1371/journal.pone.0086623

This infection, caused by the rickettsial-like intracellular organism (RIO) Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis, can severely impair the normal development of affected animals, and ultimately, their survival. The most common line of action against the WS has been the use of antibiotics, specifically oxytetracycline (OTC), administered via intramuscular injection and per os via medicated feed. In the present study, we have assessed the effectiveness of OTC baths as therapeutic treatment for the control of the WS agent in H. rufescens. Clinical signs of infection were monitored for 11 months in treated juveniles, in addition to feed consumption rate, growth patterns and gonad development. Abalones were asymptomatic until the end of the experiment, when a small number of non-treated animals exhibited clinical signs of infection. Gonad maturity was not observed. OTC treated animals grew significantly less than their non-treated counterparts, being 4.3% shorter and 13.6% lighter at the end of the experiment. They also displayed negative allometry, i.e. for the same shell length, they were lighter than non-treated groups. Furthermore, the weight of muscle and soft tissues in OTC treated animals was lighter than in the other groups, while no differences were found in shell weight. The feed consumption rate was the same for all groups, thus the observed growth patterns cannot be attributed to a decreased feed intake. One possible explanation is that antibiotic treatment may have impacted gut microflora, thus preventing efficient nutrient digestion and absorption and, indirectly, reducing growth. Prevalence of RLOs causing WS (WS-RLO) and the variant form (RLOv), infected with a bacteriophague and non virulent, were significantly lower in the OTC-treated group than in the other groups. Similar results were observed for the mean intensity of RLOv, while for WS-RLO, the intensity in the OTC-treated group was higher, although not statistically significant, than the rest of the groups. These observations may be the consequence of an increased bacterial sensitivity to OTC effects associated with the phage infection or faster reproduction of WS-RLOs than RLOv after OTC treatment. Our results let us infer that the prophylactic use of OTC in abalone to avoid the negative effects of WS on abalone farms could have an undesired negative effect on the biological control exerted by the phage on the bacteria after OTC treatment.",10.1016/j.jip.2018.02.019

We have identified Se-GPx full length cDNA from disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) designated as AbSe-GPx. It has a characteristic codon at (223)TGA(225) that corresponds to selenocysteine (Sec) amino acid as U-75. The full length cDNA consists of 675 bp, an open reading frame encoding 225 amino acids. Sequence characterization revealed that AbSe-GPx contains a characteristic GPx signature motif 2 ((97)LGFPCNQF(104)), an active site motif ((WNFEKF188)-W-183) and essential residues for the enzymatic function. Additionally, the eukaryotic selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) is conserved in the 3' UTR. The AbSe-GPx amino acid sequence exhibited the highest level of identity (46%) with insect (Ixodes scapularis) GPx, and shares 41% with bivalve (Unio tumidus) Se-GPx. The RT-PCR analysis revealed that AbSe-GPx mRNA was expressed constitutively in gill, mantle, gonad, abductor muscle, digestive tract, and hemocytes in a tissue specific manner. AbSe-GPx mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated in gill and digestive tract tissues after H2O2 injection and Vibrio alginolyticus infection. However, AbSe-GPx expression was not up-regulated after Aroclor 1254 injection. These results indicate that AbSe-GPx mRNA is expressed at a basal level in abalone tissues, which can be up-regulated transcriptionally by H2O2 oxidative stress and Vibrio alginolyticus infection. Therefore, AbSe-GPx may be involved in a protective role against H2O2 oxidative stress and immune defence against bacterial. infection. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.fsi.2008.02.001

However, the existence of different coping styles in response to stress has not been demonstrated in marine gastropods. To evaluate individual differences in shelter fidelity and exploratory levels of abalones in response to stress, the behaviours of juvenile Pacific aba-lones (Haliotis discus hannai) housed in tanks were observed; several behavioural parameters such as forage duration and un-sheltering behaviour were also measured and analysed. To test differences in survival rates between individuals that showed staying (returning to home shelters after foraging) and wandering (not returning to home shelters after foraging) behaviours in response to poor water quality, 90 1-year-old abalones were exposed to hypoxia stress caused by interrupted water flow. To assess the individuals' exploratory be-haviours, 150 1.5-year-old abalones were supplied with excess food inside their shelters, and their movement between the shelters was recorded. Differences in behavioural parameters between the exploratory and non-exploratory individuals in the presence of resident intruders were also tested. Our results showed that (1) staying abalones exhibited higher survival rates than their wandering counterparts under hypoxic stress; (2) the number of shelters visited in one night could be considered as an exploratory activity under conditions of sufficient food availability within the shelters; and (3) in the presence of intruders, both the exploratory and nonexploratory abalones displayed reduced shelter-seeking activity, although the reduction was more pronounced in the exploratory than the nonexploratory abalones.",10.1016/j.applanim.2023.105830

Land-based abalone aquaculture mainly uses commercial feeds (CFs) to promote faster growth, which include FM as a primary protein component. Alternative ingredients, such as insect meal (IM) and grape marc (GM) are potential candidates for FM replacement due to their suitable nutritional profile and sustainable production. This paper reports on a novel nutritional approach for the New Zealand farmed abalone, which replaces FM with IM by 10% and includes a waste by-product (GM) by 30% as a potential prebiotic source. The study was performed in two stages: (a) physico-chemical determination of diets delivered in an alginate matrix (experimental diets) and their stability in seawater compared to CF and (b) evaluation of growth and feed intake for the New Zealand black-foot abalone. There were significant differences between experimental diets and CF in terms of sinking rate, particle weight, and microscopic observations. Water stability of the experimental diets was increased by 50% in 24 and 48 hr compared to CF, producing less solid waste, and potentially reducing cleaning efforts in the farm. The inclusion of IM and GM did not compromise overall animal growth or their feed conversion ratio, however, further evaluation need to be explored in the future research. The findings revealed that the developed encapsulated feeds are a more stable food delivery method for Haliotis iris compared to the CF. Furthermore, both IM and GM can be included in feed formulations as a more sustainable strategy without compromising weight and shell gains in the abalone farming.",10.1155/2023/8887768

Three iron concentrations (0.15, 1.5 and 15mgL-1 of Fe) and a control (no iron added) were used to culture H. rufescens postlarvae while being fed the diatom Navicula inserta over 10days. Results indicate that H. rufescens postlarvae accumulate iron granules in the stomach, digestive gland and mantle, but not in the gills or other tissues. The number and diameter of iron granules in tissues increased with increasing iron concentration in the culturing environment. The iron accumulation is assumed to have been acquired in the digestive system through the iron-enriched diatom feed and in the mantle through subcutaneous iron transfer. The lack of iron granules in the gills suggests that iron is not absorbed through the respiratory system, as is the case for many filter feeding bivalves. Exposure to the highest iron concentration (15mgL-1) resulted in tissue abnormalities where granules accumulated, and may have significantly affected the health of H. rufescens postlarvae. These findings provide valuable information for the regulation of appropriate iron levels within aquaculture settings and highlights the importance of monitoring iron levels within abalone larval culturing environments.",10.1111/j.1365-2109.2011.02969.x

Baffles were installed in the RAS culture tanks to enlarge the attachment area and clean out solid waste materials automatically by hydraulic force only. The experimental disk abalones, of shell length 24.5 +/- 0.5 mm, were cultured at three stocking densities, 700, 1300 and 1910 individuals/m(2) bottom area, in triplicate. The abalones were fed with sea mustard, Undaria pinnatifida, once a week. The abalone feed conversion rates and daily growth rates ranged from 24.5 to 25.9 and 0.32 to 0.36%, respectively. Their daily shell increments and survival rates ranged from 67.7 to 78.6 mu m/day and 87.6-92.2%, respectively. The growth in weight tended to decrease at a culture density of 1300 individuals/m(2) bottom area, while shell increments and survival rates were acceptable at this density. The total power consumption for heating was 1185.4 kW, comprising 30.2% of the total power consumption, while the average water exchange rate was only 2.9% per day. The total ammonia nitrogen stabilized below 0.07 mg/L, after conditioning of the biofilter. The NO2--N, NO3--N and total suspended solid concentrations were also maintained within acceptable ranges for the normal growth of disk abalone.

Measurements of soft body, gonad, and shell growth parameters indicated that white and red fishmeals generally result in better growth. Animals fed blood meal had the lowest survival rates and crude protein contents.

Dietary protein levels significantly affected weight gain but within a protein level, higher lipid levels resulted in reduced growth. No significant differences in survival were observed at the end of the experiment. The fish fed diets containing 18% lipid resulted in reduced feed intake and explained the reduced growth rates observed in fish fed the high lipid diets. However the protein efficiency ratio (PER) was unaffected. The high lipid with low and medium protein content diets significantly reduced growth due to a reduction of feed intake from the unbalanced P:E ratio.

Survival of OTC-injected red and black abalone was significantly higher than that of sham-treated animals (p<0.001 and p=0.036, respectively). Microscopic examination revealed that these animals died from WS and that tissue damage was beyond the ability of the animals to repair. Feeding rates of treated abalone were also significantly higher than for sham-treated control animals (p<0.001 for black abalone and p<0.0001 for red abalone). Oral administration (oxytetracycline medicated feed for 14 consecutive days) also effectively controlled WS in both pilot and production scale applications. The treatment caused significant and persistent long-term reductions in the intensity of bacterial infection as well as in the degree of morphological changes in the digestive gland (p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively).

Adding 3% tryptophan to the diet effectively reduces the negative impacts of seawater washing on sea cucumbers. Similarly, sea cucumbers whose diets were supplemented with fed with 3% dietary tryptophan showed significantly better crawling and feeding behaviors after air exposure, suggesting that tryptophan effectively reduces the negative effects of this stress.

Moreover, nuclear power plants (NPPs) also release excess thermal energy into the environment, contributing to rising seawater temperatures and exacerbating this threat. However, studies on the potential negative impacts of thermal pollution on mariculture are scarce, especially in field environments. Herein, a comparative investigation of hybrid abalone (Haliotis discus hannai female x Haliotis fulgens male) under thermal stress was performed in laboratory and field to evaluate the potential ecological risks of NPP thermal discharge. The survival rate, behavioral changes, antioxidant enzyme activity, and transcriptional profiles of antioxidant-relevant genes were determined in hybrid abalones under thermal stress. Under a natural water temperature of 29 degrees C, an increase of 4 degrees C led to the death of all abalones. In the field study, a temperature increase of 2 degrees C resulted in the partial death of these abalones and a decrease in their adhesion capacity, which did not occur in laboratory. In addition, thermal stress caused considerable changes in the antioxidant enzyme activity in these abalones, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase, and malondialdehyde content. Moreover, transcriptional levels of sod, cat, and heat shock protein 70 genes were substantially induced in laboratory and field studies.

The digestive tract of both starved and fed adult H. laevigata revealed the presence of ciliated, mucus, and secretory cells throughout the digestive tract. The esophagus contained secretory, ciliated, and large mucous cells, with fragmentation spherules also present. The crop extended from the esophagus to the stomach. It was surrounded by thin muscularis and consisted mainly of secretory cells, although some phagocytes were present. The stomach possessed mainly secretory cells, although some ciliated cells, mucous cells, and phagocytes were present. The style sac differed from the stomach, having more ciliated cells. In intestinal regions I to In, the epithelium was shorter than in previous regions. Few cilia were present on the ridges, although many were observed in the gutters. Intestinal regions IV to V contained more mucous cells than intestine III, and more bacteria were observed associated with the fecal string than in other regions. The low incidence of bacterial association with the put epithelium was attributed to the occurrence and number of mucous cells, common throughout the digestive tract. Spherical bodies present in the lumen are believed to be fragmentation spherules involved in waste removal and enzyme release. Starved abalone contained fewer mucous cells in the esophagus, had less pronounced staining reactions in the stomach, contained large amounts of granular inclusions in the style sac, and had fewer phagocytes in the intestines.",

There were no significant toxic effects on Japanese abalone, H. discus hannai cultured in seawater supplemented with (0.75f + 1.37 muM Zn) trace metals d(-1). H. discus hannai showed the highest growth rates when fed on P mollis fertilized with f medium and nitrate (NO3--N) loads ranging from 1176 to 2353 muM d(-1) while red abalone, H. rufescens, grew best when fed on R mollis fertilized with f medium and nitrate loads of 2353-2942 muM d(-1). Both abalone species grew better on P. mollis fertilized with (0.75f + 1.37 muM Zn) d(-1) trace metal solution compared with P mollis without trace metal additions. H. sorenseni, grew well when fed on R mollis, showing higher linear shell growth rates and higher survival rates compared with those of abalone fed on commercially harvested and abundant giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera.

"Zhang, M; Li, L; Liu, Y; Gao, XL",Effects of a Sudden Drop in Salinity on Immune Response Mechanisms of Anadara kagoshimensis,2019,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES,20,18,,,4365,"In this experiment, the effects of a sudden drop of salinity on the immune response mechanisms of the ark shell Anadara kagoshimensis were examined by simulating the sudden drop of salinity that occurs in seawater after a rainstorm. Additionally, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using transcriptome sequencing. When the salinity dropped from 30 parts per thousand (S30) to 14 parts per thousand (S14), the phagocytic activity of blood lymphocytes, the O-2(-) levels produced from respiratory burst, the content of reactive oxygen species, and the activities of lysozymes and acid phosphatases increased significantly, whereas the total count of blood lymphocytes did not increase. Total count of blood lymphocytes in 22 parts per thousand salinity (S22) was significantly higher than that in any other group. The raw data obtained from sequencing were processed with Trimmomatic (Version 0.36). The expression levels of unigenes were calculated using transcripts per million (TPM) based on the effects of sequencing depth, gene length, and sample on reads. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq (Version 1.12.4). Transcriptome sequencing revealed 269 (101 up-regulated, 168 down-regulated), 326 (246 up-regulated, 80 down-regulated), and 185 (132 up-regulated, 53 down-regulated) significant DEGs from comparison of the S14 vs. S22, S22 vs. S30, and S14 vs. S30 groups, respectively. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the DEGs in these salinity comparison groups revealed that the cellular amino acid metabolic process, the regulation of protein processing, the regulation of response to stress, and other terms were significantly enriched. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis showed that nucleotide-binding, oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling pathway (ko04621), apoptosis-multiple species (ko04215), Toll and Imd signaling pathway (ko04624), NF-kappa B signaling pathway (ko04064), apoptosis (ko04210), and focal adhesion (ko04510) were significantly enriched in all salinity comparison groups. qRT-PCR verification of 12 DEGs in the above six pathways was conducted, and the results were consistent with the transcriptome sequencing results in terms of up-regulation and down-regulation, which illustrates that the transcriptome sequencing data are credible. These results were used to preliminarily explore the effects of a sudden drop of salinity on blood physiological and biochemical indexes and immunoregulatory mechanisms of A.kagoshimensis. They also provide a theoretical basis for the selection of bottom areas optimal for release and proliferation of A.kagoshimensis required to restore the declining populations of this species.",10.3390/ijms20184365

A series of on-site experiments was conducted to identify the optimal cultivation conditions for this new model. The effects of different stocking densities and diets on the survival rate and growth rate were examined. Abalones were placed in four stocking densities (20, 30, 40, and 50% coverage of available surface area of the culture cage) in this platform, and a control group with one density was set in the traditional aquaculture system. In addition, the effects of different diets (formulated diet, dried Laminaria japonica, and fresh Gracilaria lemaneiformis) for abalone were also studied. Over 240 days, reductions of the survival rate and growth rate of shell length and body weight were observed with the increase of the stocking density. Although the abalone were fed adequate food, the growth rate was limited by the stocking density. Condition index increased with the culture time but decreased with the increase of the stocking density. The growth rates of the shell length and body weight in the formulated diet group were significantly higher than the other two diets. The results also indicated that the medium and large-sized abalone may be more suitable for the new platform, as the medium and large-sized abalone had a higher growth rate when culturing on the mechanized platform, whereas small abalone grew faster on the traditional model. The results from this study can provide fundamental data supporting the offshore mechanized farming of abalone, which will not only promote the yield and reduce the stress of coastal aquaculture environments, but also will contribute to the transformation and upgrading of the abalone farming industry.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737769

Twelve abalone farms, with an estimated investment of US$12 million, have since been established on the coast of South Africa, with a projected production of 500-800 tons. While Haliotis midae could reach a maximum size of about 200 mm shell length at an age of over 30 years in the wild, farm production is concentrating on an average size of 100 mm after 5 years. Growth rates of 0.08-4.5% body weight day(-1) for abalone of 10-17 mm shell length have been found under stimulated farming conditions on formulated diets. while the corresponding feed conversion ratio (FCR) was 0.9-2.4. Growth rate, FCR and protein efficiency ratio decline at water temperatures above 20 degreesC. Anaesthetics, for example magnesium sulphate, are used to prevent injury during removal from tanks. Prostrate diatoms, such as Cocconeis sublittoralis (Hendey), Amphora proteoides (Hustedt) and Achnanthes brevipes (Agardh) are preferred after the larval stage (5-7 days, depending on temperature) are finished. South Africa abalone growers prefer formulated feeds in pellet form, which is convenience and cost favourable to farm operations and management. Although fish meal has been found to be the most suitable protein source for inclusion in formulated diets, plant proteins such as soy bean meal, cottonseed meal and sunflower meal presented good growth and apparent protein digestibility. The parasite sabellid polychaete, Terebrasabella heterouncinata, recently named by Australian and American researchers, is indigenous to a variety of South African intertidal molluscs and impedes growth by causing irritation beneath the mantle in abalone. Prevention to some degree is possible by high standards of hygiene and husbandry of abalone in the tanks, but new techniques to control large infestations now include ultrasound. In spite or a reputation for toughness, abalone meat frozen immediately after shucking is tender relative to red meat. The success of abalone farming in South Africa has been as a result of a high degree of cooperation between the private sector and government-back-ed research institutions, and it is anticipated that this collaboration will continue.",10.1046/j.1365-2109.2001.00629.x

These abalone were fed with artificial diets (approximately 28% crude protein) and held at 28.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C and 31.0 +/- 1.0 psu salinity. The daily feeding intake of H. asinina decreased with size class, ranging from 0.75% to 0.48% of their dry weight tissue. However, high absorption efficiencies were observed in all 3 size classes, with an average of 81.04%. Further calculations of the obtained energy from the artificial diet for the 3 size classes were 273.6, 666.9, and 1,744.2 J/day, for the 2-, 3-, and 4-cm size classes, respectively. More than 30% of the obtained energy was used for metabolism (ranging from 33.2-42.5%), whereas the energy used for ammonia excretion was low (ranging from 0.8-1.8%). Scope for growth of the abalone varied between size classes (ranging from 37.4-45.8% of the obtained energy). Results from this study suggest the Thai abalone H. asinina fed with this artificial diet and reared in a semiclosed recirculating water system were in optimal culture conditions, because the feed intake resulted in high-energy absorption that allowed a positive enemy balance.",10.2983/035.029.0312

There is little known about the abalone innate immune system against pathogen infection. Clip-domain serine proteases (cSPs) are increasingly recognized to play important roles in host inunune defense in invertebrates. In this study, we cloned a cSP (Hdh-cSP) from abalone (Haliotis discus hannai). We found out that Hdh-cSP was widely expressed in multiple tissues of abalone, with highest level in the immune-like organ, hepatopancreas. V. parahemolyticus infection induced significantly elevated expression of Hdh-cSP in addition to better-characterized innate immune component genes including Rel/NF-kappa B, allograft inflammatory factor (ALInFa), macrophage expressed protein (MEP) and caspase-8. Importantly, the silencing of Hdh-cSP reduced the expression of these genes, suggesting that Hdh-cSP was an upstream regulatory factor in V. parahemolyticus infection. Further analysis showed that apoptosis of hemocytes was inhibited when the transcription of Hdh-cSP was knocked down, suggesting that Hdh-cSP participated in cell apoptosis by regulation of caspase 8 expression in V. parahemolyticus infection.

Ab1 has an effect on the abalone gut microbiota using a culture-dependent method and 16S rRNA gene library analysis. The culturable lactic acid bacteria number in the probiotic sample was 10(5) higher than that in the non-probiotic sample, and we speculate that this significant increase was due to colonization of Ab1 into abalone gut. The result of a culture-dependent method showed that the proportion of Vibrio halioticoli clade, which is known to be a beneficial resident bacterium to abalone, was much higher in the probiotic sample than in the non-probiotic sample. 16S rRNA gene clone sequences revealed that gut microbiota in the probiotic sample was obviously diverse compared to the non-probiotic sample, probably due to improvement of the gut environment by Ab1 colonization. In addition, some beneficial bacteria-like sequences such as V. halioticoli were only found in the probiotic sample. These results suggest that the dietary administration of Ab1 to abalone gut has a great effect on modulation of not only culturable but also unculturable gut microbiota.

Although increasing density from that typically used in farm practices reduced the growth rate by roughly 6%, biomass return increased by 15.5%, over the 9-month period. Increasing feed ration by 20% boosted biomass by significantly increasing abalone growth during the first 3 months by 4%, but was less effective as the animals grew. Growth, mortality and food conversion ratios were optimized in tanks with a low density and a low feed ration, but economic gains were dominated by the increased biomass return from tanks with a higher stocking density.

This worm is endemic to South Africa and the locally cultured abalone, Haliotis midae, are under constant threat of infestation. An understanding of factors that influence abalone growth and sabellid infestation levels under intensive culture conditions is therefore imperative to controlling infestation levels. Abalone were held on an abalone farm at stocking densities of 18%, 23% and 28% of the surface area available to the abalone. They were fed kelp or a pelleted diet, Abfeed(TM). Their growth and infestation levels were monitored for 14 months. Within the range of abalone sizes used for this study kelp-fed abalone grew significantly better than Abfeed(TM)-fed abalone (F-1,F-197 = 7.99; P less than or equal to 0.005), while stocking density had no effect (F-2,F-196 = 1.41; P less than or equal to 0.246) on growth. Abalone that became infested grew at the same rate as those that did not (0.09 less than or equal to P less than or equal to 1). No growth-limiting effect of infestation was detected. There was no effect on total intensity (i.e., the total number of worms per sample of 60 abalone; 0.41 less than or equal to P less than or equal to 1 and 0.17 less than or equal to P less than or equal to 1), or prevalence (i.e., the percentage of infected abalone within a sample; 0.50 less than or equal to P less than or equal to 1 and 0.19 less than or equal to P less than or equal to 1) of infestation by diet and stocking density, respectively.

They were fed the appropriate diet once every day for a 110-day period. Results of this Study clearly showed the necessity of dietary biotin for juvenile abalone as the daily increment in shell length (DISL). visceral pyruvate carboxylase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase activities were significantly influenced by the dietary biotin levels (ANOVA, P < 0.05). However. the survival, specific growth rate (SGR) and carcass proximate compositions were not significantly influenced by dietary biotin at the end of the experimental period. The viscera biotin concentration (VBC) of abalone increased as the biotin supplementation level increased (r = 0.91). Compared to those of other groups, SGR, DISL, VBC and two carboxylase activities of antibiotic group were obviously depressed. It indicated that the intestinal microflora probably contribute to biotin nutrition for juvenile abalone.

Bi-monthly samples were analyzed from S. latissima (including epiphytes, when present) cultivated commercially at an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) site and a reference site in Denmark in 2013-2014. Overall, there was no significant difference for the tested parameters between the two sampling sites; however, seasonal variations were found. The protein concentration varied markedly reaching a maximum of 10.8 % dry weight (DW) in November and a minimum of 1.3 % DW in May 2013. Aspartic and glutamic acids dominated the amino acid profile, accounting for up to 49 % of the total. Greatest seasonal differences in amino acid composition occurred in July, with leucine contributing most (22.7-26.7 %) of the observed differences. A maximal essential amino acid (EAA) score of 68.9 % (based on WHO/FAO/UNU requirements) was achieved in November 2013. The presence of epiphytes in July to November changed neither the amino acid content nor the EAA score. S. latissima is comparable with wheat as a protein ingredient for fish feed and appears to be a suitable protein/amino acid source for human consumption. This study proposes that there may be a mismatch between harvest time and nutritional value. The preferable harvest time for S. latissima is November, due to high protein content and EAA score.

Abalone were fed Gracilaria sp. within a randomized 2 x 3 factorial experiment using 2 stocking densities (T1 (500 pieces/m(2)) and T2 (1,000 pieces/m(2))) and 3 cages (D1, box; D2, mesh cage; D3, prefabricated multitier trays). In addition, 3 stocking densities (T1, 50 pieces/m(2); T2, 100 pieces/m; T3, 200 pieces/m) were evaluated in the prefabricated multitier trays. We found that, in the nursery experiment, 4-mo-old tropical abalone juveniles reared for 90 d showed no significant differences in growth (shell length and body weight) and survival rates among the 3 nursery cages used (Tukey's post hoc test, P > 0.05). Feed conversion ratio, however, was lowest for the high-density treatment T1D3 (7.8 +/- 0.76) and was significantly different from the low density treatment T1D1 (11.32 +/- 1.2) and intermediate density treatment T1D2 (12.39 +/- 1.12; t-test, P > 0.05). Conversely, at higher densities (T2), the same trend applied with abalone reared in multitier basket systems (T2D3), having the highest growth rates and survival rates (29.3 +/- 0.07 mm average shell length (ASL) and 5.16 +/- 0.52 g average body weight (ABW)), followed closely by those reared in mesh cages (T2D2) and boxes (T2D1). Feed conversion ratio was also lowest for T2D3 (7.56 +/- 0.79) and was significantly lower than T2D1 and T2D2. Between treatments, however, abalone reared at lower densities (T1) had significantly higher growth and survival than those reared at higher densities (T2), regardless of the nursery cage used, indicating an inverse relationship between stocking density, growth, and survival. For the grow-out study, tropical abalone reared in multitier trays at low densities (T1) attained the highest growth in shell length and body weight (49.7 +/- 0.11 mm ASL and 29.8 +/- 2.6 g ABW, respectively) at 180 d of culture, which was significantly greater than those reared in the high-density treatment (T3) with significantly smaller shell length and body weight (43.8 +/- 0.18 mm ASL and 21.2 +/- 2.0 g ABW), but not significantly different than the intermediate density treatment. This trend started from day 60 of culture onward when analyzed using Duncan's multiple range test (P > 0.05).

Two independent experiments with Haliotis rufescens postlarvae fed the diatom Navicula incerta were conducted in 10-mL vessels with daily water changes. Two factors were tested following split-plot experimental designs: six diatom densities (from 500-10,000 cells/mm(2)) and two light conditions (constant light at 19-33 mu E/m(2)/s and darkness). Experimental units in darkness were kept inside black plastic bags but subjected to similar to 30 min of ambient light every day for maintenance.

In this study, sulfated polysaccharides from pacific abalone (AGSP) and its desulfated product (D-AGSP) were prepared, and the contribution of sulfate group was analyzed via in vitro and in vivo models. The result showed that sulfate group had no obvious effect on the reaction of AGSP with RAW 264.7 cells, but it affected the growth properties of gut microbes that able to utilize AGSP. The mice experiment showed that D-AGSP reduced weight gain, fat accumulation and lipid metabolism disorder in HFD-fed mice as well as AGSP, and no differences between them were found. Sequencing analysis showed that sulfate group influenced AGSP-induced alterations of the gut microbiota at higher taxonomic levels, some of which had close correlation with the improvement of physiological index. These results implied that sulfate group may partially determine the activities of polysaccharides via gut microbiota-mediated pathway, but the exact mechanisms need further research.

Digestion efficiency (DE), ingestion rate (IR), excretion rate (ER) and digested cell content index (DCCI) of each diatom species were measured. Growth rates largely differed among the dietary treatments from 7days post-settlement. Sea urchins fed on a diatom Cocconeis sublittoralis showed considerably higher growth (7.85-34.67mday(-1)) than those fed on the other diets and high survival rates (100%). DCCI was also highest in C. sublittoralis. These results suggest that the quantity of diatom cell contents digested is an important factor affecting growth and survival of the sea urchins. Growth rates of sea urchins were higher in higher water temperatures, and significant differences in growth rate were observed between 6-9 and 12-15 degrees C. ERs of C. sublittoralis were generally higher at higher temperatures, but DEs did not differ among the temperature treatments.

The ingestion rate was lower than expected for all diets except those of fresh fish, crab paste alone, and crab paste plus prime sardine meal. No significant differences were found in the observed digestibility of the diets, indicating, in general, low digestibility, even for fresh fish. The highest protease values were observed for crab paste plus prime sardine meal in both experiments. The better growth of Enteroctopus. megalocyathus was obtained when these were fed fresh fish, which was associated with the greater consumption observed in this diet, as neither the digestibility nor the enzymatic activities of the hepatopancreas were related to this greater growth.",10.2983/035.029.0412

We examined the behavior of southern California kelp forest predators in response to a concentrated increase in the abundance of abalone during a restoration stocking experiment. We tested three hypotheses: (1) kelp forest predator density will increase following abalone stocking, (2) variations in predator characteristics will create an unequal impact on abalone, and (3) predation intensity will be greatest early in the experiment. Octopus discovered and exploited the influx of prey within the first week following stocking; their densities surged and then returned to pre-stocking levels after 2 months. This was not observed with any other predator. Damage from crustacean, fish, and octopus predation was observed on the recovered abalone shells, but were not correlated with predator densities. A larger percentage of recovered small shells had evidence of crustacean and fish predation, indicating there may be size-specific impacts of predators on abalone. Our results demonstrate that restoration stocking experiments can quantitatively test the predatory community's response to reintroductions, as well as predation risk of newly stocked prey species when exposed to a diverse suite of predators.",10.1007/s10750-018-3514-2

"Stott, AE; Takeuchi, T; Koike, Y",An alternative culture system for the hatchery production of abalone without using livefood,2004,AQUACULTURE,236,1-Apr,341,360,,"Stott's Abalone Postlarval Production System (SAPPS) was developed to replace livefood as the primary means of settling and growing out abalone seed. Culture plates are initially sprayed with microalgal powder/agar gel solution to induce larval settlement. Abalone seed are then raised on an artificial diet/agar gel solution which is sprayed directly onto the culture plates. This study was conducted to test SAPPS on a commercial scale against the diatom biofilm method and two further trials were conducted to investigate the optimum feeding frequency and agar concentration for SAPPS. A total of 100,000 larval Haliotis diversicolor aquatilis were induced to settle onto 90 mucus conditioned commercial rearing plates (5 racks X 18 plates each) in 1500-1 tanks to test two treatments; diatom biofilm method and SAPPS. The trial was conducted over a 6-week period and the temperature averaged 24.2 +/- 1.0 degreesC. Settlement was similar on all plates in the two treatments. The settlement rate per plate was 17,820 8460 for the diatom biofilm and 17,280 6390 for SAPPS. The postlarval growth rate on the SAPPS plates was over 50% higher than the growth rate on the diatom plates. The final length of postlarvae was significantly higher (p < 0.05) on SAPPS plates (3281 +/- 573 mum) than on diatom biofilm plates (2231 +/- 314 mum). Furthermore, the survival of postlarvae was also five times higher on SAPPS (51.7%) compared with diatom biofilm (10.6%). SAPPS plates were heavily colonized by marine bacteria which may have acted as a food source for early postlarvae and assisted in the breakdown of polysaccharides. The whole body protein of juveniles was 17.2% in SAPPS compared to 13.3% in diatom biofilm which may suggest that artificial diet was a more balanced and complete nutrient source than diatom biofilm. Smaller scale trials were conducted over 25 days to determine optimum concentration of agar (2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 mg/ml) and also to determine specific feed frequency (daily, every second day and every third day). There was no significant difference (p>0.05) in survival rate in both trials. However, the growth rate of postlarvae at 2.5 mg/ml agar was significantly lower than the other treatments and the leaching rate (% weight loss of food) was double that of agar concentrations 5.0-10.0 mg/ml. Growth rate was highest (p < 0.05) in the feed frequency experiment for postlarvae fed daily and lowest for those fed every third day. The results suggested that agar concentration was optimal at between 5.0 and 10.0 mg/ml with plates being sprayed daily. SAPPS has potential to be used in industry depending on the development of a mechanized, cost-efficient system for spraying the plates. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In order to establish a chemotaxis index, with special reference to a repellence index of food for black abalone Haliotis discus, a logistic curve y = g/{1 + exp [- r(j - a)]}. where g, r and a are constants, was applied to time-courses of abalone responses to fresh and spoiled algal extracts. The time-courses were respresented by the number of individuals (y(i)) displaying three behaviors (entering. leaving and remaining in a test compartment with algal sample) over time (j = 1 to 10, 2-min intervals). Repellence and attraction specimens were prepared from a homogenate of green layer Ulva pertusa allowed to spoil for 2, 4 and 6 d at 40-degrees-C, and from fresh homogenate, respectively. Of 32 time-courses (estimated according to a method whereby the observed number was weighted by j for each behavior, involving 30 individuals), 32 entered, 19 left and 19 remained time-courses fitted the curve at the 0.10 level, as determined by a chi-square test. A general evaluation of repellence and attraction, determined by observable behavior, agreed well with the difference in a between the dummy (control) and specimen curves, and with the ratio of a in the dummy curve to a in the specimen curve, for logistic curves fitted to the entered time-course. The difference was > 0 and the ratio was > 1 in the repellence index, and < 0 or < 1 respectively in the attraction index.

There were three replicates of each experimental group (stocking density and culture method) and the experiment lasted for 180 days. The results showed that the survival rate, specific growth rate of shell length and body weight, food intake and feed conversion efficiency of the abalones cultured in suspension cages were significantly lower than those in the bottom sown group. For abalones cultured by bottom sowing, there was no significant difference between the specific growth rate of shell length and body weight, feed conversion efficiency, alpha-amylase, cellulase activity and the expression levels of Hdlam on each sampling occasion for the 400 and 600 ind/m(2) treatments. However, these parameters were significantly higher in both the 400 and 600 ind/m(2) treatments compared with the 800 ind/m(2) treatment. When the stocking density was increased to 800 ind/m(2), the food intake and the expression levels of Hdaly, Hdcel, Hdamyl of the abalones cultured in both culture methods were significantly lower than the 400 and 600 ind/m(2) treatments. This indicates that even with sufficient food supply, some abalones were unable to capture food due to the constraints of the culture space and the feeding method used by abalones, resulting in reduced growth. The findings of this research suggest that the growth and food intake of abalones can be promoted and production can be improved at a stocking density of 600 ind/m(2).",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735693

Two selection criteria were investigated, one used family breeding values for liability to disease challenge test infection and the other used a direct selection of the best performing individuals across families for growth rate. Five scales of breeding programme were tested and the model predicted that if growth rate is the only selection criterion, breeding programmes of a scale using 150 families of each species each generation would result in 12-13% genetic improvement in initial generations and have the greatest beneficial economic impact on the Australian abalone industry of the options tested. The model predicts an average discounted benefit-cost ratio of 48:1, total added discounted benefit of AU$4.90 for each kilogram of abalone produced and nominal economic effect on operating income of over AU$16 million per year after 10 years. If disease resistance is the only selective breeding criterion, 100 families of each species would result in the highest benefit-cost ratio of the options tested, although some genetic gain would need to be sacrificed to reduce inbreeding to acceptable levels in this scenario.

Greenlip abalone broodstock were spawned at the beginning of the experiment and again every 16 wks (1131 degrees C days effective accumulative temperature [EAT]) using commercial hatchery practices. The variability of egg diameter within batches spawned from the same female over three consecutive spawning rounds and within diet treatments was determined. Cytoplasm diameter, vitelline layer and jelly coat thickness of unfertilized eggs were also compared between eggs spawned from individual females and between females. In addition. the relationships between broodstock parameters (weight and shell length) and egg diameter were explored. Eggs spawned from females feeding on a red seaweed diet were smaller than eggs from the low ARA treatment. Depending on spawning frequency, broodstock diet can influence the cytoplasm diameter and jelly coat thickness. No relationship between egg diameter and broodstock parameters was found. However, batches spawned from the same female abalone became more variable over time with a shift in size frequency distribution. Results indicate that the variability of egg diameter within a batch changes from female to female and highlights the importance of selecting successful broodstock for conditioning at commercial hatcheries.",10.2983/0730-8000(2006)25[195:IOCDAS]2.0.CO;2

Seasonal oscillations of oceanographic factors additionally influence their physiology, stress responses and survival. Tissue responses to seasonal variations in green ormer (Haliotis tuberculata L.) and Mediterranean scallop (Pecten jacobaeus L.) in the Northern Adriatic have not been reported. Hence, their biochemical and antioxidant defense properties over seasons were studied and the microanatomical structure of their tissue was correlated with function. Histological analysis of gonads revealed two peaks of gonadal maturation and spawning during the spring/summer period and winter season for scallops, and one peak during the fall for ormers. The gonadal maturation of both species was correlated with their seasonal variations of metabolic demands and antioxidant capacity. The lipid vacuoles of tubuloacinar terminations in the digestive gland differed between the two species; in scallop they are several-fold larger in size and number. Low temperatures in winter contributed to a decline in enzymatic antioxidant defense in scallop tissues, having lower superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, and higher concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and total antioxidant status (TAS). In ormers, winter induced lower TAS, TBARS, SOD and GPx concentrations. The significant difference of winter TAS and TBARS levels between ormers and scallops was correlated with variations in their reproductive cycles, as well as in antioxidant defense systems. The most important factor for stress-related parameters for both species in this work was found to be the season-induced temperature change.",10.3390/app11062874

Exposure of abalone to PST supplemented feed for 50 days did not affect behaviour or survival but saw accumulation of up to 1.6 mu g STX-equivalent 100 g(-1) in the abalone foot tissue (muscle, mouth without oesophagus and epipodial fringe), which is similar to 50 times lower than the maximum permissible limit (80 mu g 100 g(-1) tissue) for PSTs in molluscan shellfish. The PST levels in the foot were reduced to 0.48 mu g SIX-equivalent 100 g(-1) after scrubbing and removal of the pigment surrounding the epithelium of the epipodial fringe (confirmed by both HPLC and LC-MS/MS). Thus, scrubbing the epipodial fringe, a common procedure during commercial abalone canning, reduced PST levels by similar to 70%. Only trace levels of PSTs were detected in the viscera (stomach, gut, heart, gonad, gills and mantle) of the abalone. A toxin reduction of approximately 73% was observed in STX-contaminated abalone held in clean water and fed uncontaminated food over 50 days. The low level of PST uptake when abalone were exposed to high numbers of A. minutum cells over a prolonged period may indicate a low risk of PSP poisoning to humans from the consumption of H. laevigata that has been exposed to a bloom of potentially toxic A. minutum in Australia. Further research is required to establish if non-dietary accumulation can result in significant levels of PSTs in abalone. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We quantified the effect of flow rate (87-246 L min-1) on the performance of 2-year-old hybrid abalone (Haliotis laevigata and Haliotis rubra) held at two stocking densities (11400 and 7600 tank-1). A 50% higher density yielded a 27% increase in biomass gain, despite a 10% growth reduction and 3% higher mortality. At the lower density, there was an optimal flow rate of approximately 200 L-1, at which biomass gain was 474 kg and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was 1.31. At the higher density, biomass gain (max = 658 kg) and FCR (min = 1.41) improved linearly with increasing flow, suggesting that an optimal flow rate exists at 246 L-1 or beyond those tested. Increased oxygen availability with increasing flow is thought to have enhanced abalone performance, although flows greater than 200 L min-1 may have reduced performance at low density due to feed washout and nutrient leaching.

As a result, stripping the spats (35 mm) off by anaesthetization and switching the diet from live diatoms to artificial powdered diet in combination has to be performed in most of the abalone farms. This manipulation normally leads to more than 50% mortality. Here we report the direct use of the unicellular green alga Platymonas helgolandica Kylin var. tsingtaoensis as a potential alga to be used to settle the veliger larvae of the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai and to feed the postlarvae. Settlement rate of 2-day-old veliger larvae in mono culture of P helgolandica could be as high as 92% ( +/- 4.2%) on day 10 in small scale trials, higher than that in the selected benthic diatom strain (53.6% +/- 12.7%) when settled in the water in which bacteria propagation was controlled by treatment of 2 ppm of benzylpenicillinum calcium and streptomycin sulfate. Postlarvae fed solely on P. helgolandica or the selected benthic diatom Navicula-2005-A grew at rates of 40.1 ( +/- 1.9) and 45.8 (+/- 13.4) mu m day(-1), respectively, when raised at 22 degrees C until day 50 postfertilization. P. helgolandica was shown to have distinct diurnal settling rhythm characterized with a peak of settled cells in the middle of the night for cell division and a peak of free-swimming cells in the middle of the day. High density of attached P. helgolandica cells on the inner surface of the culture facility in the night fits the nocturnal feeding behavior of the abalone spats. Judged by the promising larvae settling rate, growth and survival rates of the postlarvae fed with this alga, the free-swimming micro-green alga P. helgolandica constitutes a potential species for settling the veliger larvae and for supporting the growth of postlarvae as well.

Its fishery, which in the past decades has ranged between 828 (2001) and 24,828 (1980) metric tons per year [SERNAP, 2005. Servicio Nacional de Pesca: Anuarios estadisticos. (http://www.sernap.cl/paginas/publicaciones/anuarios/index_anuario.php)], is based exclusively on the exploitation of wild stocks. So far, there has been limited interest in tackling the biological and technical feasibility of cultivation of C concholepas. Hence, the knowledge about its early ontogenetic stages (i.e., larval, early postmetamorphic and small juvenile) cultivation is still deficient. In this study we investigated, under laboratory and field conditions, C. concholepas survivorship, growth rates, feeding rates and the onset of sexual reproduction. Competent loco's larvae were collected in the field and metamorphosed in the laboratory to assess growth rates and survivorship during the first six months of postmetamorphic life. Moreover, using small juvenile C. concholepas of ca. 20 mm of peristomal length, collected in the field, we monitored for the body size and live weight traits in laboratory and field rearing conditions. The feeding of the early postmetamorphics and small juveniles was exclusively based in mono diets of the mussel Semimytilus algosus. The rearing of small juveniles was conducted in two consecutive phases, using two specially designed rearing apparatus. The biochemical content of our laboratory cultivated specimens was compared with values obtained from specimens collected in natural habitats. Their rapid growth and good survivorship makes this species suitable for rearing of cocktail-size specimens (50-60 mm) in less than a year. According to the growing rates reported in this study the legal commercial size of C. concholepas: 100 mm of PL would be reached under field and laboratory conditions in 1.65 and 2.64 years respectively. Moreover, it was found that in our rearing conditions C. concholepas reach sexual maturity in less than a year of benthic life. In summary, considering the findings about C. concholepas high growth rates, and low mortalities, we suggest that our rearing methodologies may be scaled up and implemented for the commercial aquaculture of this unique and valuable muricid.

One thousand two hundred sixty juvenile abalone were randomly distributed into 18 70-L plastic rectangular containers. Six experimental diets were prepared in triplicate. The TBM0 diet included 28% fish meal and 13% soybean meal as the protein source. Twenty-five, 50, 75, and 100% of the fish meal were substituted with TBM. Finally, salted sea tangle was prepared. The essential amino acids, such as isoleucine, lysine, and valine, tended to decrease with the dietary substitution of TBM for fish meal in the experimental diets. The weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone that were fed the TBM25 diet were higher than those of abalone that were fed the other diets. The crude protein content of the soft body of the abalone linearly decreased with the dietary substitution of TBM for fish meal. In conclusion, as much as 75% of the fish meal in the diet of abalone can be replaced with TBM without retardation in weight gain and SGR of the abalone when 28% fish meal was included.",10.1111/jwas.12255

Animals were held in cages deployed in a flowtray with recirculating seawater maintained at 18 +/- 2 degrees C, and fed ad libitum on the red alga Palmaria palmata (L.) Kuntze. In the grading experiment juvenile abalone were divided into four populations consisting of small (mean +/- s.e; initial shell length = 15.3 +/- 0.15 mm; n = 35), medium (initial shell length = 19.6+/-0.16 mm; n = 35), large (initial shell length = 23.8 +/- 0.17 mm; n = 35) and an ungraded control group (16.8 +/- 0.41 mm; n = 35). Rearing was carried out over a period of 226 days, after which it could be concluded that an advantage in overall growth performance had been gained by grading the animals. There was evidence that growth of small abalone improved in the absence of larger conspecifics. In the stocking density experiment with two size grades and three stocking densities, a decreasing exponential relationship was found between growth (body weight and shell length) and stocking density, with a substantial amount of growth occurring at all densities. Final total biomass for both grades of abalone increased with density. For the smaller grade biomass gain increased as density increased. However, for the larger grade biomass gain declined at higher density. Overall mean survival (+/- s.e) was 98.3 +/- 0.4% and was not influenced by density. It is suggested that the choice of stocking density is essentially a trade-off between maximum growth, optimal biomass gain, and economic considerations which may dictate densities that would result in a net reduction in overall production costs.",10.1016/0044-8486(95)00066-6

A semiclosed recirculating land-based system was used with stocking densities of 368, 735, and 1,100 individuals/m(2). Each stocking density had 3 replicates. An artificial diet, modified from a shrimp commercial diet, was used throughout this experiment. In July 2008, initial sizes of abalone (mean shell length (SL) +/- SE) were not statistically different, with values of 1.28 +/- 0.0062, 1.28 +/- 0.0131, and 1.30 +/- 0.0339 cm for 368, 735, and 1,100 individuals/m(2), respectively (P>0.05). After 8 mo, SLs were significantly different, with values of 3.63 +/- 0.092, 3.25 +/- 0.1173, and 3.05 +/- 0.0985 cm for the 3 stocking densities. As the stocking density increased, mean specific growth rates, measured by the percent increase in SL during the 8-mo period, decreased, with values (mean +/- SD) of 1.97 +/- 0.0495, 1.66 +/- 0.1595, and 1.53 +/- 0.0544. The mean specific growth rate of the density 368 individuals/m(2) was significantly different from 735 individuals/m(2) and 1,100 individuals/m(2). The variations of specific growth rate, calculated in term of the coefficient of variation (mean SD) were increased with increasing stocking densities: 20.16 +/- 0.251, 22.17 +/- 3.146, and 23.66 +/- 0.886. The difference was significant only between the 368 individuals/m(2) and the 1,100 individuals/m(2). The best-fit linear equations between the natural logarithm of specific growth rate and initial size of abalone for 3 stocking densities were estimated. These equations demonstrated that specific growth rates of the larger size abalone decreased at higher rates than that of the smaller size as the stocking density increased. This demonstrated a nonrandom effect of stocking density on abalone size. This also implied that grading of large abalone should be done regularly. Allometric equations between shell width (SW) and SL as well as between total weight (TW) and SL were calculated: SW = 0.6531 SL0.777 (r(2) = 0.721) and TW = 0.3276 SL2.720 (r(2) = 0.823), respectively.

No mass mortality occurred in any groups, but abalone in coculture groups showed significantly better growth performance and higher survival, suggesting that coculture of juvenile abalone with sea cucumber, a deposit-feeding species, can reduce the levels of inorganic nitrogen in the water and consequently enhance growth.

Additionally, biochemical and molecular responses were evaluated in H. discus hannai exposed to various temperature gradients. The survival rate was reduced in abalones exposed to relative high temperatures (more than 26 degrees C). Increased temperature stress induced a higher falling rate and abnormal foot structure. Furthermore, increased antioxidant enzyme activities were observed in abalones exposed to relative high temperatures (26 and 28 degrees C). The activities of superoxide dismutase were induced in a time-dependent manner after high temperature stress.

Laboratory experiments were conducted for 8 or 9 wk with turban snail of 3 size groups, early juveniles with 1.26-mm and 2.89-mm shell diameters and juveniles with an 8.1-mm shell height. The 2 diameter size groups of early juveniles grew well (22.3 +/- 5.5 mu m/day and 16.4 +/- 4.2 mu m/day, respectively; mean +/- SD) on ACA with natural diatom densities, whereas the growth rates were significantly lower on ACA with reduced diatom densities in both size groups (6.7 +/- 0.8 mu m/day and 4.0 +/- 2.2 mu m/day, respectively). A significant difference in growth rate was also found between early juveniles of 1.26 mm on Agar with natural and reduced diatom densities. In contrast, no significant difference was detected in juveniles of 2.89 mm on Agar with natural and reduced diatom densities. Although turban snail juveniles of 8.1 mm reared on Agar with natural diatom densities had very high growth rates (106.1 +/- 18.3 mu m/day), the mean growth rate of juveniles on ACA with natural diatom densities was relatively low (10.9 +/- 5.8 mu m/day). The results of the 3 feeding experiments indicate that diatoms are an important food source for juvenile T. commis from 1.25 mm to approximately 4.0 mm, and that the importance of fronds of G. elegans as a food source increases as juveniles increase in size. In addition, the species composition and density of diatoms on ACA fronds collected from a nursery habitat of the turban snail were observed continuously for approximately 2 y.

The Puget Sound Restoration Fund, in collaboration with state and federal agencies, has been outplanting juvenile pinto abalone at sites in the San Juan Archipelago, and some sites are much more successful than others despite similar physical characteristics. The sites, however, likely differ in oceanic parameters, such as temperature, salinity, and pH, which are in turn changing as the climate of the Earth is changing. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of temperature fluctuation and pCO(2) levels on the survival, growth, and oxygen consumption of juvenile pinto abalone. In a fully crossed experiment, juvenile pinto abalone were held at either currently ambient (400 ppm) or elevated (1,200 ppm) pCO(2) and at constant (10 degrees C) or fluctuating (10 -> 14 -> 10 degrees C) temperature. Survival was monitored weekly and growth was measured after 4 wk. In a second experiment, abalone were held in the same crossed pCO(2) and temperature treatments, and oxygen consumption was measured. High pCO(2) and fluctuating temperature both significantly decreased abalone survival. Abalone growth was not affected by pCO(2) level (temperature could not be analyzed due to very poor survival in the fluctuating temperature treatments). In addition, there was an interaction between fluctuating temperature and pCO(2) level on abalone oxygen consumption. Abalone in the constant temperature treatment had higher oxygen consumption when exposed to elevated pCO(2); however, this pattern was not observed in the fluctuating temperature treatment. The results of this experiment indicate that outplant sites with minimal temperature fluctuation and lower pCO(2) levels could lead to improvements in outplanting success of juvenile pinto abalone.",10.2983/035.043.0207

The results showed that the survival rate of triploids in the 26 degrees C group was significantly higher than that of diploids (P < 0.05), while the survival rate of triploids in the other two groups was similar to that of diploids (P > 0.05). Except for the shell width of the 22 degrees C group and the shell length of the 26 degrees C group, triploid Pacific abalone exhibited significantly superior growth traits compared to diploids at all temperatures (P < 0.05). The most notable improvement was observed in the foot muscle weight trait, where there were triploid advantage rates of 81.44% (18 degrees C), 76.21% (22 degrees C), and 54.96% (26 degrees C). The specific growth rate and the ratio of shell length and body weight indicated that triploids grew the fastest in the 22 degrees C group. Furthermore, the thermal resistance of diploids and triploids was evaluated through the Arrhenius break temperature (ABT) of cardiac performance. The results demonstrated that the ABT of triploids was significantly higher than that of diploids (P < 0.05, ABT(2N) = 30.81 +/- 0.43 degrees C, ABT(3N) = 31.38 +/- 0.72 degrees C).

In this study, GST kappa (GST kappa) from the disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus; AbGST kappa) was characterized at both the transcriptional and functional levels to determine its potential capacity to perform as a detoxification agent under conditions of different stress. The predicted AbGST kappa protein consists of 227 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 25.6 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 7.78. In silico analysis reveals that AbGST kappa is a disulfide bond formation protein A (DsbA), consisting of a thioredoxin domain, GSH binding sites (G-sites), and a catalytic residue. In contrast, no hydrophobic ligand binding site (H-site), or signal peptides, were detected. AbGST kappa showed the highest sequence identity with the orthologue from pufferfish (Takifugu obscurus) (60.0%). In a phylogenetic tree, AbGST kappa clustered closely together with other fish GST kappa s, and was evolutionarily distanced from other cytosolic GSTs. The predicted three-dimensional structure clearly demonstrates that the dimer adopts a butterfly-like shape. A tissue distribution analysis revealed that GST kappa was highly expressed in the digestive tract, suggesting it has detoxification ability. Depending on the tissue and time, AbGST kappa showed different expression patterns, and levels of expression, following challenge of the abalone with immune stimulants. Enzyme kinetics of the purified recombinant proteins demonstrated its conjugating ability using 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and glutathione (GSH) as substrates, and suggested it has a low affinity for both substrates. The optimum temperature and pH for the rAbGST kappa GSH: CDNB conjugating activity were found to be 35 degrees C and pH 8, respectively indicating that the abalone is well adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions. Cibacron blue (100 mu M) was capable of completely inhibiting rAbGST kappa (100%) with an IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of 0.05 mu M. A disk diffusion assay revealed that rAbGST kappa could significantly protect cells from H2O2 , CdCl2, and ZnCl2. Altogether, this current study suggests that AbGST kappa is involved in detoxification and immunological host defense mechanisms and allows abalones to overcome stresses in order for them to have an increased chance of survival.",10.1016/j.fsi.2018.03.058

Germlings of the 2 green macroalgae of different age, enrichment level, and in combination were tested as settlement cues, and CCA was tested as a positive control. Larval settlement was the highest on CCA (61%) tailed by a 45-day-old mix of U. lens and U. rigida (52%) and 45-day-old U. rigida (46%). Settlement was the lowest (about 3%) on a mix of 4-day-old U. lens and U. rigida and 45-day-old enriched or unenriched U. lens. In all treatments, postlarvae were fed for 4 wk with a mix of diatoms (Amphora sp., Proschkinia sp., Nitzschia sp., and Navicula incerta); postlarval growth was the best on the 45-day-old mix of U. lens and U. rigida. This substrate was also the best of the green macroalgae germlings substrates tested for settlement induction and provided good survival rates. The substrate protein content correlated negatively with larval settlement and survival. The algal cues were differentiated by their fatty acid composition. Fatty acids such as 18:1n-7, 18:2n-6, 16:4n-3, arachidonic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid were suggested to affect settlement and survival. The fatty acids correlated with settlement were different from the ones associated with survival rates, except eicosapentaenoic acid, which correlated with both. The results of this study show the high value of U. rigida for H. tuberculata postlarvae, and the influence of substrate age on the settlement success.",10.2983/035.031.0430

The role of plasticity and acclimation, within and across generations, may be essential given the pace of change. We investigated plasticity across generations and life stages in response to ocean acidification (OA), which poses a growing threat to both wild populations and the sustainable aquaculture of shellfish. Most studies of OA on shellfish focus on acute effects, and less is known regarding the longer term carryover effects that may manifest within or across generations. We assessed these longer term effects in red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) using a multi-generational split-brood experiment. We spawned adults raised in ambient conditions to create offspring that we then exposed to high pCO(2) (1180 mu atm; simulating OA) or low pCO(2) (450 mu atm; control or ambient conditions) during the first 3 months of life. We then allowed these animals to reach maturity in ambient common garden conditions for 4 years before returning the adults into high or low pCO(2) treatments for 11 months and measuring growth and reproductive potential. Early-life exposure to OA in the F1 generation decreased adult growth rate even after 5 years especially when abalone were re-exposed to OA as adults. Adult but not early-life exposure to OA negatively impacted fecundity. We then exposed the F2 offspring to high or low pCO(2) treatments for the first 3 months of life in a fully factorial, split-brood design. We found negative transgenerational effects of parental OA exposure on survival and growth of F2 offspring, in addition to significant direct effects of OA on F2 survival. These results show that the negative impacts of OA can last within and across generations, but that buffering against OA conditions at critical life-history windows can mitigate these effects.",10.1111/gcb.17048
"Durand, F",Insects and food security in South Africa in the light of climate change,2022,TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE,62,4,623,646,,"The Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating socio-economic effect on the country, including the death of more than 102 000 people, many of whom were the breadwinners of their families. This could not have happened at a worse time, since the economy of the country was in a recession even before the pandemic. The situation is exacerbated by the highest level of unemployment in the world, widespread nepotism and corruption, the plundering of state coffers and the favouring of the business interests of BRICS partners by government officials over those of South Africans. The government's commitment to prioritising their BRICS partners' business interests over those of the South African people contributes to food insecurity in South Africa. This includes the export of coal from mines in Mpumalanga to China and India, while nothing is done to rehabilitate the region, which was once known for its agriculture. The government handed over to the Chinese company SAEMB the Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone, where four opencast mines, a 3 300 MW power station and an iron smelting plant will be developed. This development, however, requires the government to build a dam that will harvest 60% of the annual runoff of the Limpopo River, which in turn will have a devastating effect on farmers and communities downriver in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique who irrigate their crops with water from the Limpopo River. The same kowtowing of the South African government to its BRICS partners can be seen in the reluctance with which the government responds to the plundering of our marine resources by Chinese fishing boats and abalone smugglers. The unfair competition imposed on local chicken farmers by distributers of dumped chicken, mainly from Brazil, with the approval of government, caused the closure of several South African chicken farms and the resulting loss of tens of thousands of jobs along the supply chain. The reluctance of the government to take sides in the Russia-Ukraine war is partly linked to the fact that South Africa imports fertilizer and wheat from Russia. South Africa, a water-scarce country, is more vulnerable than many other countries to the effects of global climate change. The abnormal rain pattern, that is characterised by severe droughts in certain regions and heavy rainstorms and floods in others, has a devastating impact on the already economically struggling South African community. Abroad, attempts are made to ensure that mean temperatures do not exceed the pre-industrial level mark by more than 1,5 degrees C. South Africa, however, heats up twice as fast as many other countries, and has already exceeded the pre-industrial era level by more than 2 degrees C; it will continue to get warmer and drier, causing most of the country to become desertified by 2050. A third of South African rivers do not reach the sea anymore because of over abstraction of water from rivers; similarly, there is extensive abstraction of groundwater. Together farming and forestry account for 70% of water use in South Africa. This over abstraction of water, worsened by the heat and aridification resulting from climate change, led to the degradation of most wetland and estuarine ecosystems and the drying and burning of irreplaceable peatlands. These political, socioeconomic and environmental calamities create the worst possible scenario for food security in South Africa. Already one in four people in Africa suffers from food insecurity and this number will rapidly rise in the wake of global climate change, which will result in the loss of two thirds of arable land by 2025. South Africa is nearing socioeconomic collapse. This, in conjunction with continuing droughts, storms and rising temperatures associated with global climate change, will lead to food insecurity, starvation and anarchy. The effect of global climate change will make it progressively more difficult to produce enough food for the South African population. It is imperative that South Africans consider alternative methods of food production, including water use. Entomophagy is widely practiced throughout the world, but is especially prevalent in South America, the Far East and Africa, where approximately 2 billion people use 1 900 species of insects as food. The nutritional value of insects is unsurpassed and, in some respects, even more nutritious than meat. The larvae of the black soldier fly (BSF) Hermetia illucens are a source of high-quality proteins and unsaturated fats that are used worldwide as animal feed. Insects are a source of minerals such as iron, calcium, copper, zinc and magnesium and high levels of vitamin A, B 2 and C. The ecological and socioeconomic benefits of using BSF larvae instead of grain as feed for fish, chickens and pigs are enormous. BSF larvae can be bred almost for free by feeding it a wide variety of organic waste, including rotten vegetables and fruit, manure and even carcases that would have ended up in rubbish dumps and would have contributed to the methane and carbon dioxide pollution emanating from such dumps. The water use of BSF is negligible, because the water in the organic waste that would have been discarded in waste dumps is sufficient to sustain them. BSF affords the subsistence and small-scale farmer the opportunity to raise chickens at a lower input cost than ever before. The conversion of feed to food in insects is far greater than that of chickens, pigs or cattle. In the case of the house cricket (Acheta domestica) the conversion rate of feed to food is twice as effective as that of chickens, four times as effective as pigs and twelve times greater than that of cattle. Compared to conventional farming, this implies that with insects far more exceptionally nutritious food can be produced in a smaller area, with little water and no poison or fertilizer whatsoever, while waste and the associated methane gas are removed from the environment at the same time. A few South African companies have already seen the potential of insects as food and feed. Even though insect farming is still in its infancy, it is already generating jobs and new socioeconomic opportunities in South Africa. Insect farming, especially BSF farming, will in the near future probably grow in popularity all over the world as an affordable, healthy, ecologically sustainable alternative food source that will, directly or indirectly, be consumed by humans. BSF afford the environmentally conscious homesteader who wants to produce livestock such as chickens, fish, or pigs in a sustainable manner an unsurpassed environmentally friendly alternative. BSF will also give the desperate, impoverished and starving population of the future an alternative free source of feed that will offer them economic prospects and food security.",10.17159/2224-7912/2022/v62n4a1

The effect of dehulled soybean meal (DSM), soy protein concentrate (SPC) and corn gluten meal (CGM) on abalone H. discus hannai were evaluated through 16S rRNA, transcriptomics and metabolomics in the present study. The core gut microbiota of abalone varied among the different diet groups (DSM, SPC and GCM): Mycoplasma (57.51 %, 64.39 %, 70.23 %). Multi-omics integrative analysis indicated that abalone fed with the SPC diet effectively activated nutrients metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis via microbiota-gut-digestive gland axis. Abalone fed with the SPC diet had the lowest chewiness, gumminess and hardness of muscle. Moreover, abalone fed with the DSM diet significantly increased the abundance of Bacteroidetes, which significantly impacted the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis metabolism through the microbiota-gut-digestive gland axis. In contrast, the CGM diet led to a significant changes in the gut microbiota of abalone, characterized by an increased abundance of Marinifilaceae and Bacteroides, while the abundance of Proteobacteria decreased. This microbial change was associated with reduced activity of the gut digestive enzyme pectinase, ultimately affecting the efficiency of nutrient absorption. In addition, there was a correlation between gut microbial abundance, gut enzyme activities and cell-free hemolymph metabolite content, which might be the reason for the difference in utilization of different plant protein sources by abalone. These results light the functional interaction between the gut milieu and the digestive gland axis under the efficacy of different protein sources.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2025.742501

Very few studies have focused on the individual consistency of foraging behaviour in marine herbivores. Because marine ectotherms are strongly influenced by their environment and because a mixed diet is appropriate for herbivores, we hypothesized thatHaliotis tuberculata, a large marine gastropod, would not exhibit significant individual consistency in foraging activity and would display generalist food choices. To test these hypotheses, the behaviour of 120 abalone was studied using a choice test of eight macroalgal species over 3 weeks, with video recording 24 hr a day. In addition, primary components, secondary metabolites and toughness of the eight algae were measured. At the population level, food choice was mainly related to the protein composition and the toughness of the macroalgae. We found thatH. tuberculatais a generalist species feeding on a variety of algae (IS = 0.64), even if 21% of the individuals can be considered to be specialists. However, in contrast to our hypothesis, highly consistent between-individual variation was observed in foraging activity (ICC = 0.81 for time spent feeding and ICC = 0.74 for number of feeding visits per day). The high individual consistency of foraging activity has some ecological and evolutionary implications currently not understood for this marine herbivore.",10.1111/eth.13020

Superior hybrids are widely utilized in aquaculture with large benefits. As a typical example, interspecific hybrid Lvpan abalone (Haliotis discus hannai female x H. fulgens male) also has excellent growth performance, as well as advantaged thermal tolerance. Nevertheless, the mechanisms responsible for this growth heterosis in Lvpan hybrid abalone have remained elusive. In this study, a twomonth thermostatic acclimation experiment was conducted for Lvpan abalone and its parental species at three temperatures (14, 18, and 24 C-degrees). The results showed that the interspecific hybrid 'Lvpan' abalone exhibited significant growth heterosis when compared to its parental species, especially at high temperatures. Transcriptome dynamics in the foot muscles of abalones also unveiled that most genes expression patterns represented to be maternal-biased, which are involved in growth-related process. It indicated that maternal effects on gene expression in hybrid abalones play can play an important role in growth heterosis. Moreover, we observed that most genes expressed non-additively in the hybrid abalone are involved in the regulation of growth and cell differentiation during development, which play pivotal roles in the formation of growth heterosis. Consequently, we have provided new insights into abalone interspecific heterosis, emphasizing the pivotal role that non-additive gene expression plays in generating heterosis through cross-breeding.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.741657

High water temperature (>24 C-degrees) is widely accepted as a key contributor to elevated summer mortality. High crude protein levels in modern abalone diets may interact with elevated water temperature to produce detrimental effects on abalone physiological processes but have received scant attention. This study measured the energy used in the digestion, absorption, and assimilation (i.e., specific dynamic action (SDA)) of hybrid abalone (Haliotis laevigata x H. rubra) after four months of acclimation to three protein levels (32, 38 and 44%) at three culture temperatures (12, 17 and 22 C-degrees). Hybrid abalone exhibited significant stepwise increases in meal size as temperature increased from 12 through to 22 C-degrees, contributing to significantly different SDA between the temperature treatments. Resting (standard) aerobic metabolic rate and peak metabolism (peak MO2 ) during SDA both increased with temperature, while SDA duration was lowest at 17 C-degrees. No effect of dietary protein was observed within the temperature treatments for the SDA metrics. Abalone held at 12 C-degrees exhibited significantly higher rates of gonad maturation, particularly among females. When 22 C-degrees-acclimated abalone were exposed to a simulated summer heatwave up to 26(degrees)C, they exhibited similar mortality and metabolic responses across protein treatment groups and there was a trend of steadily decreasing MO2 with sustained 26 C-degrees water temperature, probably due to fasting.

With its widespread culture, high temperature has become a key abiotic factor for the high mortality of Pacific abalone in summer, particularly in the south of China. To understand the molecular regulatory mechanisms of thermal stress response in Pacific abalone for further analyzing its heat adaptive capacity, we subjected Pacific abalone to acute heat stress at 28 degrees C for 6, 24, and 48 hr, respectively. A total of 2,213, 2,337, and 1,420 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in Pacific abalone after 6, 24, and 48 hr of thermal stress, respectively, as compared with the control group without heat stimulation. These DEGs were significantly enriched in protein folding and chaperone-mediated protein folding process, antigen processing and presentation, and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathways. The expression of numerous molecular chaperones was significantly upregulated after thermal stress. Maintaining cellular homeostasis through the upregulated expression of molecular chaperones associated with endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways might be central to the defense of Pacific abalone against thermal stress. In addition, the expression of Toll-like receptor 6 (TLR6) and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) genes of the TLR signaling pathway was also induced. Therefore, the Pacific abalone might activate the immune defense system to resist the invasion of pathogenic bacteria by upregulating immune-related genes after thermal challenges.

Recent studies have suggested that the immune functions of bivalves could be affected by harmful algae and/or by their toxins. Herein, hemocytes are the main effector cells of the immune cellular response. In this study, we evaluated the response of hemocytes from the mussel Mytilus chilensis to STX exposure in a primary culture. Cell cultures were characterized according to size and complexity, while reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was evaluated using a dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay. Finally, phagocytic activity was measured using both flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy assays. Additionally, gene transcription of candidate genes was evaluated by qPCR assays. The results evidenced that exposures to different concentrations of STX (1-100 nM) for 24 h did not affect cell viability, as determined by an MTT assay. However, when hemocytes were exposed for 4 or 16 h to STX (1-100 nM), there was a modulation of phagocytic activity and ROS production. Moreover, hemocytes exposed to 100 nM of STX for 4 or 16 h showed a significant increase in transcript levels of genes encoding for antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT), mitochondrial enzymes (COI, COIII, CYTB, ATP6, ND1) and ion channels (K+, Ca2+). Meanwhile, C-type lectin and toll-like receptor genes revealed a bi-phase transcriptional response after 16 and 24-48 h of exposure to STX.

The TPx signature motif 1 (FYPLDFFFVCPTEI) and motif 2 (GEVCPA) were conserved in both AbTPx1 and AbTPx2 amino acid sequences. Purified recombinant abalone TPx fusion proteins catalyzed the reduction of H2O2 and butyl hydroperoxide in peroxidase assays. Furthermore, both AbTPx fusion proteins were shown to protect super-coiled DNA from damage by metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) in vitro. Escherichia coli cells transformed with AbTPx1 and AbTPx2 coding sequences in pMAL-c2x showed resistance to H2O2 at 0.8 mM concentration by in vivo H2O2 tolerance assay. AbTPx1 and AbTPx2 mRNA were constitutively expressed in gill, mantle, abductor muscle and digestive tract in a tissue specific manner. Additionally, both TPxs mRNA were up-regulated in gill and digestive tract tissues against H2O2 at 3 h post injection. The results indicate that AbTPx1 and AbTPx2 gene expressions are induced by oxidative stress and their respective proteins function in the detoxification of different ROS molecules to maintain efficient antioxidant defense in disk abalone.

The food with the greatest mean daily consumption in wet weight was the sea star with 24.03 +/- 2.69 g, followed by fish (11.36 +/- 3.74 g), shrimp (9.52 +/- 1.21 g) and squid (736 +/- 2.16 g). Absorption rate was higher when squid was consumed (97.1 +/- 3.7%, dry weight) followed by shrimp (93.5 +/- 4%), fish (87.8 +/- 8.6%) and sea star (45 +/- 15.3%). Although squid absorption was higher, due to high consumption rates against sea star and fish, energy input did not differ significantly. Tritons absorbed a large proportion of ash only when consuming sea star. Results indicate that C seguenzae can adapt well in captivity conditions by efficiently digesting alternative foods. Furthermore, a low metabolism is indicated by its low transit that needs 6 to 8 days to digest food consumed from a single feeding. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"Mouton, A; Gummow, B","The occurrence of gut associated parasites in the South African abalone, Haliotis midae, in Western Cape aquaculture facilities",2011,AQUACULTURE,313,1-Apr,1,6,,"Abalone have been cultured in South Africa for seventeen years. The growing industry has led to increased intensification. Farms are concentrated in certain areas, notably Hermanus on the South coast, and may be close to wild abalone populations and processing facilities. These factors contribute to increased risk of disease emergence. Data on parasite prevalence generated from the abalone health management program between 2000 and 2004 was analysed for trends. Abalone were sampled systematically from participating farms and subjected to gross and histological examination. Data on age, size, gonad development, diet and type of system were recorded. This paper presents the most significant results for gut protozoa, digestive gland protozoa and rickettsia like prokaryotes. which are all gut associated. Prevalence was found to increase with increasing age and size. Higher parasite prevalences were found on the West coast than on the South coast, and outside Hermanus compared to within Hermanus, suggesting that concentration of farms is not leading to increased prevalence. Gut associated parasites were significantly more prevalent in animals fed on kelp than artificial feed. It was found that animals younger than 24 months are more at risk of infection when fed kelp than older animals. The results indicate that separation of age groups, removal of poor performers and use of artificial feed, especially in younger animals, are likely to reduce risk of infection with gut associated parasites.

Brood stock abalone were induced to spawn by exposure to air for 2 h at 27 degreesC. Female abalone spawned a mean of 76,530 eggs. Fertilised eggs measured 180 [mum in diameter. Seventy percent survival was obtained during larval rearing. Larvae passed trochophore, veliger, gliding and creeping stages and were induced to settle on a mat of diatoms containing Nitszchia sp. and Navicula sp. The larval rearing period of H. varia ranged from 4 to 6 days at 27 degreesC. The settled spat vigorously fed on the diatom mat until the 50th day of postfertilisation and coralline red algal film, until the 70th day of postfertilisation. First respiratory pore was formed on the 27th day of postfertilisation. Juvenile abalones were reared on three algal diets such as coralline red algae, green filamentous algae and Ova lactuca from the 71st to 200th day of postfertilisation. Those fed with coralline algae showed best and consistent growth. Shell colour of juveniles was affected by diet.

The possible inositol-synthesizing capacity of intestinal microflora was also examined. Seven semipurified diets were formulated to provide graded levels of myo-inositol (28.7-1020.1 mg/kg diet). A control diet, the basal diet supplemented with 4 g/kg tetracycline hydrochloride, was employed to suppress synthesis of myo-inositol by intestinal bacteria. Abalone juveniles of similar size (weight, 144.6 +/- 0.8 mg; shell length, 10.92 +/- 0.10 mm) were distributed in a flow-through system using a completely randomized design with eight treatments and three replicates per treatment. They were fed the appropriate diets once daily for 16 wk. Survival, growth, crude protein, lipid, moisture of whole soft body and visceral inositol content were independent of myo-inositol supplementation (P > 0.05). The addition of the antibiotic also did not affect the survival, growth and whole soft body composition. It indicated that intestinal microflora contributed little to the myo-inositol nutrition in abalone. The present study, for the first time, demonstrated de novo synthesis of myo-inositol in mollusks because the visceral tissue of abalone showed high levels of myo-inositol synthetase activities (combined activities of myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthetase and inositol-1-phosphatase), ranging from 74.0 to 98.2 mu mol/(h.g protein).

C. sublittoralis can grow well in a range of light intensities (830-1,217 lux) and is thus Suited for the changing light conditions in a commercial abalone nursery. Achnanthes longipes grows well under high light conditions (1,412-4,400 lux) at low (18 degrees C) and high (25 degrees C) temperatures indicating that this species is more suited to culture in unshaded tanks and higher in the water Column, Oil plates closer to the water surface. Cocconeis sublittoralis and Navicula cf. jeffreyi were cultured together to investigate competitive interactions between the two species. Throughout the experiment Navicula cf. jeffreyi was significantly higher in cell density when grown separately compared with the combined Culture with C. sublittoralis. However when considering cell Volume C. sublittoralis is substantially larger with a Cell Volume of 20,183 mu m(3) compared with 367 mu m(3) for N. cf. jeffreyi. Thus the cell density of N. cf. jeffreyi must be around 4 times higher than C. sublittoralis to achieve similar biomass, N. cf. jeffreyi which was only the case at the start of the experiment. Hence N. cf. jeffreyi is a pioneer species (early colonizer) whereas C. sublittoralis is likely to eventually out compete N. cf. jeffreyi. Cocconeis sublittoralis is a suitable diatom species for commercial abalone nurseries, particularly when larger photophobic juveniles (+5 mm shell length) are cultured and shading is often necessary. The percentage of protein was significantly higher in N. cf. jeffreyi in comparison with the other two species whereas A. longipes contained significantly higher percentage lipid. At a commercial scale juvenile abalone were successfully maintained on diatom diets for at least 18 wk (to ca. 8 mm in SL) after which growth slowed. All diatom species declined in density after week 18 coinciding with a drop in temperature from 20.38 +/- 0.09 degrees C at the beginning of the experiment to 16.23 +/- 0.11 degrees C. Juveniles feeding on N. cf. jeffreyi and A. longipes reached only 9.99 +/- 3.52 and 9.49 +/- 3.21 mm, respectively, in nursery tanks after 24 wk. The biomass of these later two species was lowest overall because of the small cell volume of N. cf. jeffreyi and low cell density of A. longipes. Shell length reached 10.71 +/- 3.58 and 10.42 +/- 3.71 mm in the C. sublittoralis and mixed diatom treatments, respectively. Specific growth rates and weight gain were highest in the mixed treatment and biomass was highest in this treatment from week four onwards.

Juveniles were exposed for 16 weeks (i.e. 12 weeks of exposure and 4 weeks of decontamination phase) and their growth, intake rate, conversion rate and metallic concentrations were monitored. A total of 6 conditions were tested: a control, 4 concentrations based on Al and a trophic control. Results showed that the mortality reached 57% for individuals exposed to 1125 mu g L-1 of Al, and the abalone growth significantly decreased for an Al concentration greater than 495 mu g L-1. At the highest exposure concentration, intake rate measurements revealed that the appetite of abalones was affected, supported by the large increase in the conversion rate which was indicative of a poor feed efficiency. The monitoring of metallic concentrations showed that H. tuberculata strongly bioconcentrated Al relative to zinc. The diet did not appear to be the primary pathway for metal entry. Concentrations that significantly impacted abalone growth and survival during the experiment were higher than those found in natural environment, but the bioconcentration of Al into the tissues of a primary consumer such as abalone may be a potential pathway for Al to enter food webs.",10.1007/s00244-022-00975-y

In addition, rHdMac possessed binding activities towards glucan, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and peptidoglycan (PGN), but not chitin in vitro. Membrane integrity analysis revealed that rHdMac could increase the membrane permeability of bacteria. Meanwhile, both the phagocytosis and chemotaxis ability of hemocytes could be significantly enhanced by rHdMac.

For this purpose, we exposed zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) to three nutritional conditions, for 42 days: (1) one group was fed with 1x10(6) algal cells per mussel and per day, (2) a second group was fed with 10% of the previous food intake (1310 5 cells per mussel and per day), and (3) the third one was deprived of food. Hemocyte responses were assessed by flow cytometry every week for 42 days. Food deprivation was associated with a significant decrease in granulocyte size. Phagocytic activity increased in mussels exposed to the three diets, but it was more pronounced in mussels partially deprived of food (10% food intake). Mussels exposed to stressful nutritional conditions (10% and 0%) displayed significantly decreased oxidative activity from 14 days of exposure, whereas those fed on a normal diet displayed stable intracellular oxidative activity throughout the experiment. This study shows that nutritional conditions affect hemocyte morphometry and activity. Zebra mussel sensitivity to the nutritional conditions seemed low, even with total food deprivation for 42 days.

Here, we monitor health of the model coral Acropora millepora adjacent to a high-use and an unused reef-based tourist platform, plus a nearby control site without a platform, over 7 months spanning a typical austral summer. Comparisons of temporal patterns in a range of biochemical and genetic immune parameters (Toll-like receptor signalling pathway, lectin-complement system, prophenoloxidase-activating system and green fluorescent protein-like proteins) among healthy, injured and diseased corals revealed that corals exhibit a diverse array of immune responses to environmental and anthropogenic stressors. In healthy corals at the control site, expression of genes involved in the Toll-like receptor signalling pathway (MAPK p38, MEKK1, cFos and ATF4/5) and complement system (C3 and Bf) was modulated by seasonal environmental factors in summer months. Corals at reef platform sites experienced additional stressors over the summer, as evidenced by increased expression of various immune genes, including MAPK p38 and MEKK1. Despite increased expression of immune genes, signs of white syndromes were detected in 31% of study corals near tourist platforms in the warmest summer month. Evidence that colonies developing disease showed reduced expression of genes involved in the complement pathway prior to disease onset suggests that their immune systems may have been compromised. Responses to disease and physical damage primarily involved the melanization cascade and GFP-like proteins, and appeared to be sufficient for recovery when summer heat stress subsided. Overall, seasonal and anthropogenic factors may have interacted synergistically to overwhelm the immune systems of corals near reef platforms, leading to increased disease prevalence in summer at these sites.",10.1093/conphys/cov032

Survival rates of juvenile abalone were 2.00, 2.16, and 1.28% in the tank of NIM, GMM and WMS, respectively. The specific growth rates of juvenile abalone were 3.28, 3.07, and 2.92% in tanks with NIM, GMM, and WMS, respectively. The average live feed consumption rate by each abalone per day was 0.17, 0.15, and 0.26% of the benthic diatom standing crop in cultures of NIM, GMM, and WMS, respectively. In conclusion, mono-strain benthic diatoms exhibited higher settlement and growth of abalone larvae than did cultures of a wild mixed strain.",

Abalone and sea cucumbers were co-cultured at density ratios of both 3: 1 and 6: 1 for 1 yr. Abalone were fed with fresh kelp and no additional feed was given to sea cucumbers. Survival of abalone and sea cucumber was 100% for all treatments. Abalone and sea cucumber grew well; the body weight (BW) of abalone and sea cucumber was nearly doubled and had reached a commercial size. There were no significant differences in the growth rates for both abalone and sea cucumber between the two density treatments. The specific growth rate of BW of abalone (SGRbw) was highest in June, with a value of 0.536%/ d. Growth rate of sea cucumber (SGRsc) was highest in December, reached 1.84%/ d, with an annual average SGRsc of 0.182%/ d.

Density and food were manipulated to test their interacting effects on the growth and survival of hatchery produced postlarval Haliotis rubra. Feeding and dispersive behavior was also examined. Initial densities ranged between the densities used in aquaculture and those reported in the natural environment. Higher initial density increased the mortality rates of postlarvae in two experiments. Simultaneous manipulation of diatom food supply and density showed that the effect of density on mortality was mostly independent of food. Growth was strongly related to food supply, but also significantly reduced by high initial density, and these effects were additive. When diatom density was low, postlarvae did not increase rasping rates so the effect was that food was consumed more slowly. This explains the strong effect of food supply on growth. No aggressive interactions between feeding postlarvae were observed, but they graze intensively, leaving small distinct patches that have been cleared of algal food. Postlarvae encountering patches without food move rapidly and apparently randomly in search of food. The dispersal rate of postlarvae increased with density, presumably because post larvae spent more time searching for food. This searching is likely to be energetically expensive. and would increase at high densities because more cleared patches are created. This may explain why high initial densities of postlarvae had persistent reduced growth even when food was abundant, but does not explain the increased mortality at high density irrespective of food supply. We hypothesize that this effect may be attributable to other factors, such as the increased transmission of a pathogen at high density.",

In marine molluscs, while the physiological effects of OA are well known, with a reduction of growth and shell calcification, there are few studies on behavioural effects. A large marine gastropod, Haliotis tuberculata, was exposed to ambient (pHT 8.0) or low pH (pHT 7.7) during a 5-month experiment. Because animal fitness can be affected through various behavioural changes, a broad spectrum of behavioural parameters was investigated, including situations involving no stress, responses to predators, righting to evaluate indirectly the level of energy reserves, and finally, reproductive behaviour. In addition, we measured the expression profile of the GABA A-like and serotonin receptor genes, often described as central neuromodulators of sensory performance and behaviour and known to be affected by OA in molluscs. No significant effect of low pH as compared to ambient pH was observed on abalone behaviour for any of these behavioural traits or gene expressions after either one week or several months of exposure to OA. The significance tests were corroborated by estimating the size of pH effects. The behaviour of this mollusc appears not to be affected by pH decrease expected by the end of the century, suggesting some resilience of the species to OA at the adult stage. This is probably related to the ecological niche of this abalone, where important pH variations can be observed at tidal, diurnal or seasonal scales.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167526

In this study, two invertebrate Grxs (AbGrx1-like and AbGrx2) from disk abalone were identified and characterized in an effort to gain a deeper understanding into their immune and redox regulatory roles. Both AbGrxs share typical thioredoxin/Grx structures. AbGrx1-like and AbGrx2 were identified as monothiol and diothiol Grxs, respectively. AbGrxs were significantly expressed at the egg and 16-cell stage of early abalone development. Although the expression of both AbGrxs demonstrated similar patterns, the expression of AbGrx1-like was higher than AbGrx2 during development stages. In contrast, AbGrx2 expression was significantly higher than that of AbGrx1-like in adult tissues. Highest AbGrx1-like expression was observed in the hepatopancreas and digestive tract, while highest AbGrx2 expression was found in the gills, followed by the mantle, in healthy adult abalone tissues. The highest expression of AbGrx1-like was observed in the gills at 12 h and 6 h post injection (p.i) of Vibrio parahemolyticus and other stimulants, respectively. The highest expression of AbGrx2 in the gills were observed at 120 h, 6 h, 24 h, and 12 h post injection of V. parahaemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes, Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, and Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, respectively. AbGrxs possessed significant 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide (HED) and dehydroascorbate (DHA) reduction activity, but AbGrx2 exhibited higher redox activity than AbGrx1-like. Altogether, our results suggest an important role of AbGrx1-like and AbGrx2 in redox homeostasis, as well as in the invertebrate immune defense system.

Here we report a new variant of the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai that displays a novel orange shell coloration (O-type) that is clearly distinguishable from the Wild green-shelled abalone (G-type). Controlled mating experiments between O- and G-type abalones demonstrated apparent Mendelian segregations (1:1 or 3:1) in shell colors in F(2) families, which support the notion that the O- and G-types are under strict genetic control at a single locus With a recessive o (for orange shell) allele and a dominant G (for green shell) allele. Feeding with different diets caused modifications of shell color within each genotype, ranging from orange to yellow for O-type and green to dark-brown for the G-type, without affecting the distinction between genotypes. A previously described bluish-purple (B-type) shell color was found in one of the putative oo X oG crosses, suggesting that the B-type may be it recessive allele belonging to the same locus. The new O-type variant had no effect on the growth of Pacific abalone on the early seed-stage.

The injections were given at 0 (control), 20, and 200 ng/g body weight (BW), at 1-wk intervals for 14 wk. BW and shell length (SL) were measured every week, and growth rates were calculated.

There is also increasing evidence for a pathogenic role of iron in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which may progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. Mouse models of hereditary hemochromatosis and NAFLD can be used to explore potential interactions between iron and lipid metabolic pathways. Hfe-/- mice, a model of moderate iron overload, were reported to develop early liver fibrosis in response to a high fat diet. However, this was not the case with Hjv-/- mice, a model of severe iron overload. These data raised the possibility that the Hfe gene may protect against liver injury independently of its iron regulatory function. Herein, we addressed this hypothesis in a comparative study utilizing wild type, Hfe-/-, Hjv-/- and double Hfe-/- Hjv-/- mice. The animals, all in C57BL/6J background, were fed with high fat diets for 14 weeks and developed hepatic steatosis, associated with iron overload. Hfe co-ablation did not sensitize steatotic Hjv-deficient mice to liver injury. Moreover, we did not observe any signs of liver inflammation or fibrosis even in single steatotic Hfe-/- mice. Ultrastructural studies revealed a reduced lipid and glycogen content in Hjv-/- hepatocytes, indicative of a metabolic defect. Interestingly, glycogen levels were restored in double Hfe-/- Hjv-/- mice, which is consistent with a metabolic function of Hfe. We conclude that hepatocellular iron excess does not aggravate diet-induced steatosis to steatohepatitis or early liver fibrosis in mouse models of hereditary hemochromatosis, irrespectively of the presence or lack of Hfe.",10.1371/journal.pone.0221455

The aim of the present study was to determine the antioxidant activity and oxidative stressoriented apoptosis pathway in saccharides supplemented cryopreserved sperm of Pacific abalone. Cryopreserved sperm showed impaired antioxidant defenses due to the reduced mRNA abundance of antioxidant genes (CAT, Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, GPx, GR, and BCL-2), apoptosis inhibitor (HSP70, and HSP90) gene, and enzymatic antioxidant activity compared to fresh sperm. Such impaired antioxidant defenses caused an increase in the mRNA expression of apoptosis genes (Bax, and Caspase-3), finally leading to apoptosis. The impaired antioxidant defense also increased O(2)(center dot-)production and lipid peroxidation (MDA) levels, which further accelerated apoptosis. Considering all the experimental findings, an apoptosis pathway of cryopreserved sperm has been adopted for the first time. Specifically, sperm cryopreserved using 3% sucrose combined with 8% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) showed improved mRNA stability, enzymatic activity, and DNA integrity with reduced O-2(center dot-) production and MDA levels compared to sperm cryopreserved with the other types of examined cryoprotectants (8% ethylene glycol + 1% glucose, 6% propylene glycol + 2% glucose, 2% glycerol + 3% glucose, and 2% methanol + 4% trehalose).

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) has a positive effect on inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B)-mediated inflammation. The underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear, particularly in mollusks. Consequently, this study will investigate the process of vitamin D-3/VDR regulating NF-kappa B pathway and further explore their functions on inflammation, autophagy, and apoptosis in abalone Haliotis discus hannai. Results showed that knockdown of VDR by using siRNA and dsRNA of VDR in vitro and in vivo led to more intense response of NF-kappa B signaling to lipopolysaccharide and higher level of apoptosis and autophagy. In addition, 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 stimulation after VDR silencing could partially alleviate apoptosis and induce autophagy. Overexpression of VDR restricted the K48-polyubiquitin chain-dependent inhibitor of kappa B (I kappa B) ubiquitination and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) oligomerization. Besides, VDR silencing resulted in increase of ASC speck formation. In further mechanistic studies, we showed that VDR can directly bind to I kappa B and IKK1 in vitro and in vivo. In the feeding trial, H&E staining, TUNEL, and electron microscope results showed that vitamin D-3 deficiency (0 IU/kg) could recruit more basophilic cells and increase more TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells and lipid droplets (LDs) than vitamin D-3 supplement (1000 IU/kg and 5000 IU/kg). In summary, abalone VDR plays a negative regulator role in NF-kappa B-mediated inflammation via interacting with I kappa B and inhibiting ubiquitin-dependent degradation of I kappa B. Vitamin D-3 in combination with VDR is essential to establish a delicate balance between autophagy and apoptosis in response to inflammation.",10.1007/s10565-021-09647-4

The 2163-bp cDNA contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1878 bp, a 42-bp 5'-untranslated region (UTR), and a 243-bp 3'-UTR including a stop codon (TAG), a poly A tail, and a putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) 14 bp upstream of the poly A tail. The ORF encoded a protein of 626 amino acids (aa) with a predicted molecular mass of 71.3 kDa and an estimated pI of 5.55. The grouper Mx sequence contained putative functional domains including a tripartite guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding motif (GDQSSGKS, DLPG, and TKPD), the signature of the dynamin family (LPRGSGIVTR), and a putative leucine zipper in the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein. Sequence comparison showed that the Mx gene of this grouper had overall respective identities of 70%-96%, 51%-56%, and 34% to those of teleosts, mammals, and the abalone (Haliotis discus discus), respectively. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that the cloned Mx (TGMx) from tiger grouper was more-correlated with orange-spotted grouper MxII (gMxII). TGMx was constitutively expressed in all tissues, and its expression was upregulated by poly I: C and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), especially after a poly I: C injection. The Mx expressions had significantly increased in the eyes, head kidney, spleen, intestines, liver and gills after the LPS injection, and in all tested tissues after the poly I: C injection as compared to the groupers injected with PBS. The quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that Mx mRNA expression in the spleen and head kidney of grouper fed a diet containing sodium alginate and then injected with poly I: C after 12 h significantly increased, compared to those of fish fed a control diet (without sodium alginate). We therefore recommend an LPS and poly I: C injection to induce TGMx expression which was further enhanced by dietary sodium alginate administration. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This study compared the pathologic changes that occur during the progression of WS in red abalone to those caused by environmental stresses consisting of elevated temperature and food limitation and determined the impact of these stressors on WS prevalence and intensity. Farmed red abalone were administered a feed-based oxytetracycline therapeutic treatment to assure WS-RLP-free status prior to initiation of the experiment. Groups were then held in each of eight combinations of exposed vs. unexposed to WS-RLP, elevated vs. ambient temperature, and high vs. low food supply, for 447 days. Mortality was associated with starvation and disease but not elevated temperature alone. Elevated temperature significantly affected WS-RLP transmission: only 1.7% of WS-RLP-exposed abalone held at ambient temperature (12.3 degrees C) became infected compared to at least 72% of those held at elevated temperature (18.7 degrees C). Among exposed abalone at elevated temperature, fed animals exhibited greater infection prevalence but not greater infection intensity or digestive gland changes than starved animals, suggesting that abalone acquire infections by ingesting contaminated food. Food, temperature, WS-RLP exposure, and most of their interactions had significant effects on body condition and foot atrophy. Immunohistochemical detection of cell proliferation and apoptosis revealed no differences between normal digestive gland and that infected with WS-RLP. Body mass shrinkage, foot atrophy, elevated mortality, and decreased foot and digestive gland glycogen were observed in both WS-affected and starved, unexposed abalone, with the WS-RLP-exposed, starved group held at elevated temperature faring worst. Among exposed and unexposed animals, food Supply but not temperature affected body mass and growth. These data demonstrate that the high morbidity and mortality exhibited by WS-RLP-infected abalone is a consequence of disease and not direct thermal stress. Drug residue analysis indicated oxytetracycline concentrations of up to 600 ppm in the digestive gland at 38 days post-treatment, an unusual degree of tissue retention of this therapeutant.

These stressful conditions lead to hyperglycemia and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in oxidative stress and subsequent cell damage in the organism. To understand the role of insulin-related peptides in the regulation of elevated hemolymph glucose, hyperglycemia was confirmed in abalone under high water temperature and air (emersion) exposure (p < 0.05). To prove the existence of a glucose regulatory system in abalone, changes in hemolymph glucose were measured after bovine insulin injection, and hemolymph glucose was lowered by bovine insulin injection in hyperglycemia caused by both stressors (p < 0.05), supporting the existence of a glucose regulatory system functionally similar to that of vertebrates. Among the three abalone insulin-related peptides (AIPs), which were previously reported to be upregulated along with hemolymph glucose levels upon feeding, the relative mRNA expression of AIP2 in the cerebral ganglion showed a close correlation with high water temperature and emersion stress, which peaked 12 h after treatment (p < 0.05). Based on these results, we focused on the function of AIP2 in glucose homeostasis and characterized the localization of AIP2 mRNA-expressing cells in the cerebral ganglion using in situ hybridization. Positive signals from RNA probes were detected in neural cortex cells in the cerebral ganglion. Furthermore, suppressing AIP2 mRNA expression using RNA interference with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) revealed that dsRNA-AIP2 injected abalone maintained high hemolymph glucose levels after 24 h of recovery following 1 h of emersion stress (p < 0.01). In contrast, abalones that received dsRNA-GFP and molluscan saline showed relatively rapid clearance of hemolymph glucose.

A de novo transcriptome assembly with subsequent quantitative PCR and correlation network analysis of genes involved in the molecular response were used to unravel the correlations between gene expression patterns under the different experimental conditions. The correlation networks identified a shift from the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism (down-regulated) to the up-regulation of Hsp70 during warming under all experimental conditions in gill and muscle, indicating a strong up-regulation of damage prevention and repair systems at sustained cellular energy production. However, a higher capacity for anaerobic succinate production was evicted in gill, matching with observations from our previous studies indicating succinate accumulation in gill but not in muscle.

After 8 weeks, yellow catfish (initial weight: 2.12 +/- A 0.01 g) fed isonitrogenous and isolipid diets containing < 0.05 (deficient dietary Se) or 6.5 (excess dietary Se) mg Se/kg displayed a significantly lower weight gain ratio (WGR) than those fed a diet containing 0.23 (normal dietary Se) mg Se/kg. As dietary Se levels increased, liver Se concentration, glutathione peroxidase activity and the hepatosomatic index increased significantly. Plasma glucose concentration was highest in the normal treatment compared with the excess dietary Se treatment. Both deficient and excess dietary Se lead to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis ratio in blood cells, whereas only excess dietary Se increased their cytoplasmic free-Ca2+ (CF-Ca2+) concentration. Excess dietary Se also resulted in the highest level of HSP70 expression, thereby possibly providing a protective mechanism against oxidative stress. These results indicate that both deficient and excess dietary Se restrained the growth of juvenile yellow catfish and caused oxidative stress. The overproduction of ROS may act as a signal molecule mediate apoptosis when dietary Se deficiency. Both ROS and CF-Ca2+ were recorded when dietary Se excess, suggesting that Ca2+ may be activated by Se and play a major role during Se-induced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis.",10.1007/s10695-015-0133-y

Each of six groups of abalones was fed a different diet consisting of powdered algae over an 84-day period. Of the six diets, three consisted of a single algal species, i. e., the brown alga Laminaria japonica (L), the green alga Ulva lactuca (U), and the red alga Gracilaria lemaneiformis (G). The remaining three diets had different 1: 1 mixtures of the algal species, i. e., L. japonica and U. lactuca (LU), L. japonica and G. lemaneiformis (LG), and U. lactuca and G. lemaneiformis (UG). The FA profiles of the abalone soft body showed clear changes over the experimental period and differed significantly between the different diet groups. Analyses of variation of specific FAs and multidimensional scaling ordination of overall FA profiles showed that H. discus hannai absorbed L. japonica preferentially over G. lemaneiformis in the dietary group LG and discriminated against U. lactuca in groups LU and UG. Additionally, abalone in group LG had the highest specific growth rate (SGR= 0.73 +/- 0.06% d(-1)), while those in group U had the lowest (0.36 +/- 0.07% d(-1)).

Our results suggest that behaviour is also affected by density and this also has a significant impact on the growth of individual abalone. 1800 juveniles of Haliotis rubra were individually tagged and reared for 5 months in 12 gravity-fed tanks at two levels of density. The experimental design allowed the differentiation of the direct from the indirect effects of density. The abalone growth and distribution was monitored monthly along with the water quality. The distribution of abalone during daytime was closely related to the availability of preferred shelter space. The percentage of abalone stacked on the top of others increased with density. Preferred shelter space was characterized by low light intensity and a corner or edge for the abalone to rest against. Hides at the ends of the tanks were not occupied as much as others. Abalone were found crawling on the side of the tank during daytime when tanks were shaded. Abalone juveniles of 15-60 mm showed fidelity to their resting shelter during daytime but this fidelity was significantly reduced at the higher density. Shading of the tanks totally changed the distribution of the abalone and their daytime behaviour. Competition for shelter space reduced growth more than water quality.,10.1023/B:AQUI.0000004194.85299.38

In the current study, we identified, cloned, and characterized a gene that encodes an invertebrate-type lysozyme from the disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus (abLysI). The full-length cDNA of abLysl consisted of 545 bp with an open reading frame of 393 bp that encodes 131 amino acids. The theoretical molecular mass of mature abLysI was 12.3 kDa with an isoelectric point of 8.03. Conserved features in other homologs, such as catalytic sites for lytic activity (Glu(30) and Asp(41)), isopeptidase activity (His(107)), and ten cysteine residues were identified in abLysl. Genomic sequence analysis with respect to its cDNA showed that abLysl was organized into four exons interrupted by three introns. Several immune-related transcription factor binding sites were discovered in the putative promoter region. Homology and phylogeny analysis of abLysl depicted high identity and closer proximity, respectively, with an annelid i-type lysozyme from Hirudo medicinalis, and indicated that abLysI is a novel molluscan i-type lysozyme. Tissue-specific expressional studies revealed that abLysl is mainly transcribed in hepatopancreas followed by mantle. In addition, abLysl mRNA expression was induced following bacterial (Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes) and viral (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus) challenges. Recombinantly expressed abLysI [(r)abLysI] demonstrated strong lytic activity against Micro coccus lysodeikticus, isopeptidase activity, and antibacterial activity against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, (r)abLysI showed optimum lytic activity at pH 4.0 and 60 degrees C, while exhibiting optimum isopeptidase activity at pH 7.0. Taken together, these results indicate that abLysI is potentially involved in immune responses of the disk abalone to protect it from invaders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Wild and cultured abalone both attract premium prices, but generally this is not based on sensory characteristics. Yet, abalone aquaculture is developing to provide an alternative to a dwindling supply of wild abalone, and this provides an opportunity to optimize the sensory properties if they are better understood. In most natural food products, farming practices and growing environment are responsible for the sensory properties of the final product; therefore, the comparison of both wild and aquacultured abalone's sensory characteristics could contribute to a better understanding of the impact of the growing and farming practices on the sensory properties. Our study focused on the development of a descriptive sensory analysis methodology to measure abalone sensory properties, and the observation of differences among the abalone sampled. Wild and aquacultured abalone were prepared according to a standardized cooking protocol. A sensory panel of trained assessors developed and defined a descriptive vocabulary and a method of assessment, and then quantified the sensory properties of abalone. A vocabulary of 16 terms describing aroma, texture, flavor, and aftertaste of the abalone was developed. Very significant differences were found between abalone sourced from the wild and aquacultured abalone from different sources. The wild-caught blacklip abalone, which were larger in size, were perceived as more firm, springy, and chewy, but also rated significantly higher in aroma, flavor, and aftertaste impact as well as earthy and metallic flavors. Significant differences in sensory properties were also found between cultured abalone fed different diets. Compositional analysis showed significant differences between abalone in their content of glycogen (range, 4.8% 23.2% of dry weight (DW)), moisture (69.4% 73.7% live weight), and taste-active free amino acids, especially glycine (3.4-18.2 mg/g DW) and glutamate (1.0-3.6 mg/g DW). Correlations were found between sensory attributes and some chemical compounds. This study indicates that growing conditions as well as growing techniques may have a large influence on abalone sensory characteristics. However, because the design of the study was not balanced for key growth or production variables, additional studies are required to identify and quantify which factors were most influential. The descriptive sensory method developed was successful in measuring the sensory properties of abalone and can now be applied more broadly.",10.2983/035.032.0114

In these systems fish is cultured next to other organisms, which are converting otherwise discharged nutrients into valuable products. These conversions are analyzed based on nitrogen and phosphorous balances using a mass balance approach. The analytical concept of this review comprises a hypothetical system design with five modules: (1) the conversion of feed nutrients into fish biomass, the Fish-Biomass-Converter; (2) the separation of solid and dissolved fish waste/nutrients; the Fish-Waste-Processor; (3) the conversion of dissolved fish waste/nutrients, the Phototrophic-herbivore-Converter; (4 and 5) the conversion of solid fish waste, the Bacterial-Waste-Converter, or the Detrivorous-Converter. In the reviewed examples, fish culture alone retains 20-50% feed nitrogen (N) and 15-65% feed phosphorous (P). The combination of fish culture with phototrophic conversion increases nutrient retention of feed N by 15-50% and feed P by up to 53%. If in addition herbivore consumption is included, nutrient retention decreases by 60-85% feed N and 50-90% feed P. This is according to the general observation of nutrient losses from one trophic level to the next. The conversion of nutrients into bacteria and detrivorous worm biomass contributes only in smaller margins (e.g. 7% feed N and 6% feed P and 0.06% feed N 0.03 x 10(-3)% feed P, respectively). All integrated modules have their specific limitations, which are related to uptake kinetics, nutrient preference, unwanted conversion processes and abiotic factors. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In the natural environment, abalone larvae settle on coralline red algae, which provide one of the strongest and most consistent settlement cues available for abalone larvae. However. propagation of coralline red algae is not practical commercially. Abalone farms in Japan successfully settle abalone larvae (Haliotis discus hannai) on the green alga Ulvella lens. U. lens also proved to be Suitable to enhance settlement of cultured southern Australian abalone species (Haliotis laevigata. H. rubra). Most abalone farms in Australia are now growing U. lens for that purpose. U. lens is easy to culture. no specific facilities are needed and the alga can be grown on PVC settlement plates in commercial nursery tanks. However, U. lens has limited value as a feed for young postlarvae. Instead. cultured diatoms can be added after larvae successfully settle and start feeding. Juvenile abalone (> 3 mm in shell length) can consume U. lens and grow rapidly on this alga. Diatom cultures and biofilms developing on settlement plates are not axenic and the role of bacteria in early postlarvae feeding is poorly understood. It has been suggested that bacteria may perform metabolic activities in the undeveloped gut of young postlarvae. At later stages of the nursery phase it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain adequate feed on the plates and this is still regarded as a significant bottleneck for the abalone aquaculture industry. Recent investigations have indicated that sporelings of macroalgae like Ulva sp. or diatoms that can provide more biomass may provide a suitable additional food source for juveniles (> 3 mm in shell length).",10.2983/0730-8000(2006)25[151:TROBAM]2.0.CO;2

This article describes the threats from infectious diseases in aquaculture and then focuses on one example (QX disease in Sydney rock oysters) as a case study. QX appears to be typical of many emerging diseases in aquaculture, particularly because environmental factors seem to play a crucial role in disease outbreaks.

In recent years, the frequent occurrence of the disease has led to significant mortality in abalone farms. Deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 (DMBT1), a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) protein family, plays an important role in host defense. However, its function in H. diversicolor remains unknown. In order to evaluate the immune priming effect after secondary infection and elucidate possible regulatory mechanism, a novel DMBT1 from the small abalone H. diversicolor (designated as HdDMBT1) was cloned and characterized in this study. The open reading frame of HdDMBT1 was 2331 bp encoding 776 amino acids with a molecular weight of 84.73 kDa. HdDMBT1 contained conserved active sites with DMBT1 from other species, detected in all tested tissues and had higher expression levels in hepatopancreas. The temporal expression profiles of HdDMBT1 after two challenges of Vibrio harveyi were examined to evaluate priming response in the small abalone. The expression level of HdDMBT1 mRNA in hepatopancreas increased significantly after V. harveyi challenge. Meanwhile, the expression level of HdDMBT1 after the second challenge was significantly higher than that after the first challenge (4.23-fold). RNA interference (RNAi) experiments were conducted to examine the role of HdDMBT1 in response to V. harveyi infection. Knocking down HdDMBT1 decreased the hemocytes phagocytosis (0.48-fold). In addition, the bacterial density in hemolymph and the mortality of abalone raised, when infected with V. harveyi after dsHdDMBT1 injection.

In 2012, evidence of a putative bacteriophage associated with Ca. Xc in red abalone-Haliotis rufescens-was described. Recently, histologic examination of animals with Ca. Xc infection in California abalone populations universally appear to have the phage-containing inclusions. In this study, we investigated the current virulence of Ca. Xc in red abalone and white abalone at different environmental temperatures. Using a comparative experimental design, we observed differences over time between the two abalone species in mortality, body condition, and bacterial load by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). By day 251, all white abalone exposed to the current variant of Ca. Xc held in the warm water (18.5 degrees C) treatment died, while red abalone exposed to the same conditions had a mortality rate of only 10%, despite a relatively heavy bacterial burden as determined by qPCR of posterior esophagus tissue and histological assessment at the termination of the experiment. These data support the current status of Ca. Xc as less virulent in red abalone, and may provide correlative evidence of a protective phage interaction.

In the second experiment we have measured the effects of two different settlement substrates, combined with the presence of conspecifics, onmetamorphosis, survival and growth of post-larvae. The microalgae dietary treatments consisted in: Dunaliella tertiolecta (Duna); 50% mixture of Isochrysis galbana and D. tertiolecta (ID); 50% mixture of Chaetoceros gracilis and D. tertiolecta (CD); 33% mixture of I. galbana, C. gracilis and D. tertiolecta (ICD). Although all dietary treatments resulted in a good survival at competence, significant difference in post-larval survival was observed between treatments, and indeed, only larvae fed Duna and CD survived to 180 days post settlement (DPS). In the second experiment, the settlement substrates consisted in a film of cultured Ulvella lens or a naturally developing biofilm of diatoms, and the employed rearing water was either natural seawater or seawater previously exposed to P. lividus adults. At 10 DPS, larger (p < 0.05) post-larvae were observed in the natural biofilm treatment, whilst the presence of conspecifics significantly increased larval settlement in both substrates (p < 0.01). These results indicate that it is important to consider the survival of post-larvae and juveniles to establish the efficiency of the dietary treatment on the hatchery production of P. lividus. Furthermore, it suggests that improved settlement protocols, such as the use of conspecifics, could contribute to increase hatchery outputs. Finally, it confirms the suitability of U. lens as settlement cue but also highlights that further research is required to establish its effectiveness for post-larvae first feeding.

Traditionally, abalone farmers have used a combination of UV irradiation and application of temperature gradients to the tank water to artificially induce spawning. Proteins are known to regulate crucial processes such as respiration, muscle contraction, feeding, growth and reproduction. Spawning as a pre-requisite of abalone reproduction is likely to be regulated, in part, by endogenous proteins. A first step in elucidating the mechanisms that regulate spawning is to identify which proteins are directly involved during spawning. The present study examined protein expression following traditional spawning induction in the Haliotis laevigata female. Gonads were collected from abalone in the following physiological states: (1) spawning; (2) post-spawning; and (3) failed-to-spawn. Differential protein abundance was initially assessed using two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry for protein identification. A number of reproductive proteins such as vitellogenin, vitelline envelope zona pellucida domain 29 and prohibitin, and metabolic proteins such as thioredoxin peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and heat shock proteins were identified. Differences in protein abundance levels between physiological states were further assessed using scheduled multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. Positive associations were observed between the abundance of specific proteins, such as heat shock cognate 70 and peroxiredoxin 6, and the propensity or failure to spawn in abalone. These findings have contributed to better understand both the effects of oxidative and heat stress over abalone physiology and their influence on abalone spawning.

This research makes a case for the use of the randomized response technique (RRT) as a tool to inform conservation policy with respect to regulatory compliance. RRT was used to generate estimates of non-compliance in the Northern California recreational red abalone (Winds rufescens) fishery before and after the introduction of new tagging regulations and marine protected areas (MPAs). Anonymous paper-based compliance and sociodemographic surveys were conducted with recreational fishers in Sonoma and Mendocino Counties in August of 2007 and 2011. The 2011 survey found reductions in illegal take across most violation types, and since the introduction of on-animal tagging regulations the proportional daily take limit violation among local residents was found to have decreased from 72% to 43%. The results indicate higher non-compliance rates among visitors than local fishers regarding licensing laws, minimum size limits, and annual catch limits. Locals were proportionately more likely to violate the daily catch limit and the new regulations, though 85% of the fishers surveyed were aware of them. The rule-specific violation estimates RRT generates provide managers with a level of detail about non-compliant behavior that is unique, and can point to opportunities for improving managerial communication and enforcement.

A factorial experiment with three replicates per treatment in blocks was conducted for 44 days in 2-L plastic containers with ca. 100 postlarvae each, inoculated every week with the cultured diatom Navicula incerta. Survival was highest (80%) in the treatment without water flow and with light, whereas the lowest (52%) corresponded to the 600-mL/min flow rate under darkness, but these differences were not significant. Initial grazing rate was significantly higher in darkness than in light (37 cell/pl/hr, SE = 1.6, and 27 cell/pl/hr, SE = 2.8, respectively). Growth rate was not significantly affected by the light treatments. However, in static conditions growth was higher in darkness (38-mu m/day, SE = 2.0) than in light (34-mu m/day, SE = 1.0). Growth rates of postlarvae were significantly affected by flow conditions, with means of 36 (SE = 1.3), 33 (SE = 0.7) and 31 (SE = 0.7) mu m/day in flows of 0, 200 and 600 mL/min, respectively). These results suggest that the benefits of dark conditions on the growth rate of abalone postlarvae shown in previous experiments might not occur under flow conditions. However, the flow rates tested here were apparently too high to allow an optimal postlarval growth and slower flows should be tested in future experiments. On the other hand, flow allowed the development of high diatom densities under the light condition, which were difficult to maintain in darkness.",10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[789:EODAWF]2.0.CO;2

Various combinations of red algae (Palmaria palmata, Ceramium rubrum and Chondrus crispus cultured or harvested from the natural environment, as well as Porphyra spp. collected), brown algae (Laminaria digitata) and green algae (fresh or frozen Ulva intestinalis) were tested. The results showed that P. palmata, C. rubrum and U. intestinalis administered alone were associated with significantly higher weight growth rates than the other species of algae tested. However, some combinations of algae (i.e. different proportions of L. digitata in association with P palmata) were more favorable for weight increase when compared with the expected rates calculated for the diet based on L. digitata alone. Limiting the amount of any of these foods substantially reduced the conversion rate. Seasonal trends were apparent in both weight increase and food conversion rates, with the result that growth in weight on a diet of L. digitata was fastest in summer. Growth on P. palmata was faster in each season, and reached a maximum in early spring. The data collected allowed us to model weight increase and month-to-month food conversion rates for a diet based on P. palmata and L. digitata. The data obtained in this study were coupled with data regarding the availability of algae during the year, enabling us to suggest an optimal diet for each of the four seasons. Finally, the effects of different algae diets were investigated on hemocyte parameters, and the result suggested that P. palmata would reinforce the immune system of abalone.",10.1051/alr/2018018

Numerous studies have reported the crucial role of caveolin-1 (CAV1) in response to invading microbes; yet, very little is known about molluscan CAV1. In this study, we identified and characterized CAV1 ortholog from the disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus (HdCAV1). The cDNA sequence of HdCAV1 is 826 bp long and encodes a 127-amino acid polypeptide. Characteristic caveolin superfamily domain (Glu(3) - Lys(126)) and two possible transmembrane domains (Cys(48) - Tyr(67) and Ile(103) - Phe(120)) were identified in the HdCAV1 protein. Homology analysis revealed that HdCAV1 shared higher identity (>47%) with molluscans, but lower identity with other species. Phylogenetic tree constructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method revealed a distinct evolutionary pathway for molluscans. Transcriptional analysis by SYBR Green qPCR showed the highest expression of HdCAV1 mRNA in late veliger stage, as compared to that in other embryonic developmental stages of disk abalone. In adult animals, gill tissue showed highest HdCAV1 transcript levels under normal physiological condition. Stimulations with two bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes), viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, and two pathogen-associated molecular patterns (LPS and poly I:C) significantly modulated the expression of HdCAV1 transcripts. Collectively, these data suggest that CAV1 plays an important role in embryogenesis and host immune defense in disk abalone.",10.1016/j.gep.2017.11.003

The combined effect of low frequency climatic variability and anthropogenic perturbations can have dramatic consequences for abalone in southern California. Abalone species are tightly linked to kelp forest ecosystems that, besides furnishing habitat, also provide the main food source for abalone. In southern California, kelp canopies are very sensitive to oceanographic climate because the kelp depend upon high nutrients in the water column. Oceanic warming, in turn, results in decreased nutrients in the surface water, and this is correlated with marked reductions in giant kelp biomass. Here we address the additive effects of ocean warming on two species of California abalone (the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens; and the green abalone, H.fulgens) by subjecting them to varied environmental conditions similar to cool, normal, and warm phases of the California current in the southern California Bight. Our experimental design simultaneously tested the synergistic effects of temperature and food quantity and quality on survivorship, growth, and reproduction. For red abalone, warm temperatures increased the onset of withering syndrome, a fatal abalone disease, and halted growth and reproduction. In contrast, green abalone survivorship, growth, and reproduction were relatively robust irrespective of temperature, while their growth and reproduction were most strongly influenced by food quantity. We found clear evidence suggesting that, combined with overfishing, California abalone populations are adversely affected by ecosystem responses to ocean warming: Coolwater red abalone suffer stronger consequences in warm water than do green abalone. Conservation, restoration, and recovery plans of remnant California abalone populations must consider these relationships when taking any action.",10.1890/03-5326

Use of shell surfaces by black abalone appears not to be an evolved adaptive strategy. Individuals in stacks fed significantly more than expected, yet solitary abalone next to stacks shared food trapped by stacks. In the laboratory, starvation did not increase the propensity of an abalone to stack. Stacks were equally common in the breeding and non-breeding seasons, suggesting that stacking behavior was not a mechanism to enhance reproductive success. Stacking did not enhance avoidance of predators or competitors. Laboratory experiments showed that stacking is density dependent and probably the result of limitation of primary attachment space. Removals of significant predators (sea otters and Chumash Indians) of adult abalone during the past two centuries probably led to increased densities of black abalone, which in turn has had an indirect effect on the prevalence of stacking.",10.1016/0022-0981(87)90127-4

"Coyne, VE",The importance of ATP in the immune system of molluscs,2011,ISJ-INVERTEBRATE SURVIVAL JOURNAL,8,1,48,55,,"Molluscs rely on an innate immune system for defence against infection. Invading organisms are phagocytosed by circulating hemocytes and neutralised by a combination of hydrolytic enzymes and the production of reactive oxygen species. Phagocytosis, the central feature of the molluscan innate immune system, is an energy-demanding process as a consequence of actin polymerisation which requires a constant supply of ATP. Adenylate kinase, shown to couple local ATP supply and actomyosin assembly in macrophage cell lines, may play a similar role in molluscan hemocytes. Hemocyte conformational changes and chemotaxis are regulated via protein kinase C which is phosphorylated in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. ATP utilisation in protein kinase cascades is thought to be quite significant. The vast majority of the ATP required to support cellular functions in animal cells is generated via the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Disruption of this process with antimycin A resulted in a 50 % decrease in ATP levels in Haliotis midae hemocytes which also exhibited reduced phagocytic activity. Phosphoarginine and arginine kinase are thought to play a role in invertebrates that is similar to phosphocreatine and creatine kinase in vertebrates, by supplying additional ATP during periods of high energy demand. The energetically-expensive processes associated with the molluscan innate immune system, such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, formation and acidification of the phagolysosome, are severely compromised by abiotic stresses such as elevated water temperature and pollutants, reflecting the fine balance that must be maintained to ensure sufficient ATP is available for both general metabolism and the immune response.",

Abalone were exposed to three pCO(2) conditions for 1 year (ambient, similar to 880, and similar to 1600 mu atm), and parameters, induding mortality, physiology, immune system, biochemistry, and carry-over effects, were measured. Survival decreased significantly at similar to 800 mu atm pCO(2) for H. diversicolor, while H. discus hannai survival was negatively affected only at a higher OA level (similar to 1600 mu aim pCO(2)). H. diversicolor exhibited depressed metabolic and excretion rates and a higher O:N ratio under OA, indicating a shift to lipids as a metabolism substrate, while these physiological parameters in H. discus hannai were robust to OA. Both abalone failed to compensate for the pH decrease of their internal fluids because of the lowered hemolymph pH under OA. However, the reduced hcmolymph pH did not affect total hemocytc counts or tested biomarkers. Additionally, H. discus hannai increased its hemolyrnph protein content under OA, which could indicate enhanced immunity. larvae produced by adults exposed to the three pCO(2) levels were cultured in the same pCO(2) conditions and larval deformation and shell length were measured to observe carry-over effects.

Averaged across 20 species of macroalgae, the mean consumption rate was 4.96 +/- 0.27%wet-TW.d(-1) (wet alga and wet abalone; TW = total weight) or 1.37 +/- 0.19%dryTW.d(-1) (dry alga and dry abalone). On a long-term basis (20 days feeding), tokobushi had higher consumption rates on the green alga Ulva pertusa and the brown alga Sargassum fusiforme than on the red alga Meristotheca papulosa. When presented with a choice of species (3 days feeding), tokobushi ate more of the brown alga Sargassum fusiforme and the red alga Gracilaria gigas than the green alga Codium cylindricum. Consumption rates generally increased with temperature. Generally, tokobushi prefer macroalgae with high percent dry weight composition, most of which are brown and red algae, and eat more at water temperatures around spring/fall (17 degrees C. 21 degrees C) and summer (27 degrees C) in Kagoshima, Japan.",

Seven triplicate groups of juvenile abalone (mean weight: 0.74 +/- 0.01 g; mean shell length: 16.41 +/- 0.04 mm) were fed with one of seven semi-purified diets containing graded levels of dietary zinc (5.6, 10.7, 15.1, 25.2, 34.7, 45.3 and 84.6 mg/kg). To better understand the effects of dietary zinc on the shell deposition, the newly grown shell (NS) was separated from the old shell (OS) after a 16-week rearing period. Mineralogical (aragonite, calcite and dolomite [CaMg(CO3)(2)]) and chemical (Zn, Fe, Mg, Cu and Sr) compositions in both NS and OS were analyzed. Soluble matrix proteins (SMP) were extracted from both OS and NS, followed by amino acid composition analyses. The results showed that mineralogical and chemical compositions in OS were not significantly influenced by dietary zinc. In NS, however, increasing dietary zinc significantly decreased aragonite content, but significantly increased calcite content. Concentrations of Zn and Fe in NS significantly increased with dietary zinc. Patterns of amino acid compositions in NS significantly changed with dietary zinc levels. The ratio of acidic/basic amino acids positively correlated with the ratio of calcite/aragonite in NS. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",10.1016/S0022-0981(02)00472-0

We investigated the potential roles of elevated water temperature, food availability, and parasites (renal coccidia and rickettsiales-like procaryotes or RLPs) in this disease. Results from a temperature-feeding experiment suggested that elevated water temperature was not a direct cause of WS, but accelerated mortality. At a particular water temperature, both fed and starved abalone had similar survival. Abalone with WS fed on kelp until the animal reached the terminal stages of the disease, when visible atrophy of the foot muscle was easily observed. However, fed abalone held at an elevated water temperature, 20 degrees C, had decreased survival relative to those held at 13 degrees C. The lack of food in our investigations did not appear to be a direct cause of WS. In addition, no consistent statistically significant associations were identified between abalone condition and intensity of coccidian infection in both field and laboratory studies. No association was found between condition of the digestive gland and intensity of the RLP infection in our laboratory study. However, all abalone with degenerated digestive glands had visible signs of WS. Time to abalone death did not correlate with intensity of RLP infection, except in a pool of the 13 degrees C treatments and possibly the 13 degrees C starved treatment. Thus, at lower seawater temperatures, the RLP may affect survival. The significance of this observation may have resulted from small sample sizes. Only 22 abalone were included in the 13 degrees C treatment, and 4 of these were in the starved treatment. These data suggest that further investigation of the role of the RLP in WS is needed.",
"Pace, DA; Manahan, DT",Efficiencies and costs of larval growth in different food environments (Asteroidea: Asterina miniata),2007,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,353,1,89,106,,"The ocean is a nutritionally heterogeneous environment. For feeding larval forms, food variability has significant consequences for growth and later recruitment success. In this study, the physiological and biochemical responses to a range of different food concentrations (unfed, 4, 20, and 40 algal cells mu l(-1)) were examined in larvae of the asteroid, Asterina miniata. Measurements of growth, protein synthesis rates, and the energetic cost of protein synthesis were made. Under conditions of rapid growth, protein comprised a larger percent (66%) of a larva's organic biomass compared to similar-aged, slower-growing larvae (26%). Larvae fed at the highest food concentration tested (40 algal cells mu l(-1)) had a protein depositional efficiency of 80% (+/-16%), a value 3-fold higher than larvae fed 20 algal cells mu l(-1) (28%+/-11%). Also, faster-growing larvae required 3-fold less energy per unit mass of protein growth. Larvae fed 40 algal cells mu l(-1) deposited protein at a respiratory cost of 65+/-11 pmol O-2 h(-1) (mu g protein)(-1); larvae fed 20 algal cells mu l(-1) had a cost of 192+/-47 pmol O-2 h(-1) (mu g protein)(-1). While there were differences in the cost to deposit protein (i.e., protein growth, the balance of synthesis and degradation), there were no differences in the energetic cost of protein synthesis for all food concentrations tested. The energetic cost of protein synthesis was fixed at 13.8 (+/-0.92) Joules (mg protein synthesized)(-1) and was independent of developmental stage, growth rates, and large changes (58-fold) in protein synthesis rates. A major conclusion from this study is that larvae grown in high-food environments not only grew faster, but did so for considerably less energy. Defining the complex relationships of food availability and metabolic efficiency will provide more accurate predictions of larval growth under variable food conditions in the ocean.

Two macroalgal meals including Sargassum muticum (SM) and Gracilaria lemaneiformis (GL) and two lipid sources including fish oil (FO) and vegetable oil (VO) were formulated into four diets, i.e., S. muticum and fish oil (SF), S.muticum and vegetable oil (SV), G. lemaneiformis and fish oil (GF) and G. lemaneiformis and vegetable oil (GV). The results showed that the specific growth rates (SGR) of A. japonicus fed diets containing SM were significantly higher than those fed diets containing GL. No significant differences in SGR between the FO-based and VO-based groups were observed. Similar results were observed in the body wall lipid content. Most body wall FAs changed to resemble the dietary FA proportions because of the dietary effect. Concentrations of 20:4n-6 of the SF and GF groups were significantly lower than the SV and GV groups, while levels of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 were significantly higher than the SV and GV groups. The n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratios of the SF and GF groups were significantly higher than the SV and GV groups. Moreover, the SF group had significantly higher 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 contents and n-3/n-6 PUFAs ratio than the GF group.

One approach is to increase nitrogen reuse within the system by feeding nitrogen-rich aquaculture effluent to deposit feeders, thereby closing the aquaculture nitrogen-loop. This study, for the first time and on a laboratory-scale, has reared juveniles of the sea cucumber Holothuria scabra at high densities solely on particulate organic waste from a commercial-scale land-based abalone recirculating aquaculture system. Furthermore, growth rates and biomass yields were increased significantly by adjusting the effluent C:N from 5:1 to 20:1 by adding exogenous organic carbon sources (glucose, starch and cellulose), so fuelling accelerated heterotrophic bacterial production within the redox-stratified tank sediment. Sea cucumber juveniles reared solely on effluent had a biomass density of 711 gm(-2) after four months whereas animals reared on starch-amended effluent (the best performing treatment) had a final density of 1011 gm(-2). Further optimisation of this approach could increase biomass yields and pave the way for the commercial cultivation of deposit feeding animals on waste streams, thus contributing to more environmentally sustainable aquaculture. Here, the nitrogen that originated from fishmeal is not lost through the discharge of aquaculture effluent; rather, it is immobilised into single cell biomass that is up-cycled into high-value secondary biomass. We demonstrate that sea cucumbers can be produced at high density through the manipulation of the C:N ratio of aquaculture effluent.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.09.024

Changing the percentage dietary protein from 33% to 26% reduced the concentration of FAN (F-42,F- 252= 2.79; P<0.0001) in a serial-pass system and did not reduce weight gain (F-1,F- 12=1.09; P=0.31) or length gain (F-1,F- 12=1.08; P=0.31). Low water pH was the most important variable to contribute to a reduction in abalone growth (weight gain: F-1,F- 19=64.5; P<0.0001; r(2)=0.76; length gain: F-1,F- 19=41.9; P<0.0001; r(2)=0.67).

Natural recovery on San Nicolas Island (SNI) of Southern California suggested the development of resistance in island populations. Experimental challenges in one treatment demonstrated that progeny of disease-selected black abalone from SNI survived better than did those from naive black abalone from Carmel Point in mainland coastal central California. Unexpectedly, the presence of a newly observed bacteriophage infecting the WS rickettsia (WS-RLO) had strong effects on the survival of infected abalone. Specifically, presence of phage-infected RLO (RLOv) reduced the host response to infection, RLO infection loads, and associated mortality. These data suggest that the black abalone: WS-RLO relationship is evolving through dual host mechanisms of resistance to RLO infection in the digestive gland via tolerance to infection in the primary target tissue (the post-esophagus) coupled with reduced pathogenicity of the WS-RLO by phage infection, which effectively reduces the infection load in the primary target tissue by half. Sea surface temperature patterns off southern California, associated with a recent hiatus in global-scale ocean warming, do not appear to be a sufficient explanation for survival patterns in SNI black abalone. These data highlight the potential for natural recovery of abalone populations over time and that further understanding of mechanisms governing host parasite relationships will better enable us to manage declining populations.",10.3389/fmicb.2014.00078

However, the biological efficacy of nano-selenium has not been comprehensively and accurately evaluated due to its dispersion instability. RESULTS In this study, novel selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) with high dispersion stability were successfully prepared using a polysaccharide-protein complex (PSP) as the capping agent. This was isolated from abalone viscera. The average particle size and zeta potential of polysaccharide-protein complex selenium nanoparticles (PSP-SeNPs) were 63.33 nm, and -37.1 mV, respectively. The SeNPs were firmly capped by PSP through Se-O and Se-N bonds, as demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Due to this capping, the dispersion of PSP-SeNPs remained stable for 12 months at 4 degrees C, as evidenced by visual inspection and multiple light scattering. Furthermore, PSP-SeNPs imparted an excellent growth-promoting effect on tilapia. The FBW, WGR, and SGR values of tilapia juveniles fed with PSP-SeNPs supplemented diets (0.5-4.5 mg/kg) were significantly higher than those of the control (P< 0.05). A weight gain rate of 4.1%-43.4% and specific growth rate of 0.15%-1.74% were obtained in tilapia during 45-day feeding. CONCLUSIONS The use of marine viscera polysaccharides is a promising, green method for the synthesis of selenium nanoparticles. There are good opportunities for the application of the synthesized PSP-SeNPs in the life sciences. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry",10.1002/jsfa.10656

Shells were infested mainly by introduced Boccardia proboscidea. Polydora hoplura and Dipolydora capensis were also present but in numbers too few to identify factors influencing infestation. At both farms, B. proboscidea lived for a minimum of 12 months. Growth rate, size at maturity, maximum size, infestation intensity, recruitment, percentage of the population brooding and mortality appear to be affected by abalone feeding regime and water temperature, and these factors need to be considered in controlling infestation. Brooders and recruits were present throughout the year, but increased significantly during mid- to late winter/early spring when water temperature and day length increased. Treatment measures should therefore be implemented throughout the year but with increased effort when water temperature increases.",10.2989/AJMS.2007.29.3.16.346

For these concentrations, no mortalities were observed. Growth and feeding rates were measured and compared to controls. The safe levels (no influence on growth) were determined for each compound: 1 mg N-NH3-4 l(-1) (0.045 mg N-NH3 l(-1)) for both abalone and urchin; 1-2 mg N-NO2 l(-1) for the urchin, whereas abalone growth was stimulated at 2 mg N-NO2 l(-1) and its safe level was greater than 5 mg N-NO2 l(-1). For nitrates, the safe level was 100 mg N l(-1) for the urchin and within the range 100-250 mg N l(-1) for abalone. Below this level, nitrates seemed to have a stimulating effect on abalone. Thus, urchins are more sensitive to inorganic nitrogen than abalone. These results were compared to existing data, particularly on shrimp and Salmonidae.

However, the regulations of arginine on the TOR signaling pathway in abalone are still unclear. In this study, slc38a9 of abalone was cloned, and the slc38a9 was knocked down and overexpressed to explore its function in the regulation of the TOR signaling pathway. The results showed that knockdown of slc38a9 decreased the expression of tor, ribosomal s6 protein kinase (s6k) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e (eif4e) and inhibited the activation of the TOR signaling pathway by arginine. Overexpression of slc38a9 up-regulated the expression of TOR-related genes. In addition, hemocytes of abalone were treated with 0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mmol/L of arginine, and abalones were fed diets with 1.17%, 1.68% and 3.43% of arginine, respectively, for 120 days. Supplementation of arginine (0.5-4 mmol/L) increased the expressions of slc38a9, tor, s6k and eif4e in hemocytes, and abalone fed with 1.68% of dietary arginine showed higher mRNA levels of slc38a9, tor, s6k and eif4e and phosphorylation levels of TOR, S6 and 4E-BP.

A novel non-destructive method of digital shell color analysis to reveal the diets of European abalone (ormer) was developed in this study. The method was calibrated using ormers reared under experimental conditions in North Western Brittany in 2012 and fed a controlled monospecific diet to define the shell hues associated with various macroalgae (i.e., Rhodophyta, Chlorophyta, and Phaeophyta). General food preferences were established by comparing the shell hue of wild adult ormers and experimental adult ormers. Shell hue corresponds to the color tint in the HSL color space measured on digital pictures of the shell. Experimentally, shell hue values differed according to treatment, with the most yellow-green hue (72 degrees) for ormers fed Saccharina sp. and the coral hue (25 degrees) for ormers fed Palmaria palmata. High variation in shell color of wild ormers was observed according to the sampling site and/or ontogeny. The diet of wild ormers may be related to the abundance of different drifting algae in their respective habitats.

However, in the present study, the full-length CDs (Coding sequence) of L-gulonolactone oxidase (GLO) from Pacific abalone ( Haliotis discus hannai Ino) were obtained through molecular cloning. The Pacific abalone GLO contained a FAD-binding domain in the N-termination, and ALO domain and conserved HWAK motif in the C-termination. The GLO gene possesses 12 exons and 11 introns. The Pacific abalone GLO was expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, digestive gland, gill, intestine, muscle and mantle. The GLO activity assay revealed that GLO activity was only detected in the kidney of Pacific abalone. After a 100 -day feeding trial, dietary AA levels did not significantly affect the survival, weight gain, daily increment in shell length, and feed conversion ratio of Pacific abalone. The expression of GLO in the kidney was downregulated by dietary AA. These results implied that the ability to synthesize AA in abalone had not been lost. From the evolutionary perspective, the loss of GLO occurred independently as an independent event by matching with the genomes of various species. The positive selection analysis revealed that the GLO gene underwent purifying selective pressure during its evolution.

"Lord, JP; Barry, JP; Graves, D",Impact of climate change on direct and indirect species interactions,2017,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,571,,1,11,,"Recent marine climate change re search has largely focused on the response of individual species to environmental changes in cluding warming and acidification. The response of communities, driven by the direct effects of ocean change on individual species as well the cascade of indirect effects, has received far less study. We used several rocky intertidal species including crabs, whelks, juvenile abalone, and mussels to determine how feeding, growth, and interactions between species could be shifted by changing ocean conditions. Our 10 wk experiment revealed many complex outcomes which highlight the unpredictability of community-level responses. Contrary to our predictions, the largest impact of elevated CO2 was reduced crab feeding and survival, with a pH drop of 0.3 units. Surprisingly, whelks showed no response to higher temperatures or CO2 levels, while abalone shells grew 40 % less under high CO2 conditions. Massive non-consumptive effects of crabs on whelks showed how important indirect effects can be in deter mining climate change responses. Predictions of species outcomes that account solely for physiological responses to climate change do not consider the potentially large role of indirect effects due to species interactions. For strongly linked species (e.g. predator-prey or competitor relationships), the indirect effects of climate change are much less known than direct effects, but may be far more powerful in reshaping future marine communities.",10.3354/meps12148

In an initial experiment conducted for 8 wk, shrimp were proffered a full or reduced ration (100%, 60%, and 20%) of commercial shrimp feed with or without access to sea urchin egesta serving as a source of supplemental nutrients and presumptive probiotics. Individual weight gain of shrimp provided sea urchin egesta only (10.37 +/- 0.35 g) did not differ significantly from that of shrimp proffered a full ration of feed (9.46 +/- 0.39 g) despite significant compositional differences. Consumption of sea urchin egesta combined with commercial shrimp feed resulted in significantly greater weight gain of shrimp when compared with shrimp proffered the same level of commercial shrimp feed only. The largest weight gains of shrimp were found for those groups fed rations of 60% and 100% and had access to egesta (14.09 +/- 0.75 g and 14.72 +/- 0.68 g, respectively). In the next experiment, shrimp were stocked at different densities (approximately 23, 45, 68, and 90 individuals m-2) and were not proffered feed directly. All replicates were provided access to fresh sea urchin egesta produced by four urchins that were fed at a daily rate of 3% of the total initial group weight (140.4 +/- 0.7 g) for 8 wk. The largest individual weight gain was found in the lowest density treatment (6.55 +/- 0.38 g). Harvested biomass significantly increased as density increased, except for the highest density treatment. These results indicate that sea urchin egesta may provide some growth enhancement factor(s) to shrimp when proffered in conjunction with a commercial diet, and at a certain density of shrimp sea urchin egesta may actually serve as a nutritionally complete diet.",10.2983/035.042.0310

The goals were to achieve nutrient recycling, reduced water use, reduced nutrient discharge and high yields. Effluents from Japanese abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) culture tanks drained into a pellet-fed fish (Sparus aurata) culture tank. The fish effluent drained into macroalgal (Ulva lactuca or Gracilaria conferta) culture, and biofilter tanks. Algal production fed the abalone. The system was monitored to assess productivity and nitrogen partitioning over a year. The fish grew at 0.67% day(-1), yielding 28-kg m(-2) year(-1) The nutrients excreted by the fish supported high yields of U. lactuca (78-kg m(-2) year(-1)) and efficient (80%) ammonia filtration. Gracilaria functioned poorly. Ulva supported an abalone growth rate of 0.9% day(-1) and a length increase of 40-66 mu m day(-1) in juveniles, and 0.34% day(-1) and 59 mu m day(-1) in young adults. Total abalone yield was 9.4 kg year(-1). A surplus of seaweed was created in the system. Ammonia-N, as a fraction of total feed-N was reduced from 45% in the fish effluents to 10% in the post-seaweed discharge.

However. strong inferences about these processes can be drawn from other molluscs. For example, ganglia from the gastropods Aplysia and Lymnaea are known to produce neuropeptides related to growth, feeding behavior, and reproduction. Here, we use suppression subtractive hybridization to identify expressed genes that may be linked to the control of growth and feeding in the tropical abalone Haliotis asinina. Two pools of suppression subtractive hybridization clones were obtained from messenger RNA derived from H. asinina cerebral and pleuropedal ganglia, corresponding to genes differentially expressed in (1) well-nourished animals relative to food-deprived ones and (2) well-nourished animals relative to reproductively active ones. From these subtractions, respectively, 204 and 214 unigenes were identified in 222 and 231 sequenced clones, with IS of these unigenes common to both subtractions. A subset of the putative differentially expressed genes was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, validating this approach. The transcripts that are differentially expressed in the ganglia of growing H. asinina fall into a wide range of functional categories, including biological regulation, cell proliferation, and metabolic process, and include genes encoding Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2 (or, FM R Famide), myomodulin, CDC123, RAB37, and dermatopontin.",10.2983/035.029.0328

However, the misuse and overuse of antibiotics have led to the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes in marine aquacultural settings and adjacent coastal environments. Bacterial pathogens may also acquire antibiotic resistance via gene mutations and horizontal gene transfers in such environments, making bacterial infectious diseases extremely difficult or even impossible to treat using conventional antibiotic-based therapies. Consequently, phage therapy has received increasing attention in recent years. This study describes the characterization of phage vB_VnaS-L3 from Vibrio natriegens, and explores its potential application as a biocontrol agent to replace antibiotics against pathogenic V. natriegens in juvenile Pacific abalones aquaculture. Our findings showed that phage vB_VnaS-L3 could be a potential alternate biocontrol and prophylactic agent that could effectively inhibit the growth of pathogenic V. natriegens, significantly reduce the mortality of juvenile abalones, and maintain abalone feeding capacity. Phage-based pathogen control (i.e., phage therapy) has received increasing scientific attention to reduce and prevent the emergence, transmission, and detrimental effects of antibiotic resistance. In the current study, multidrug-resistant Vibrio natriegens strain AbY-1805 was isolated and tentatively identified as a pathogen causing the death of juvenile Pacific abalones (Haliotis discus hannai Ino). In order to apply phage therapy, instead of antibiotics, to treat and control V. natriegens infections in marine aquaculture environments, a lytic phage, vB_VnaS-L3, was isolated. It could effectively infect V. natriegens AbY-1805 with a short latent period (40 min) and high burst size (similar to 890 PFU/cell). Treatment with vB_VnaS-L3 significantly reduced the mortality of juvenile abalones and maintained abalone feeding capacity over a 40-day V. natriegens challenge experiment. Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses suggested that vB_VnaS-L3 was a novel marine Siphoviridae-family phage. Furthermore, vB_VnaS-L3 had a narrow host range, possibly specific to the pathogenic V. natriegens strains. It also exhibited viability at a wide range of pH, temperature, and salinity. The short latent period, large burst size, high host specificity, and broad environmental adaptation suggest that phage vB_VnaS-L3 could potentially be developed as an alternative antimicrobial for the control and prevention of marine animal infections caused by pathogenic V. natriegens.",10.3390/biology11111670

However, the resistance of marine animals to pathogens while under the influence of noise is a topic that has received little attention. To assess the immune defense response of sea slugs against pathogens when exposed to low frequency noise, we performed 120 h exposure experiments on sea slugs after a Vibrio parahaemolyticus application in low frequency noise at 500 Hz and 1000 Hz. We found that after the infection with V. parahaemolyticus, the survival rate of the sea slugs decreased, the apoptosis rate and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production of hemocytes increased significantly (P < 0.05), the proliferation of hemocytes accelerated, the activities of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), alanine transaminase (ALT) and lysozyme (LZM) in the hepatopancreas increased significantly, and the expression of TNF signaling pathway-related genes (TNF-a, FADD, Caspase 8, Caspase 3) and Hsp70 genes were generally upregulated. In addition, exposure of sea slug after infected with V. parahaemolyticus to low frequency noise resulted in a significant increase in both antioxidant and immune parameters, which were positively correlated with frequency. The results showed that noise frequency and exposure time had an interactive effect on the above indicators. In summary, low-frequency noise exposure increases the risk of pathogenic infections in sea slugs and exacerbates the negative effects on the antioxidant capacity and immune metabolism of the organism.",10.1016/j.fsi.2022.05.045

After the experiment, fish were weighed and sampled to obtain haemolymph, brain, and hepatopancreas tissues, which were used to analyze biochemical parameters and gene expression. The findings indicated that the group exposed to blue light demonstrated substantially elevated feeding rate, weight gain, specific growth rate, and reduced feed conversion ratios and visceral-somatic indexes compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). The blue light and full spectrum groups had considerably increased levels of digestive, metabolic, and antioxidant enzyme activity compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). The expression levels of GH, GHR, PACA, ADCY, IGF-I, IGF-IR, and IGFBP growth axis genes in the brain and liver were significantly higher in the blue light group than in the other groups (p < 0.05). The results indicate that spectral impact the growth, feeding rate, digestion, and metabolism of P. leopardus.

Therefore, understanding the adaptation mechanisms of fish to high temperatures is essential for mitigating the negative impacts of thermal stress on aquaculture productivity and fish health. In this study, Paralichthys olivaceus were subjected to high temperatures following pre-heating to evaluate the advantages of pre-stimulation prior to exposure to the critical temperature. The P. olivaceus were exposed to four groups; Acute (subjected to acute heat shock at 32 degrees C), AH-S (exposed to acquired heat shock at 28 degrees C followed by short recovery of 2 h and subsequent heat shock at 32 degrees C), AH-L (exposed to acquired heat shock at 28 degrees C followed by long recovery of days and subsequent heat shock at 32 degrees C) and AH-SL (combined of AH-S and AH-L protocols). In terms of antioxidant response, mRNA expression (caspase 10, thioredoxin (Trx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxiredoxin (Prx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and transferrin (TF)) and enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, and GST) were significantly upregulated in P. olivaceus pre-heated prior to high-temperature exposure (AH-S, AH-L, and AH-SL groups).

Abalone exhibited seasonal variations in field activity with 20% of all individuals observed crawling during June to October, compared with <5% during December to February. In the laboratory, abalone exhibited diurnal as well as seasonal variation in activity. The laboratory activity budget showed that an average abalone spends 9.8 h day(-1) quiescent, 12.0 h day(-1) alert, 0.7 h day(-1) feeding, and 1.5 h day(-1) crawling during the summer, and 15.8 h day(-1) quiescent, 5.5 h day(-1) alert, 2.3 h day(-1) feeding, and 0.4 h day(-1) crawling during the winter.

In order to determine the suitable culture conditions for this species, the present study addressed the effect of diet and water quality on the energetic physiology of C. pica. Experimental animals were fed with different diets (fresh seaweed, benthic microalgae and artificial biofilm), and exposed to different rates of water renewal (10, 50, 100 and 300% h(-1)), and levels of salinity (25, 30, 35 and 40 ppt), temperature (22, 27 and 32 degrees C) and ammonia concentration (2.5, 8.0, 20.0 and 40.0 mu g NH3N L-1). Under such conditions, individual measurements of ingestion rate (IR), absorption efficiency (AE), oxygen consumption rate (OCR), ammonium excretion rate (UR), mucus production rate (MR) and scope for growth (SFG), were conducted. Both, juveniles and adults exhibited a micro-grazing feeding behavior. IR was affected by diet, water renewal and salinity, while AE was influenced by all the factors tested. OCR was only affected by ammonia concentration, while UR was influenced by salinity, temperature and ammonia concentration. Finally, MR was affected by all the factors tested, except for diet.

The presence of insulin and insulinrelated peptides are found among animals. In Mollusca, molluscan insulin-related peptides (MIPs) are involved in their body and shell growth. Hence, this study aimed to understand if there was difference in these peptide levels of fast and slow growing Pacific abalones, Haliotis discus hannai. To this end, four abalone insulin-related peptides (AIPs) are mined from cerebral ganglia transcriptomes of fast-growing and slow-growing abalones: AIP1,-2,-3 and-6. Notably, these AIPs possess 8 cysteine residues in their predicted insulin A and B chains, potentially supporting four disulfide bridges. Further sequence analysis based on the phylogenetic tree and multiple alignment methods indicated that AIPs have sequence features that are conserved among MIPs in many gastropods. The tissue distributions of four AIPs showed ubiquitous and similar expression in the following tissues including the cerebral ganglion, hepatopancreas, gonad, and mantle of both genders. However, there is some difference in other tissue distribution. Since the food consumption is intimately associated with the hemolymph glucose and animal growth, relative AIP1,-2,-3 and -6 expression levels in the cerebral ganglion were measured following seaweed supplementation. The animals fed with brown seaweed showed increased these AIPs by 1.6-4.7 folds from 3 h after feeding, which lasting to 12 h, coinciding with the peak of hemolymph glucose.

The potential algae requirements and consumable costs for each propagation method were determined, using experimental data and values from the literature, to assess the viability of utilizing each of these propagation methods in a commercial abalone nursery. The use of red algal spores required 592-52,000 kg of algae, depending on the level of spore release and the percentage of fertile algal thalli collected.

The open reading frame (ORF) of AbTLR is 3804 bp in length and encodes a 1268 amino acid peptide with a calculated molecular mass of 143.5 kDa. The deduced protein shows typical TLR domain architecture, with leucine rich repeats (LRR) and the toll-interleukin receptor (TIR) domain. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close evolutionary relationship for AbTLR to its invertebrate counterparts, with close clustering to the molluscan homologs. Quantitative real-time PCR detected ubiquitous transcription of AbTLR in healthy tissues, but with highest levels in hemocytes. Differential transcriptional modulation of AbTLR was observed in abalone hemocytes and gills upon immune challenge, whereby Vibrio parahaemolyticus and purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced the transcript level prominently.

Prior to closure, harvests of the main species that compose the fishery (the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens Swainson 1822; the green abalone, Haliotis fulgens Philippi 1845; and the pink abalone, Haliotis corrugata Gray 1828) had plummeted to an all-time low of several hundred thousand pounds per year. Overfishing and several diseases identified recently in abalone are creating concern within the industry with respect to the recovery of the fishery. One method being considered to restore the fishery on a limited basis is reseeding. Reseeding success is dependent on many factors. including planting location and techniques of seed placement. Other important factors include the abundance and nutritive quality of macroalgae (kelp) available to the abalone, the seawater temperature requirement of the species being seeded, the size of the seed being planted, and the presence of potential predators within the seed site. In this study, we observed that shell growth and weight gain in juvenile red and green abalone are temperature-dependent. When constant, elevated temperatures are maintained, growth rates improved as compared to growth rates in animals kept at the lower temperatures normally found. More growth in juvenile red abalone was observed at 19 degrees C, with an average daily shell growth of 0.1 mm/day. Previous work suggested that Egregia laevigata, a brown kelp was a superior food source for juvenile abalone; however, the growth rates of I rd abalone fed Egregia increased minimally compared to growth rates of juvenile red abalone fed another brown kelp Macrocystis pyrifera.

Extrapolations of these growth rates for an entire year indicate growth of 36 mm/y for red abalone and 60 mm/y for green abalone, Growth predictions based on laboratory-reared juveniles will vary from those observed in wild populations since seawater temperatures are not static along the coast and may vary as much as 10-12 degrees C during the year. The nutritional value of kelp and other algae may be as important as temperature in the effect on growth observed in the laboratory and in the field. Increased growth rates exhibited by juvenile red abalone during the period from January through April 1977 may be reflective of changing nutrient ratios or levels in kelp that are otherwise limiting during reduced or non-upwelling months. We are presently culturing hatchery-produced red and green abalone seed for eventual planting in the U.S, Department of the Interior's Cabrillo National Monument. The seed are approximately 45 mm in size and are fed a mixed kelp diet. They will be transplanted when they are approximately 75-100 mm in size. Reseeding success assessed by annual dive surveys should help determine if planting larger animals increases survival of brood stock and increases recruitment within the monument area.",
"Hirayama, K; Gillette, R",A Neuronal Network Switch for Approach/Avoidance Toggled by Appetitive State,2012,CURRENT BIOLOGY,22,2,118,123,,"Concrete examples of computation and implementation of cost/benefit decisions at the level of neuronal circuits are largely lacking. Such decisions are based on appetitive state, which is the integration of sensation, internal state, and memory. Value-based decisions are accessible in neuronal circuitry of simple systems [1]. In one such system, the predatory sea slug Pleurobranchaea, appetite is readily quantified in behavior [2] and related to approach/avoidance decision [3]. Moreover, motor aspects of feeding and turning can be observed as fictive motor output in the isolated central nervous system (CNS) [4, 5]. Here we found that the excitation state of the feeding motor network both manifested appetitive state and controlled expression of orienting versus avoidance. In isolated CNSs, spontaneous feeding network activity varied proportionally to donor feeding thresholds. CNSs from low- and high-feeding-threshold donors expressed fictive orienting or avoidance, respectively, in response to brief stimulation of sensory nerves. Artificially exciting the feeding network converted fictive avoidance to orienting. Thus, the feeding network embodied appetitive state and toggled approach/avoidance decision by configuring response symmetry of the premotor turn network. A resulting model suggests a basic cost/benefit decision module from which to consider evolutionary elaboration of the circuitry to serve more intricate valuation processes in complex animals.",10.1016/j.cub.2011.10.055

Postlarvae (3-7 per dish) were allowed to graze for two to three hours and video recordings were taken to estimate postlarval size and grazing rates by digital image analysis. Seawater was changed every other day and postlarvae were measured again after six to eight days to estimate growth. Grazing and growth rates of postlarvae older than 15 days increased linearly with biofilm density, The highest grazing rates for seven and 60 day-old abalone were 79 and 10,999 cells/postlarva/hour, respectively. The most important increase in grazing activity occurred between ages 45 and 60 days when postlarvae reached 1.5-2.0 mm and started the formation of the first respiratory pore.

Abalone were fed five different experimental diets in which FO (control diet) was serially replaced by 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% FlaxO respectively. RESULTS: Muscle, gonad and digestive gland of abalone fed the control diet and the diets containing 25%, 50% and 75% FlaxO showedsignificantlyhigher (P < 0.05) levels of eicosapentaenoicacid (EPA), docosapentaenoicacid (DPA) anddocosahexaenoic acid (DHA) compared to those fed the 100% FlaxO. The results also showed that Delta-6 desaturase and elongase gene expression in muscle was increased in a graded manner by increasing dietary FlaxO. The expression of both genes was higher in abalone fed the FlaxO- substituted diets compared to the abalone fed FO. CONCLUSION: The replacement of FOwith FlaxO in commercial abalone diets at levels of 25- 75% can improve the composition of health- benefiting n- 3 polyunsturated fatty acids in tissues of cultured hybrid abalone, and achieve similar outcomes to FO supplementation.

To counter grazing effects, constitutive and induced anti-herbivory responses evolved in seaweeds. Feeding-assayed induction experiments were conducted in the laboratory to investigate whether 14 d grazing periods by either the periwinkle Littorina brevicula or the abalone Haliotis discus induced anti-herbivory defences in the green alga Ulva pertusa and the brown alga Laminaria japonica. Where appropriate, assays were repeated with artificial food containing lipophilic algal extracts, using dichloromethane (DCM) as a solvent, to test whether or not snails induced chemical defences. While exposure to periwinkles reduced palatability of fresh L. japonica pieces for naive conspecific grazers, no such effect was displayed by abalone-exposed L. japonica pieces. Patterns of grazer specificity in the palatability of fresh algae were not confirmed when using artificial food containing algal DCM extracts. This suggests that L. japonica either induced morphological defences or periwinkle-deterrent substances originated from the non-lipophilic fraction of defensive chemicals. Grazer-specific induced responses were not apparent in U. pertusa assays. This study revealed that the induction of chemical anti-herbivory responses depends not only on the type of grazer but also on the type of alga on which the grazer feeds.",10.3354/meps07255

Federal Endangered Species Act-listed white abalone (Haliotis sorenseni) in California, USA depends on the success of a captive breeding program, which requires collection of wild broodstock to maintain genetic diversity. Foot damage is frequently sustained during collection and handling, and severe injuries can be fatal. This study used the proxy species red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) to investigate the ability of abalone to survive foot injury by administering foot injuries varying in severity and monitoring subsequent health and survival. In a preliminary study, 6/6 farm-origin 55-70 mm animals survived two types of injury while 5/6 survived a third type of injury. We then conducted a definitive study using 24 wild-origin animals (165-207 mm) and three intensified injury treatments. Five of six animals that received a deep tissue incision were dead the following morning, presumably from acute hemolymph loss, and the remaining animal in that treatment group died on day 41 with a systemic bacterial infection. Nine of twelve abalone that received loss of either 8% or 17% of foot sole epithelium survived until experiment termination at day 90, at which time all survivors were regenerating epithelial tissues, as evident by histology. This study suggests that abalone may be more capable of surviving significant superficial foot damage that can occur during collection and handling, at least in a captive rearing environment, than has been previously recognized.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735734

The Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai, is a nocturnal animal that avoids strong light and prefers darkness. Previous research showed that the abalone mortality rate under short-wavelength blue light was remarkably greater than that under darkness, natural light and orange light. In this study, the temporal variations in the dopamine content of abalone hemolymph under various light condi-tions were compared, and the dopamine content after exposure to blue light for 6 h was remarkably higher than that in any other group. The full-length monoamine oxidase (MAO) gene sequence for the catecholamine metabolism-related MAO enzyme was obtained by cloning. This gene encoded 545 amino acids, in which the predicted sequence contained a domain that was characteristic for monoamino oxidase. The MAO expression levels were highest in the hepatopancreas and in situ hybridization further revealed that MAO was widely localized around the hepatic nerve cord. The in vitro recombinant MAO protein could catalyze the degradation of epinephrine and dopamine. After 3 h exposure to blue light, the expression levels of MAO, Mn-superoxide dis-mutase (Mn-SOD), and catalase (CAT) genes were remarkably greater than those in any other group, but the lysozyme (LYZ) and sigma-glutathione-s-transferase (GSTs) expression levels began to increase at 12 h and 6 h, respectively. After the MAO expression levels were knocked-down by RNAi technology, the dopamine concen-tration significantly increased, but the phagocytic activity, nitric oxide concentration, and the Mn-SOD, CAT, GSTs and LYZ expression levels were remarakbly lower than in the control group and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) group, suggesting that the normal dopamine metabolism process played a vital role in maintaining the immune response. The above results show that monoamine oxidase may act as an immuno-modulator in abalone when responding to adverse light conditions. These results could also be useful when drawing up conservation measures for preserving nearshore benthic biodiversity, such as optimizing urban night lighting schemes.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739726

The growth rates and Se contents increased significantly in abalones fed with Se-enriched G. lemaneiformis, while the toxicity of Cd was reduced. Seven to 12 days Cd exposure to the Se-enriched G. lemaneiformis not only affected GPx activity but the MT levels fluctuated irregularly. MT concentrations increased after 3 days exposure and then gradually decreased to the control level after Day 7. There were statistically significant positive correlations between MT levels, GPx activity and Se concentrations, and negative relationships between MT levels, GPx activity and Cd levels in abalones. These findings suggest that Se-enriched Gracilaria protects abalone against Cd toxicity.

A natural pigment in the algal diet, Palmaria palmata, served as an indicator to determine the digestive status of the abalone. The changing concentration of the pigment in the viscera indicates that very active digestion took place during the first 10 h and that the total food passage time was about 44 h for the abalone after a meal at 15 degrees C water temperature. Visceral FAA levels were examined at 0, 4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 36, 44, 52, 62, 72, and 96 h after a meal. The mean level of free essential amino acids (FEAA) attained an obvious peak at 4 h. It increased gradually from 4 to 36 h and then maintained at a relatively constant level till 96 h postfeeding. The mean level of free nonessential amino acids (FNEAA) had a pattern of postprandial change similar to that of FEAA.

Overfishing not only affects the targeted species, but also potentially influences the integrity and functioning of the ecosystem through associated changes in community composition. We assessed the herbivorous effects of H. midae on the benthos through a 6-month field experiment involving exclusion/inclusion plots. This showed that benthic community composition remained largely unchanged whether H. midae was present or absent and specifically revealed no evidence that H. midae diminishes algal biomass, probably because in the region where we worked, it feeds mainly by trapping drift kelp rather than grazing on attached algae. The absence of responses to the removal of abalone was additionally evident in comparison with indices of abundance and diversity, functional groups and individual species. In the absence of abalone, there were subtle increases in the green alga Codium stephensiae and the crustose brown alga Zeacarpa leiomorpha and decreases in the four species of foliose macroalgae, but none of these effects were significant. The presence of H. midae thus had no negative grazing effects on any elements of the epilithic community composition.

To find microbial indicators associated with faster abalone growth and hence the economics of abalone aquaculture, we performed a metabarcoding analysis of the intes-tinal microbial community in Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) with different growth rates. Two groups of Pacific abalone of different sizes were selected from a population that originated from the same fertilization batch grown in indoor tanks for 750 days post-fertilization: small (S; 4.24 ? 1.89 g; n = 8) and large (L; 24.47 ? 4.65 g; n = 8). We then performed DNA isolation using intestines dissected from the Pacific abalone in both groups, followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 16S rRNA gene. Overall, an average of 75,643 reads, of which 415.8?424.9 bp were obtained via Illumina MiSeq analysis. Taxonomic classification of the 16S rRNA gene identified up to 1032 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) per group and more than 807 microbial genera were detected at least twice from all intestinal metabarcoding DNA samples analyzed. Principal coordinate analysis indicated that there was a clear distinction between groups. The most dominant genus among the intestinal samples in both size groups was Mycoplasma, followed by Psychrilyobacter, Vibrio, and Algibacter. The microbial genus that were more prevalent in large than small abalone were Mycoplasma (32.3635 ? 4.356%), followed by Psychrilyobacter (17.305 ? 8.179) and unclassified species belonging to Mycoplasmataceae (2.930 ? 0.794%), and Rhodospirillaceae (2.555 ? 0.486%).

Species introductions and climate-driven range shifts alter the quantity and quality of these subsidies in donor habitats, thereby potentially influencing recipient communities. Such impacts might be particularly important when detrital shifts alter detritivore feeding and performance. Attempts to identify a general theory predicting the consequences of invasive species on detritivores have been challenging, in part because most theories have been based on the study of microbes or consumers of living prey. Further, two recent meta-analyses disagree about the impacts of invasive plants on detritivore populations. Here, we examined the potential impact of a human-mediated shift in macroalgal detrital subsidy from native giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) to invasive devilweed (Sargassum horneri) on recipient rocky shores, with an emphasis on exploring species-specific impacts. We assessed consumer performance on single species diets or on a mixture in no-choice assays, and we assessed feeding preference in choice assays. Additionally, we examined the impacts of this shift on grazing of native benthic seaweeds by an intertidal consumer assemblage. Replacing native Macrocystis with invasive Sargassum had consumer-specific impacts on performance-suppressing growth of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) but enhancing growth of black turban snails (Tegula funebralis). The effect of mixed diets on consumer growth also displayed consumer specificity. Also, replacing Macrocystis with invasive Sargassum increased grazing of native benthic seaweeds by a realistic detritivore assemblage, but only on the habitat-forming brown seaweed, Silvetia compressa. Thus, invasion-mediated changes in detrital wrack composition had consumer- and seaweed-specific impacts. Such species specificity could underlie disagreements about the impact of species invasions on detritivore populations and could impede our ability to identify a general theory about how species invasions will impact recipient communities via detrital pathways.",10.1002/ecs2.70165

Relying on coastal waters, the aquaculture area has suffered ecological and economic losses caused by hypoxia, especially in summer. In this study, to investigate the stress resistance of the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai (DD) and the hybrid H. discus hannai female x H. fulgens male (DF), a combination of physiological, biochemical, and metabolomic methods were used to compare the metabolic responses of these two abalones to acute hypoxia (similar to 0.5mg O-2/L, 12 h) and reoxygenation (similar to 6.6mg O-2/L, 10-20 h). Hemolymph characteristics and aerobic/anaerobic respiratory capacity changed significantly under hypoxia or reoxygenation conditions, and they were regulated in different trends in two abalones. The contents of hepatopancreas glycogen in two abalones reached the trough after 10 h recovery, implying that short-term hypoxia leads to a long-lasting (several hours) imprint on the energy storage of abalone. In response to dissolved oxygen fluctuation, metabolic profiles of two abalones changed in distinct ways both in the hypoxia group or the reoxygenation group. The conversion of carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism indicated that hypoxia prompts abalone to change the way of energy metabolism, which may also reflect the difference in the energy utilization of DD and DF abalones. In addition, 3 metabolites (L-glutamate, 2-hydroxy-butanoic acid, and 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid) as potential biomarkers for hypoxia and reoxygenation response in abalone were determined by operating characteristic analysis (ROC). Overall, this study provides information towards understanding the damage caused by frequent hypoxic events and implies the metabolic shifts that occur under hypoxia and reoxygenation conditions in DD and DF abalones.

The mortality in the high-concentration group increased throughout the experimental period, and, ultimately, only 24% of the sea urchins survived. Compared to the control. gonad growth was significantly reduced at UIA concentrations above 0.016 mg 1(-1). Sea urchins from the exposed groups did not display a significant reduction in feed intake compared to the control. which suggests that the gonad growth reduction could not be attributed to a decreased feed intake. The present study demonstrates that adult green sea urchins show low tolerance to ambient unionised ammonia and are unable to maintain high gonad growth facing such conditions. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

HINT plays an important role in many biological processes especially in cell biology, and it has been found in a wide variety of species. However, the functional attributes of HINT homologues in invertebrates have not yet been reported. Here we identified a HINT homologue in abalone, which we named ab-HINT. The ab-HINT shows significant structural and functional similarities to mammalian HINT. RT-PCR and western blot analysis show that ab-HINT is ubiquitously expressed in abalone tissues and highly expressed in hemocyte and gills. In addition, significant up-regulation of ab-HINT was observed after LPS or Poly I:C challenge. Immunostainings suggest that ab-HINT is expressed predominantly in epithelial cells and mainly localized in the cytoplasmic compartment. Studies of the effect on cell apoptosis indicate that ab-HINT can trigger hemocytes apoptosis and p53 is involved in this process. These results conclude that ab-HINT is involved in the immune response of abalone and may be a potential pro-apoptotic factor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first identification and characterization of a HINT homologue in invertebrates. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.dci.2009.08.008

For nursery culture, early juvenile abalone with mean shell length (SL) of 1.30 +/- 0.006 cm and mean body weight (BW) of 0.45 +/- 0.007 g were stocked in the containers at 100 ind m(-2) and reared until they attained the 3 cm SL size required for grow-out culture in three of the four culture containers. For grow-out culture, juvenile abalone harvested from nursery culture with mean SL of 3.23 +/- 0.018 cm and mean BW of 7.33 +/- 0.131 g were stocked in the containers at 50 ind m(-2) and reared until they were harvestable at 5 cm SL cocktail size in three of the four culture containers. The 3 cm SL grow-out size was attained at 90 days of culture (DOC) in recycled containers, trays, and tubes, while the 5 cm SL cocktail size at 180 DOC in the same containers. Abalone reared in tubes had the highest mean SL after 90 DOC in nursery culture (3.21 cm), while those in trays after 180 DOC in grow-out culture (5.30 cm). However, at the end of the nursery and grow-out culture, there were no significant differences in mean SL among the abalone reared in these three culture containers. In both culture phases, abalone reared in cages had the lowest mean SL, 2.88 and 4.44 cm, respectively. Survival was highest in trays (98.64%) during nursery culture and in tubes (96.57%) during grow-out culture. With comparable results in recycled containers, trays, and tubes for both growth and survival at the nursery and grow-out phases, tubes are recommended for use when culture is to be done on reef flats. Tubes are the most stable and durable among the four culture containers tested.

However, this association leads to continuous oxidation of the galvanic anode and therefore to a release of a metal cocktail in the forms of ions or oxy-hydroxides. Therefore, the main objective of our study was to investigate the toxicity of elements released from the dissolution of an aluminium-based galvanic anode (similar to 95% Al, similar to 5% Zn, <0.1% for In, Cu, Cd, Mn, Fe) on a grazing gastropod, the abalone Haliotis tuberculata.

We assessed histopathological changes in H. laevigata gills held in control (22 degrees C) or elevated (25 degrees C) water temperature conditions for 47 d by developing a new scoring protocol that incorporates histopathological descriptions and relative score summary. Lesions were allocated to 1 of 3 reaction patterns, (1) epithelial, (2) circulatory or (3) inflammatory, and scored based on their prevalence in gill leaflets. Indices for each reaction pattern were calculated and combined to provide an overall gill index. H. laevigata held in 25 degrees C water temperature had significantly more epithelial lifting and hemolymph channel enlargement and significantly higher gill and circulatory reaction pattern indices than H. laevigata held in 22 degrees C water temperature. One H. laevigata had a proliferation of unidentified cells in the v-shaped skeletal rod of a gill leaflet. The unidentified cells contained enlarged nuclei, a greater nucleus:cytoplasm ratio and, in some cases, mitotic figures. This cell population could represent a region of hematopoiesis in response to hemocyte loss or migration to a lesion. Without thorough diagnostic testing, the origin of these larger cells cannot be confirmed. The new scoring protocol developed will allow the standard quantification of gill lesions for H. laevigata, specifically for heat-related conditions, and could further be adapted for other Haliotis spp.",10.3354/dao03673

This, in turn, affects the stability of ecological systems and the security of the aquaculture industry. In this study, we investigated the effects of different fasting regimens (GY: fasting at 1-day intervals, GL: fasting at 2-day intervals) on the behavioral and physiological adaptability of Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), a marine gastropod, particularly in response to recurrent marine heat waves. Our findings revealed that the survival rates of abalone in both the GY and GL groups were significantly higher than those in the unfasted control group (ZC) (P < 0.05). Furthermore, behavioral assessments revealed that the cumulative distance moved, feeding durations, and the percentage of cumulative feeding time relative to movement time were significantly greater in the GL group compared to both the ZC and GY groups (P < 0.05). Sequencing of the 16S rDNA amplicon revealed that the intestinal microbial community of abalone in the GL group harbored a higher abundance of beneficial bacteria (Arenimonas, Pseudolabrys) compared to the GY and ZC groups. In contrast, the potentially harmful bacterium Tenacibaculum was significantly reduced in the GY group relative to the ZC group (P < 0.05). A non-targeted metabolomics analysis identified amino acids and fatty acids, such as Citrulline, Leu-Pro, and L-Glutamate, as differential metabolic markers. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the 'Biosynthesis of amino acids' pathway was significantly enriched in both the GY and GL groups compared to the ZC group (P < 0.05). Further analysis of 23 amino acids showed that 15 and 20 amino acids, including glycine and serine, were downregulated in the GY and GL groups, respectively, compared to the ZC group. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between the relative abundance of both Arenimonas and Pseudolabrys in the abalone's gut and citrulline content in the GY and GL groups (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that intermittent fasting not only promotes energy redistribution, serving as an effective strategy for abalone to cope with oceanic heat waves, but also provides valuable insights into the behavioral and physiological plasticity of marine shellfish in response to global climate change.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2025.742367

The artificial Diet E containing fishmeal (20% dry weight), soybean meal (30%) gelatine (15%), whole-meal wheat flour (30%) and agar (5%) was found to have the lowest 16-hour water turbidance. Diet E was further modified to include one of the attractants black pepper (Diet E1), cinnamon (Diet E2), powdered Spirulina sp. (Diet E3) or peanut butter (Diet E4). The feeding attraction of these diets to juvenile Trochus niloticus was tested over the 10-hour afternoon and evening period of maximum feeding activity. Hourly observations were made of the location of each animal. It was found that Diet E3 had the highest positive response index (65% of observations found animals close to the diet). Lower positive responses were recorded to Diet E1 (53%), Diet E2 (51%), Diet E4 (46%) and the control (41%).

The recycled drums were newly tested containers for abalone culture as the cheaper and larger alternative. However, on the 10th month of culture, serpulids (Pomatoceros sp. and Spirorbis sp.) were observed on the abalone shells; hence, the 12-month culture was extended to 16 months to observe further the effects of these ectoparasites on the growth and survival of abalone. Throughout the culture period, abalone reared in tubes had significantly higher mean shell length and body weight than those reared in drums, measuring 45.42 +/- 0.36 mm, 23.40 +/- 0.99 g, and 41.45 +/- 0.23 mm, 18.26 +/- 0.40 g at harvest, respectively. Mean growth rates of those in tubes were significantly higher than those in drums before serpulid infestation but did not differ during months of infestation. Survival was consistently higher in tubes than drums, except during May-September 2023. At harvest, survival in tubes was 46.7 +/- 11.0%, 37.8 +/- 5.9% in drums.

Here, we characterized HIF-1 alpha in Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), an aquaculture-relevant mollusk species, and its transcriptional regulation patterns in response to oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent stimuli were investigated. The molecular cloning and sequence analysis revealed that the abalone HIF-1 alpha shared conversed features in its domain organization such as basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain, Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain, oxygen-dependent degradation domains (ODDDs), and C-terminal transactivation domain (C-TAD) with metazoan orthologs. The abalone HIF-1 alpha was proven to be transcriptionally active in multiple tissues according to dissolved oxygen contents, with the most sensitive responsiveness in the gill. Under non-hypoxic conditions, the tissue-dependent transcriptional regulation patterns of the abalone HIF-1 alpha were closely correlated and intertwined with those of HSP90 and MT in response to thermal challenge and heavy metal exposure, respectively. The abalone HIF-1 alpha expression was significantly modulated under normoxic conditions in response to immune challenges with lipopolysaccharide and Vibrio harveyi with the highest upregulation in the hemocytes. However, the combined treatment of hypoxia and immune stimulation exhibited no synergistic activation for the induction of HIF-1 alpha mRNA. Collectively, dynamic transcriptional regulation of the abalone HIF-1 alpha with the tissue specificity in response to oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent stimulatory challenges suggests that HIF-1 alpha plays crucial roles in interdependent crosstalk between hypoxia, innate immunity, and environmental stresses, which can be a useful basis to investigate cellular and physiological responses of farmed abalones to oxygen depletion and other-related stress factors.",10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.100566

Urchins were fed microalgae (Achnanthes longipes, Cocconeis sublittoralis or Saccharina longissima gametophyte), macroalgae (S. longissima sporophyte or Ulva pertusa), or starved, and their growth rate (GR) was examined to identify the size at which sea urchins' diet shifts from microalgae to macroalgae. Changes in specific activity of seven enzymes (amylase, glycogen hydrolase, carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase), laminarinase, alginate lyase, protease and lipase) were investigated in urchins of test diameters (TDs) 1.0-3.5, 3.0-4.5 and 6.0-9.2 mm to elucidate ontogenetic and diet-responsive changes. GRs were generally higher in urchins of < 6 mm TD fed microalgae than in those fed macroalgae. However, GRs of urchins fed macroalgae increased linearly for a TD of a parts per thousand 3 mm to a TD of a parts per thousand 6 mm. Activity for every enzyme was low in urchins < 3 mm in TD. Development of enzyme production capacity and increased ability to regulate enzyme activity in response to ingested diets were observed for urchins > 3 mm in TD. Our results suggest that the primary nutrient source of S. intermedius shifts from microalgae to macroalgae at a parts per thousand 6 mm TD, and that macroalgae digestion efficiency in urchins a parts per thousand yen3 mm TD gradually improves because of activation of the enzymes. Highly activated enzymes enable sea urchins to efficiently digest nutrients stored in the bodies of macroalgae, allowing the primary nutrient source of S. intermedius to shift from microalgae to macroalgae.",10.1007/s00227-015-2630-z

Since the ratio between the two forms of glutathione (GSH/GSSG) is important for the optimal function of GSH to act as an antioxidant against H2O2, the contribution of GSR as an enzymatic regulatory agent to maintain the proper ratio is essential. Abalones are marine mollusks that frequently encounter environmental factors that can trigger the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2. Therefore, we conducted the current study to reveal the molecular and functional properties of a GSR homolog in the disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus. The identified cDNA sequence (2325 bp) has a 1356 bp long open reading frame (ORF), coding for a 909 bp long amino acid sequence, which harbors a pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase domain (171-246 aa), a pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase dimerization domain, and a NAD(P)(+)-binding Rossmann fold superfamily signature domain. Four functional residues: the FAD binding site, glutathione binding site, NADPH binding motif, and assembly domain were identified to be conserved among the other species. The recombinant abalone GSR (rAbGSR) exhibited detectable activity in a standard glutathione reductase activity assay. The optimum pH and optimal temperature for the reaction were found to be 7.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively, while the ionic strength of the medium had no effect. The enzymatic reaction was vastly inhibited by Cu+2 and Cd+2 ions. A considerable effect of cellular protection was detected with a disk diffusion assay conducted with rAbGSR. Moreover, an MIT assay and flow cytometry confirmed the significance of the protective role of rAbGSR in cell function. Furthermore, AbGSR was found to be ubiquitously distributed in different types of abalone tissues. AbGSR mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in response to three immune challenges: Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), thus indicating its possible involvement in host defense mechanisms during pathogenic infections. Taken together, the results of the current study suggest that AbGSR plays an important role in antioxidant-mediated host defense mechanisms and also provide insights into the immunological contribution of AbGSR.

Larvae and early juveniles were fed daily with diatoms, whereas late juveniles and adults were fed with artificial food and the green algae Ulva fasciata. Shell length and total wet weight from 40-80 randomly selected specimens in various experiments were measured monthly, and sex and gonad maturity stage were defined visually. The water parameters in tanks reflected the ambient condition of the Arabian Sea. The growth pattern of the abalone was very similar in the 3 experimental trials. Larvae and early juveniles have very fast growth rates, reaching an average 53-56 mm and 19-25 g after 1 y. Better results were obtained in the second and third experiments, when at the end of 2 y of rearing, abalone mean length was 67-72 mm and the weight was 46-54 g. At the age 3 y, abalone attained a mean length of 83-85 mm and a weight of 89-93 g. After 6 y, the abalone from the first experiment (2001 to 2005) showed, on average, 88.5 mm and 110.9 g. The length increments were the highest during the first year of the culture, whereas weight increments reached maximum values during the third (second and third trials) and fourth year (first trial) of rearing. After 4 y, abalone growth increments in weight decreased significantly. Males generally but not always have larger increments in length and weight when compared with females. During cultivation, a decrease in abalone weight was sometimes observed that, in most cases, coincided with decrease in water temperature during the southwest monsoon period (June to September). Some abalone sexually matured in tanks after 1 y, and mature males and females occurred almost year-round, with peaks in April to May and November to December. The length at first maturity was found to be 65.2 mm for males and 67.1 mm for females. Growth parameters for a von Bertalanffy function were calculated using data from different experiments. The growth rate coefficient in the first experiment was lower (K = 0.65), but in third experiment it appeared higher (K = 0.80) than in natural conditions from data other authors calculated based on length frequency distribution analysis, which indicates faster growth rates of abalone in tanks when compared with those in the wild.

We conducted 2 experiments to assess the effectiveness of different methods of reducing predation on outplanted northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana). During the first experiment, we removed small predators from brick-filled habitat cages that excluded large predators. The survival rates of juvenile abalone (mean shell length (SL), 22 mm) were greater in cages from which sea stars and other predators were removed periodically than in control cages. During the second experiment, we constructed 30 fenced 1-m(2) outplanting plots and assigned 10 randomly to be controls and 20 to be filled with 1 of 4 complex substrates (0.3-m layer of cobbles, 0.3-m layer of boulders, 0.9-m layer of cobbles, and 0.9-m layer of boulders). We then released 30 large juvenile abalone (mean SL, 51.5 mm) into each plot. The number of live outplanted abalone remaining in the complex substrate plots was significantly greater than in the control plots during the first 6 days. Surveys of a 4-m radius around each plot showed that emigration was lower from complex substrate plots than from control plots, and fewer shell fragments were found. The addition of complex substrate to plots provided crypsis from large predators but also resulted in significantly higher densities of small predators. Outplanting lower densities of abalone into larger plots of natural high-substrate complexity might attract fewer predatory sea stars and crabs, and thus result in higher survival rates.",10.2983/035.032.0123

Structural analysis confirmed that Hdh-VDAC2 is a pore-forming /3-barrel protein. Molecular docking further confirmed the protein-protein interactions of Hdh-VDAC2 with Hdh-BAX, Hdh-caspase 3, and Hdh-BCL2. In the Hdh-VDAC2-inhibited hemocytes (HCY), apoptotic genes (Hdh-caspase-3 and Hdh-BAX) exhibited elevated mRNA expression, while the anti-apoptotic gene (Hdh-BCL2) was downregulated. Further, fluorescent techniques confirmed excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lower cell viability, elevated caspase 3 activity, and increased DNA fragmentation in Hdh-VDAC2-inhibited HCY, indicating an antiapoptotic role of Hdh-VDAC2 in Pacific abalone. Transcriptomic analysis revealed differential expression patterns, with upregulation in the digestive gland (DG) and downregulation in the gill (GIL) and HCY when comparing heat-tolerant (HT) versus heat-sensitive (HS) abalone groups. Additionally, both cold and heat stresses induced Hdh-VDAC2 expression. Other environmental factors including H2O2, cadmium, bacteria, and viruses, were also shown to induce Hdh-VDAC2 mRNA expression in the GIL and DG of Pacific abalone. During metamorphosis, the blastula (BLS) stage exhibited higher Hdh-VDAC2 mRNA expression.

The production of these gastropods is limited by the short supply of their food, marine seaweed. At the National Center for Mariculture (NCM) in Eilat (Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea), Israel, we have developed a culture system that can produce marine macroalgivores on large quantities of nutritious seaweed cultured in seawater fishpond effluents. Two valuable species of abalone, Haliotis fulgens from California and Haliotis discus hannai from Japan, have been brought to the NCM as new candidates for intensive culture, in addition to the previously introduced Haliotis tuberculata. Despite the differences between Eilat and their natural habitats in climate and in chemical and physical conditions, both species acclimated and reproduced well in Eilat. Survival of the spat of all species fell to less than 5% by 8 weeks. The surviving spats grew in one year to 31, 14 and 28 mm in H. fulgens, H. discus hannai and H. tuberculata, respectively. Middle-sized animals (19-37 mm) of these three species grew daily 0.21%, 0.17% and 0.23%, respectively, with survival of 99%, 96% and 80%, respectively, and an FCR (food conversion ratio, in g fresh feed consumption/g weight gain) of 14, 22 and 26, respectively. In these growth trials, all size-groups of H. fulgens, like H. tuberculata, grew much faster than reported in the literature. Thus, both of these species seem like good candidates for commercial culture in Israel. On the contrary, H. discus hannai, for as yet unknown reasons, grew slower than in published reports, hence it is not yet ready for commercial culture in Israel.",

To investigate the development of gut microflora in the small abalone Haliotis diversicolor and the effect of various diets on the bacterial communities, we analyzed the composition of gut microbial flora and the bacterial digestive enzymes in connection with four important development stages, i.e., larva, early-juvenile, late-juvenile and grow-out. Among these cultivated bacteria, the Firmicutes group was isolated from both the larval and early-juvenile stages; the CFB (Cytophaga/Flexibacteria/Bacterioides) group was detected in early juveniles, late juveniles and grow-out; the gamma-proteobacteria existed throughout the four development stages. The isolated Bacillus sp. and Pseudoalteromonas sp. dominated in the larvae and were rarely detected in other stages. Subsequently, the genus Vibrio predominated in the latter three phases after the first feeding. Cluster analysis of the DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis) patterns was basically congruent with the result of culture-dependent method in which the gut bacterial community indicated the successional change in the development stages. And the artificial diets contribute to the change of gut bacterial composition to some extent. The enzyme assay showed that the gut bacteria isolated from the early juveniles produced the greatest diverse digestive enzymes compared with those isolated from other development stages. most cultivated bacteria in each development stage showed protease, lipase or alginate-degrading activities which could help the farmed abalone H. diversicolor to digest diets. All results showed that a unique but interrelated bacterial flora was developed in the abalone gut which was coincident with the change of diets. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico), overfishing and climate change-linked diseases are thought to be responsible for mass mortalities and significant declines in abalone fisheries landings. Conservation aquaculture is an option for enhancing abalone populations through captive propagation and cage mariculture with subsequent restockings into the wild. To test, inform, and promote innovative sustainable seafood production strategies in the Northeastern Pacific, we designed an experimental mariculture system at San Jeronimo Island, Baja California. We explored the feasibility of rearing juvenile red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, in a near-shore mariculture cage-based production system to supply individuals for local restoration programs. We tested the effects of 2 different depths, surface and bottom (5 m), and 3 macroalgal diets (Macrocystis pyrifera, Eisenia arborea, and a mixed diet of Pelagophycus porra with M. pyrifera) on the survival and growth of juvenile red abalone (32 +/- 3.33 mm in shell length) inside cages attached to a long-line system. Over the 90-d experiment, survival was 99% for the surface treatment and 95% for the bottom treatment. Mean daily increment in shell length was 93 +/- 12 mu m.d(-1) in surface cages and 82 +/- 13 mu m.d(-1) in bottom cages. Depth did not affect growth or survival. Growth was highest using the E. arborea diet (99 +/- 7 mu m.d(-1)) but not significantly different from the M. pyrifera and mixed diets (88 +/- 10 and 74 +/- 13 mu m.d(-1), respectively).

There are three isozymes of AIF that have been identified to date, designated as AIF1, AIF2, and AIF3; the human AlF3 is also known as an ALF-like protein (AIFL). This study aimed to identify and characterize a homologue of AlF3 from disk abalone (AbAIF3) that belongs to the phylum Mollusca. The open reading frame (ORF) of AbAIF3 is 1749 base pairs (bp) in length and encodes a protein of 583 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 63.14 kDa. Based on our in-silico analysis, the AbAIF3 protein harbored the typical domain architecture as that of the known AIF family proteins, consisting of N-terminal Rieske and pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase domain. Comparative protein sequence analysis confirmed that AbAIF3 is a homolog of AlF3. Moreover, our phylogenetic analysis revealed that AbAIF3 had a close evolutionary relationship with the molluscan counterparts. Interestingly, AbAIF3 was shown to induce apoptosis in HEK293T cells using transfection assays followed by flow cytometric analysis. In addition, we found that AbAIF3 mRNA expression was ubiquitous in physiologically important tissues, and significantly modulated upon experimental immune stimulations in hemocytes. Collectively, our study illustrates the indispensable role of AbAlF3 in inducing apoptosis in disk abalones, which in turn might be involved in hosts' immune defense mechanisms against microbial infections.

No differences in survivorship or growth were observed. Subsequent experiments examined whether abalone behaviour (habitat selection and movement patterns) differed between rearing treatments. Abalone were exposed to one of three predator treatments (sea star arm, small crab, or no predator (control)) and filmed for 8 h. Abalone from habitat-enriched tanks changed habitats significantly more often than abalone from conventional tanks regardless of predator treatment. Significant differences in the percentage of time that abalone occupied the various habitats were also observed. Abalone in the sea star and control treatments primarily occupied the rocks, whereas abalone in the crab treatment behaved differently depending on the rearing method; conventionally reared abalone spent more time in corners, whereas abalone from habitat-enriched tanks spent more time exposed.

Over 6,000 t per annum of kelp Ecklonia maxima are now harvested for this purpose, and some kelp beds are reaching maximum sustainable limits. Research into seaweed aquaculture as feed (Ulva and some Gracilaria) for abalone started in the late 1990s on the southeast coast (where there are no kelp beds) using abalone waste water. A growing body of evidence suggests that a mixed diet of kelp plus other seaweeds can give growth rates at least as good as compound feed, and can improve abalone quality and reduce parasite loads. A pilot scale Ulva lactuca and abalone integrated recirculation unit using 25% recirculation was designed and built on the south west coast of South Africa using one 12,000-L abalone tank containing 13,200 15 +/- 2.5 g abalone, connected to two 3,000-L seaweed tanks containing an initial starting biomass of 10 kg of seaweed, replicated 3 times. In an 18-month period, there were no significant differences in abalone health or growth rates, sediment build up and composition, mobile macro fauna densities and species between the recirculation or the flow-through units. Transfer of oxygen generated by the seaweeds to the abalone tanks was poor, resulting in the recirculated abalone tanks having lower (33%) dissolved oxygen concentrations than a comparable flow-through abalone unit. Seaweed nutrient content and specific growth rates in the units were comparable to seaweeds cultivated in fertilized effluent (SGR = 3.2 +/- 3.4%.day(-1); Yield = 0.2 +/- 0.19 kg.m(2).day(-1)).

UB56 strain showed the highest percentage of internalization (3.65%) and presented a moderate level of adhesion (4.6 x 10(6)). In contrast, UB152, the most adherent strain (8.7 x 10(6)) showed a low capacity to internalize (0.65%). Eight strains were able to persist intracellularly over 96 h regardless of their adherence or invasion level. Statistical analysis between biofilm-forming ability and the adhesion capacity showed no significant differences. Presence of virulence genes involved in the adhesion process (gapC, hasABC, lbp, pauA and sua) showed that the strains harboured different genes and seven patterns could be observed. Conclusion Statistical analysis showed no correlation between the virulence gene patterns and the adhesion capacity or the percentage of internalization.

We addressed all these topics by exploring interactions between the urchin Parechinus angulosus and both recruits and juveniles of the abalone Haliotis midae, in the light of the fact that juvenile abalone shelter beneath the urchins. In field experiments at six sites. urchins were eliminated from removal plots to determine the degree to which juvenile abalone (individuals 3-35 mm in length) depend upon urchins. Comparisons were made with undisturbed and disturbance-control plots. We hypothesized that after removal of urchins: (1) there would be an immediate decline of juvenile abalone, since they are intimately associated with the urchins; (2) abalone recruits (recent settlers <3 mm in length) would be unlikely to suffer immediately or directly because, unlike juveniles, they are only weakly associated with the urchins; (3) foliar algae would proliferate due to decreased grazing by urchins; (4) there would be a consequent reduction in crustose coralline algae due to overgrowth by foliar algae; and (5) the decline of crustose corallines would reduce recruitment of abalone due to a loss of settlement and nursery habitat. In urchin-removal plots, juvenile abalone declined dramatically, becoming virtually extinct locally. Their disappearance was slowest in crevices compared with exposed habitats, but even there they failed to survive longer than five months. Contrary to expectations, abalone recruits also disappeared from urchin-removal plots, possibly because the cover of sediment almost doubled there. Also contrary to our hypotheses, neither foliar macroalgae nor encrusting corallines responded to urchin removal. The explanation of these results is that P. angulosus was able to gather drift kelp when this food source was available, rather than acting as an active grazer. This feeding pattern has profound consequences and explains why urchins failed to influence algal community composition. By sheltering beneath urchins, juvenile abalone gain protection from predators and may also benefit from an enhanced food supply. Bottom-up subsidization of urchins by drift kelp is thus responsible for the feeding behavior of the urchins, and indirectly facilitates their role in harboring juvenile abalone. This role is of immense importance for the lucrative abalone fishery, and depletion of urchins could lead to a collapse of abalone populations. Human exploitation of top predators that consume urchins, such as rock lobsters and some fishes, has conceivably exaggerated the role of urchins in sustaining juvenile abalone.",10.1890/0012-9615(2002)072[0133:EOSUPA]2.0.CO;2

In the present study, red abalone, Haliotis rufescens Swainson 1822, with single sabellid infestations were isolated in containers at 18degreesC (single host and sabellid per container). This first, parental generation (P), was held in isolation until individuals produced F, larvae. The F, larvae were subsequently isolated until individuals produced a second, F-2, generation. In a separate study, uninfested red abalone were exposed to sabellid infested abalone at 11.2degreesC, 15.6degreesC, and 20.9degreesC, temperatures typically encountered in California. The larvae were subsequently observed as they developed to specific life stages: the initiation of feeding, the development of all 11 setigers (which closely relates to sexual maturation) and the completion of their life cycle as recognized by the production of motile, infesting, larvae, Approximately 50% of the sabellids examined at 11.2degreesC, 15.6degreesC, and 20.9degreesC had developed the ability to feed by day 6, 5 and 4 (P < 0.001), had developed all 11 setigers by day 83, 68 and 48 (P < 0,001) and had produced larvae by day 298, 165 and 111 (P < 0.001), respectively.

We fit 7 growth functions to annual growth increment data to estimate age at maturity, time to reach the minimum legal size (MLS) in the historic fishery, and the number of reproductive years before reaching the MLS. We used demographic data to construct a growth transition probability matrix based on the best-fit (Richards) model. We estimated that pink abalone grow slowly (k = 0.07 yr(-1)), reaching a maximum length of 200 mm, and have high adult survivorship (0.77 yr(-1)). We used non-lethal methods to estimate size at maturity, which was 99 mm for males and 103 mm for females (8.2 to 8.7 yr), with 19 yr to reach fishery size. Survival rates in this population did not differ between years or genders, but severe cuts to the foot during handling did decrease survivorship. Despite low population densities, we show evidence of some juvenile recruitment to the region. The slow growth rates suggest that the populations within the southern California abalone fishery closure area could take 30 yr to recover, provided there is successful reproduction and the high survival of adults continues without illegal fishing.

Proliferation assay based on [H-3]-thymidine incorporation and measurement of cytokines and effector molecules by RT-PCR were used to confirm tumor suppression efficacy of abalone visceral extract by modulating cytolytic CD8+ T cells. The cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cell was compared by JAM test. Results: Oral administration of abalone visceral extract reduced tumor growth (tumor volume and weight) and showed reduced metastasis as confirmed by decreased level of splenomegaly (spleen size and weight) and histological analysis of the lung metastasis (gross analysis and histological staining). Reduced expression of Cox-2 (mRNA and protein) from primary tumor and metastasized lung was also detected. In addition, treatment of abalone visceral extract increased anti-tumor activities of CD8+ T cells by increasing the proliferation capacity and their cytolytic activity. Conclusions: Our results suggest that abalone visceral extract has anti-tumor effects by suppressing tumor growth and lung metastasis through decreasing Cox-2 expression level as well as promoting proliferation and cytolytic function of CD8+ T cells.",10.1186/1472-6882-10-60

Animals of 10, 30 or 60 mm initial shell length were exposed to ambient (6-10 degrees C), 14, 18, 22 and 26 degrees C for 112 days in a flow-through culture system. Maximum growth occurred at 22 degrees C for the 10 and 30 mm size classes and at 18 degrees C for the 60 mm size class. Regression analysis identified the optimal temperature for growth (T(opt)G) at around 21 degrees C for the 10 and 30 mm size classes and at 17-18 degrees C for the largest size class. In a second experiment, the critical thermal maximum of H. iris was determined as a measure of thermal tolerance. Abalone were subjected to increasing water temperatures at a rate of 2 degrees C h(-1) until they detached from the substrate. Abalone of 10 mm displayed greater thermal tolerance than abalone of 30 and 60 mm in length. CT50 temperatures were 28.8, 27.7 and 27.8 degrees C, yielding deduced T(opt)G values of 19.7, 18.3 and 18.4 degrees C for the 10, 30 and 60 mm size classes respectively.

There are mechanisms to explain this phenomenon, but they are relatively few. In addition, dose-dependent primary infection is also associated with increased immunity. In the present study, the initial infection dose and mortality of abalone Haliotis diversicolor after reinfection with Vibrio harveyi were recorded, and the mechanism of immune enhancement was investigated by the transcriptomic response of abalone after two successive stimuli with V. harveyi. Priming with different concentrations of pathogen can enhance immunity; however, higher concentration is not always better. Compared with the first exposure, more genes were up-regulated after the second exposure. Among the commonly expressed genes, the immune related genes were significantly or persistently highly expressed after two infections and included pattern recognition receptors as well as immune effectors, such as toll-like receptors, perlucin 4, scavenger receptor class B-like protein, cytochrome P450 1B1-like, glutathione S-transferase 6, lysozyme and so on; in addition, these immune-related genes were mainly distributed in the pathways related to phagocytosis and calcium signaling. Among the specifically expressed genes, compared with the first infection, more genes were involved in the immune, metabolic and digestive pathways after the second infection, which would be more conducive to preventing the invasion of pathogens. This study outlined the mechanism of immune enhancement in abalone after secondary infection at the global molecular level, which is helpful for a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of immune priming in invertebrates.",10.3389/fimmu.2021.685896

Following the starvation period, wet weight loss was 13.4%. Crude protein and NFE accounted for 69.9% and 31.5%, respectively, of the total net loss in dry weight that was calculated to be a total loss of 3.57 kcal/organism. Lipid content of the tissue increased by 1.0% (dry weight) while protein content remained unchanged. Plasma levels of free amino acid, soluble protein and glucose were determined on days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 27. The level of plasma glucose significantly decreased after the first 7 days, 34 to 10 mu m/ml, and then leveled at 15 mu m/mL. Soluble protein in the plasma decreased from 3.33 to 2.6 mg per ml during the starvation period. Taurine was the principal free amino acid among the plasma amino acids, comprising approximately 50-65% and showing a net decrease of almost 75% at 27 days. For the essential amino acids, gross levels of histidine and arginine decreased significantly and correspondingly produced substantially higher net decreases. For the non-essential amino acids, plasma levels of alanine, proline, tyrosine, glutamic acid, and serine decreased significantly by day 27 or earlier, but proportional composition remained similar. After starvation, changes in the gross amounts (mu g/mg total dry weight) of some essential and non-essential amino acids in the muscle and visceral tissue occurred, but their relative proportions remained essentially unchanged. The ratio of the concentration of non-essential to essential amino acids in both the muscle and viscera (similar to 1.9) did not change after starvation. The mean net change of non-essential amino acid content per abalone (within muscle tissue) was higher (-41.8) than that of the essential amino acids -8.9). In contrast to all other amino acids, little or no loss of arginine, histidine and threonine occurred. Plasma levels of carbohydrates and protein in starved abalone dramatically decrease within the first two days and then decrease very slowly. Muscle protein is the principal source of energy, and non-essential amino acids are preferentially used. Retention of arginine in the muscle tissue may reflect its need in arginophosphate for muscle contraction. By converting the decrease in weight to energy loss, the amount of energy used for basal metabolism during starvation was estimated to be 2.99 cal g org(-1) day(-1). (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed that the weight gain rate of abalones in the groups with 0.53% and 1.24% of dietary Hyp were significantly higher than that in the group with 0.05% dietary Hyp. The 0.53% and 1.24% of dietary Hyp significantly increased lysyl hydroxylase and prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity and pyridinium crosslink content, and up-regulated collagen biosynthesis-related gene expression in abalone muscle. Meanwhile, dietary Hyp supplementation significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of mmp-1 and significantly up-regulated the mRNA expression of timp. During the same storage time, the springiness, hardness and water-holding capacity of muscle in the dietary Hyp supplementation treatments were significantly higher. The muscle hardness in the dietary Hyp supplementation groups on day 6 was higher than that in the control group on day 3.

In this research, the movement behaviour of abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) was continuously monitored under a light cycle of 12 L:12D. It was found that the cumulative movement distance and cumulative movement time of abalone reached was highest from 00:00-03:00 h. The minimum values of maximum movement velocity occurred between 21:00-00:00 h, and a significant circadian cosine rhythm was exhibited during these periods (P < 0.05). Metabolomic analysis of cerebral ganglions of abalone was conducted at 06:00 h (6 M), 14:00 h (14 M), and 22:00 h (22 M) and 380, 385, and 315 metabolites with significant differences were identified in 6 M vs 14 M, 14 M vs 22 M, and 6 M vs 22 M, respectively (P < 0.05).

It is a semi-continuous breeder and despite producing small numbers of large eggs, infestation by this animal has reached epidemic proportions on local abalone farms. The present study compared the morphometrics and reproductive characteristics of worms from farmed and wild abalone, in the Walker Bay area of the south Western Cape Province of South Africa, to gain insights into why this animal has become so successful under aquaculture conditions. The farms designated farm A and farm B each had one on-farm site, and two wild sites, while farm C had two on-farm sites and two wild sites. The wild sites were natural abalone habitats located within 2.5 km of the farms. Our results conclusively showed that environmental conditions prevalent on the farms enhanced the reproductive success of these worms relative to that observed in its natural environment. At farms B and C, worms occurred in significantly higher densities at the on-farm sites than in the corresponding wild samples, but at farm A, density was equally low at the three sites. At all three farms, a greater proportion of the population was reproductively active in the on-farm samples than in the wild samples. Worms on farmed abalone had a higher instantaneous fecundity, brooded more clutches simultaneously and were larger than their conspecifics from the wild. There was a positive correlation between adult size and brood size and the number of clutches brooded simultaneously. Within the three on-farm sites there was a negative correlation between egg volume and brood size, indicating a trade-off between these traits. However, such a trade-off was not apparent between sites, with brood size being higher at the on-farm sites than at the wild sites, irrespective of egg size. This suggests that the stable nutrient-enriched environment on the farm led to an increase in fecundity without compromising the size (and implicitly the quality) of the eggs. Worm density did not have a significant effect on body size or any other reproductive traits at most sites, and the density of T. heterouncinata was unaffected by the density of other shell-infesting polychaetes. The results suggest that the farm environment has selected for larger, more fecund worms that breed rapidly with high recruitment success as a consequence of abundant nutrients, high host density, habitat stability and a possible lack of predation and interspecific competition.",10.1007/s00227-005-1552-6

In this study, the seasonal variation in the nutritional components and texture properties of Haliotis discus hannai (DD) and Haliotis discus hannai 9 x H. fulgens delta (DF) was determined. The moisture content of both abalone varieties (DD and DF) was found to be significantly lower in winter than in other seasons, while the opposite was true for the lipid content. In summer, DF had lower levels of protein, lipid, and taurine than DD. The levels of glycine (Gly), alanine (Ala), glutamic (Glu), and arginine (Arg) in abalone were higher in winter and spring than in summer and autumn. In terms of fatty acid levels, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the total amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were the highest in winter compared to other seasons. In addition, in terms of textural properties, the chewiness, cohesiveness, fracturability, springiness, and resilience of abalone muscles were better in winter than in summer. The seasonal variation in the nutritional quality of abalone may be closely related to the different water temperature environments of abalone, the level of resistance to high temperatures, and the timing of gonadal development.

This question is becoming more pressing as trophic interactions shift with rapid climate change. Sea urchins and abalone are key invertebrates in the habitats where they reside. Sea urchins are critical members of exemplar trophic cascades in kelp forests due to their impact on kelp establishment and maintenance; yet their populations are controlled by predators, such as sea otters and sunflower sea stars. Abalone compete with urchins for macroalgal food resources and therefore can help regulate urchin populations in kelp forests. Given that both urchin tests and abalone shells used for predator defense are comprised of calcium carbonate, much research has been conducted on the impacts of ocean acidification (OA) on these calcified structures. A growing body of literature has shown that urchin tests are less calcified and break with less force under OA conditions. Less is known about abalone, but their shells also appear to respond negatively to OA. Using kelp forest communities as exemplar ecosystems, we discuss the morphological, biomechanical, and physiological responses to OA in urchins and abalone and consider how these individual level responses scale to trophic interactions and ultimately whole ecosystem processes. Although the impacts of OA on the calcified structures used for defense have been well studied, calcified mechanisms for food consumption, such as the Aristotle's lantern of urchins, are much less understood. Thus, examining both the feeding and defense sides of trophic interactions would greatly improve our understanding of OA responses across individual to ecosystem scales. More generally, measurements of morphological, biomechanical, and physiological responses to OA can be made in individuals to help predict higher level ecological responses, which would greatly contribute to broader predictions of whole ecosystem responses to OA.",10.1093/icb/icae096

Amino acid alignment revealed that HdhNFT shared high similarity with other known ferritins. The HdhNFT contained a highly conserved motif for the ferroxidase center, which consists of seven residues of a typical vertebrate heavy-chain ferritin with a typical stem-loop structure. HdhNFT mRNA contains a 27 bp iron-responsive element (IRE) in the 5'-untranslated region. This IRE exhibited 82.14% similarity with abalone H. discus discus and 78.57% similarity with Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas IREs. By real-time PCR assays, the mRNA transcripts of HdhNFT were found to be higher expressed in kidney, hepatopancreas, gill, mantle and muscle than in haemocytes and gonad. Moreover, mRNA expression levels of HdhNFT in the hepatopancreas and haemocytes were measured by real-time PCR in abalone fed with graded levels of dietary iron (29.2, 65.7, 1267.2 and 6264.7 mg/kg). Results showed that the expression of the HdhNFT mRNA increased with dietary iron contents. Furthermore, the maximum value of the HdhNFT mRNA was found in the treatment with 6264.7 mg/kg of dietary iron.

Reducing the adverse effects of high stocking density while maintaining high biomass is essential to address these problems. Here, we conducted a laboratory experiment to simulate the multi-layer culture for sea urchins at ambient high temperatures (from 22.2 to 24.5 degrees C) in summer for similar to 7 weeks. Survival, body size, lantern growth, gut weight, food consumption, Aristotle's lantern reflex, 5-hydroxytryptamine concentration, pepsin activity and gut morphology were subsequently evaluated. The present study found that multi-layer culture led to significantly larger body size than those without multi-layer culture (the control group). This was probably because of the greater feeding capacity (indicated by lantern growth and Aristotle's lantern reflex) and food digestion (indicated by morphology and pepsin activity of gut) in the multi-layer cultured sea urchins. These results indicate that multi-layer is an effective approach to improving the growth efficiency of sea urchins at high temperatures. We assessed whether eliminating interaction further improve these commercially important traits of sea urchins in multi-layer culture. This study found that eliminating interactions displayed greater body size and Aristotle's lantern reflex than those not separated in the multi-layer culture. This approach also significantly reduced the morbidity compared with the control group. These novel findings indicate that eliminating interactions in multi-layer culture greatly contributes to the growth and disease prevention of sea urchins at high temperatures.

However, observed differences in species susceptibility to the disease are not well understood. Here, we examined the susceptibility of three temperate abalone species, the cool water (4-14 degrees C) pinto or northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana), the intermediate water (8-18 degrees C) red abalone (H. rufescens), and the warm water (12-23 degrees C) pink abalone (H. corrugata), to experimental WS infection at temperatures facilitating disease proliferation. Mortality data paired with histological and molecular detection of the WS pathogen confirmed that these abalone species exhibit different levels of susceptibility to infection and resistance to WS development ranging from high susceptibility and low resistance in pinto abalone to moderate/low susceptibility and resistance in red and pink abalones. The temperature associated with WS induced mortalities also varied among species: pinto abalone died at the lowest experimental temperature (17.32 +/- 0.09 degrees C), while red abalone died at an intermediate temperature (17.96 +/- 0.16 degrees C), and pink abalone required the highest temperature (18.84 +/- 0.16 degrees C). When data from the current and previous studies were examined, susceptibility to WS was inversely related to phylogenetic distance from white abalone (H. sorenseni), which had the highest susceptibility and lowest resistance of all abalone species tested prior to the current study. These results provide further evidence that an abalone's thermal optima and phylogenetic relationship can determine its susceptibility to WS; species with cool water evolutionary histories are most susceptible to WS and the most susceptible species appear to be closely related. Differences among the thermal ranges of abalone species have broad implications for WS disease dynamics and highlight the importance of understanding the mechanisms governing the abalone-WS relationship in order to properly manage declining abalone populations.",10.1016/j.jip.2017.11.005

To determine the longitudinal growth characteristics of Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), shell colour rings were manipulated by feeding alternative algae, and shell length (SL) identification was performed at different ages. Eight SL records were obtained from 3147 individuals in 192 full-sib families at 6, 7, 9, 13, 18, 24, 28, and 32 months after hatching. To estimate the additive genetic and environmental variance components, longitudinal genetic analysis of repeated SL measurements was conducted using multivariate, auto-regressive, antedependence and random regression models with restricted maximum likelihood method. The results showed that the multivariate model with common full-sib family variance and residual heterogeneity of variance was the best model for the given dataset. Heritability estimates showed a decreasing trend with age, which is similar to the results obtained from the quadratic polynomial random regression model, and ranged from 0.629 at 9 months to 0.259 at 32 months. The separate rearing and tagging of single abalone at 6 months may have led to significant common environment family bias and overestimation of heritability. The antedependence model did not achieve a better fit for the obtained dataset. Estimates of genetic correlation between contiguous ages were high, ranging from 0.622 between 6 and 32 months to 0.987 between 28 and 32 months. The results demonstrated that genetic gain can be obtained in selection for Pacific abalone growth and outlined information regarding the age at which selection should be performed. This study can provide data and guidelines to a Pacific abalone selection program for growth related-traits.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.739020

Both stability and pellet toughness were influenced more by the protein source than by the type and concentration of the binder, as diets containing abalone viscera silage lost 20% dry matter, compared to the 10% lost in diets containing fish meal. However, nutrient leaching was not affected by the phycocolloid concentration. This result coincides with previous reports that leaching speed does not depend on stability. In general, all the binders used were effective at low concentrations (0.5%); therefore, the use of phycocolloids at low concentrations is recommended. Attention should also be given to the ingredients used, as these may have a greater influence on stability and toughness than the binders themselves.",

However, oxidative stress can be inhibited by enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense mechanisms. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are well-known scavengers of superoxide radicals, and they protect cells by detoxifying hazardous reactive oxygen species. Here, we have identified and characterized two different SODs, CuZnSOD and MnSOD, from black rockfish (RfCuZnSOD and RfMnSOD, respectively). In silica analysis revealed the well conserved molecular structures comprising all essential properties of CuZnSOD and MnSOD. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that both RfCuZnSOD and RfMnSOD cladded with their fish counterparts. The recombinant RfSOD proteins demonstrated their potential superoxide scavenging abilities through a xanthine oxidase assay. The optimum temperature and pH conditions for both rRfSODs were 25 degrees C and pH 8, respectively. Moreover, the potential peroxidation function of rRfCuZnSOD was observed in the presence of HCO3-. The highest peroxidation activity was observed at 100 mu g/mL of rRfCuZnSOD using the MTT cell viability assay and flow cytometry. The analogous tissue-specific expression profile indicated ubiquitous expression of both RfCuZnSOD and RfMnSOD in selected tissues of healthy juvenile rockfish. An immune challenge experiment illustrated the altered expression profiles of both RfCuZnSOD and RfMnSOD against lipopolysaccharide, Streptococcus iniae, and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C).

Conventional community indices showed no significant differences among three sampling stations. The overall continuum of stable isotope ratios was structured into three different trophic linkages: (i) brown algae-dependent benthic food chain; (ii) red algae-dependent benthic food chain; and (iii) planktonic food chain. Brown algae and red algae likely play different roles with respect to carbon sources in the habitat. Conventional fractionation values indicated that the abalone H. diversicolor (delta C-13 = -12.4 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand, delta N-15 = 9.3 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand) feeds on the lamina of Undaria pinnatifida during juvenile and adult stages (8.0-65.6 mm shell length). Stable isotope signatures suggested that the juveniles of other abalone species as well as some amphipods and a sea cucumber Holothuria decorata are competitors of H. diversicolor, whereas some Muricidae gastropods such as Thais bronni and Ergalatax contractus are predators. The isotopic differences among macroalgal species and the subsequent transfer to consumers indicate that stable isotopic analysis is an effective means of studying food webs in an open rocky shore community with little influence from external primary production such as terrestrial vegetation.",10.1111/j.1444-2906.2007.01444.x

In this study, a member of the invertebrate defensins was cloned and characterized from the small abalone Haliotis diversicolor, designated HdDef-2. The HdDef-2 cDNA contained a 201 bp open reading frame encoding 66 amino acids including a signal peptide of 18 amino acids and a mature peptide of 48 amino acids. The mature peptide of HdDef-2 possessed similar features to other AMPs, such as lower molecular mass, net positive charge (+1), and a high hydrophobic residue ratio (45%). In addition, six cysteines in the mature peptide were arranged in the pattern C-X-16-C-X-3-C-X-9-C-X-4-C-X-1-C and stabilized the alpha-helix/beta-sheet motif (CS alpha beta) with three disulfide bonds (C1-C4, C2-C5 and C3-C6) in the predicted tertiary structure. Moreover, the similar three-dimensional structure to Anopheles gambiae defensin and a phylogenetic analysis suggest that HdDef-2 may be a new member of the arthropod defensin family. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that HdDef-2 transcripts were constitutively expressed in the mantle, gill, hepatopancreas, and foot, with the highest level in the hepatopancreas. It was observed that HdDef-2 transcripts were significantly induced in the hepatopancreas after infection by Vibrio harveyi.

"Lin, A; Meyers, MA",Growth and structure in abalone shell,2005,MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING,390,1-Feb,27,41,,"The growth and self-assembly of aragonitic calcium carbonate found in the shell of abalone (Haliotis) is described. This was accomplished through the close examination of laboratory-grown flat pearl samples and cross-sectional slices of the nacreous shell. Further understanding of the sequenced assembly has been obtained. It has been confirmed that the growth of the aragonite component of the composite occurs by the successive nucleation of aragonite crystals and their arrest by means of a protein-mediated mechanism; it takes place in the Christmas-tree pattern [Nature 49 (1994) 371]. It is shown that the protein layer is virtually absent where plates on a same plane abut (along lateral surfaces of tiles). This suggests a mechanism of c-axis aragonite growth arrest by the deposition of a protein layer of approximately 20-30 m that is periodically activated and determines the thickness of the aragonite platelets, which are remarkably constant (0.5 mum). This platelet size was measured for animals with shell diameters of 10, 50, and 200 mm and was found to be constant. The overall growth process is expressed in terms of parameters incorporating the anisotropy of growth velocity in aragonite (V-c, the velocity along c axis, and V-ab, the velocity in basal plane). Comparison of laboratory-raised and naturally-grown abalone indicates growth regulated by the level of proteinaceous saturation. Naturally-grown abalone exhibits mesolayers (growth bands) similar to0.3 mm apart; it is proposed that they result from seasonal interruptions in feeding patterns, creating thicker (similar to10-20 mum) layers of protein. These mesolayers play a critical role in the mechanical properties, and are powerful crack deflectors. The viscoplastic deformation of the organic inter-tile layers is responsible for the significant improvement of tensile strength over the tensile strength of monolithic aragonite.

In this study, a histone H2A full-length cDNA was cloned from disk abalone Haliotis discus discus. We identified a 40-amino acid AMP designated as abhisin from the N-terminus of the abalone histone H2A sequence. Abhisin shows the characteristic features of AMPS including net positive charge (+13), higher hydrophobic residues (27%) and 2.82 kcal/mol protein binding potential. Abhisin shares 80% amino acid identity with the buforin 1 peptide that is derived from Asian toad histone H2A. We synthesized the synthetic peptide of abhisin, and characterized its antimicrobial activities. Our results showed the growth inhibition of Gram positive (G+) Listeria monocytogenes, Gram negative (G-) Vibrio ichthyoenteri bacteria, and fungi (yeast) Pityrosporum ovale by abhisin treatment at 250 mu g/mL However, stronger activity was displayed against the G+ than G- bacteria. Additionally, scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation results confirmed that P. ovale cells were damaged by abhisin treatment. Interestingly, abhisin treatment (50 mu g/mL) decreased the viability of THP-1 leukemia cancer cells approximately by 25% but there was no effect on the normal veto cells, suggesting that abhisin has cytotoxicity against cancer cells but not normal cells. Quantitative real time RT-PCR results revealed that histone H2A transcription was significantly induced at 3 h post-infection with bacteria in abalone gills and digestive tract These results suggest that abhisin is a potential antimicrobial agent, and its precursor histone H2A may be involved in the innate immune defense system in abalone.

At appropriate concentrations, SeNPs can promote growth, boost immunity, and modulate intestinal microbiota in aquatic animals. However, their effects on the metabolome of aquatic species have not yet been identified. This study evaluated the in vitro effects of our previous synthesized SeNPs, coated with abalone visceral polysaccharide-protein complexes (PSP-SeNPs), on the proliferation of probiotics and common aquatic pathogens, and the in vivo effects on the gut microbiome and metabolome of tilapia. PSP-SeNPs selectively promoted the growth of probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactococcus lactis, while inhibiting the growth of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Aeromonas hydrophila. In the fish breeding experiment, 360 healthy juvenile tilapias (initial weight 1.5 +/- 0.5 g/fish) were divided into four groups (3 replicates/group, 30 fish/replicate): group C was fed with basal diet, groups Y, M and H, were fed with the basal diet supplemented with 0.3 mg/kg of Na2SeO3, 0.3 mg/kg of PSP-SeNPs, and 4.5 mg/ kg of PSP-SeNPs, respectively. All fish were tested after 7 weeks of breeding in a recirculating aquaculture system. Results showed that group M significantly increased intestinal microbial diversity and potential probiotics (e.g., Cetobacterium, Fimbriiglobus, and Gemmata), while significantly decreased potential pathogens (Plesiomonas, Citrobacter freundii, and Aeromonas hydrophila). Groups H and Y significantly reduced Citrobacter freundii, but both groups decreased gut microbial diversity to varying degrees. Additionally, the pathogenic bacterial genus Plesiomonas significantly increased in group Y. In group M, the growth-promoting intestinal metabolite alpha-tocotrienol was significantly upregulated, whereas some essential amino acids were significantly downregulated in groups Y and H. In summary, 0.3 mg/kg SeNPs supplementation can regulate the intestinal microbiota, while 4.5 mg/kg SeNPs and 0.3 mg/kg Na2SeO3 can cause amino acid metabolism disorders.

Adult snails (shell length: 9.09 +/- 0.87 mm) were fed diatoms, including pennate marine diatom (Nitzschia grossestriata), boat-shaped diatom algae (Navicula sp.) and Cylindrotheca sp., along with giant tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon) commercial feed, sea lettuce (Ulva lactuca), or Cladophora fascicularis, while snail larvae (shell length: 154.85 +/- 6.03 mu m) were fed Isochrysis galbana or Chaetoceros muelleri. The diatom group outperformed commercial feed and U. lactuca groups. The highest capsule productivity, yielding 79-82 capsules in 4 weeks, occurred at 15%o-20%o salinity for diatom-fed adults. Embryos thrived at 0%o but didn't hatch; hatching required salinities above 0%o, highlighting saline necessity. In addition, acute salinity changes (0%o to 30%o) can deform embryo. Embryonic development at 15%o-20%o salinity lasted 13.56-14.33 days with 100% larval hatching. However, larvae hatched at >20%o salinity exhibit improved the percentage of survival without feeding (longer median lethal times). I. galbana-fed larvae survived 68 days with a 75% rate, outlasting C. muelleri-fed larvae which perished within 28 days. I. galbana-fed larvae, raised for 68 days at 25%o salinity, showed 100% survival, 44.44% metamorphosis, and a 3.1 times growth increase. Metamorphosis rates were highest at 25%o salinity with I. galbana, exceeding the 20%o group by 3.2 times.

The use of LWMs takes advantage of the filter-feeding nature of the worms, versus the herbivory of the host abalone. Initial observations indicated that the pest was capable of feeding on particles ranging from 3-30 mu m in size. Lipid-walled microcapsules were prepared using different combinations of lipids (tristearin, tripalmitin, and fish oil) to encapsulate water-based solutions. Feeding experiments using worm-infested shells indicated that in a relatively short time (30-60 min) most of the worms (80-95%) fed on the LWMs and that large numbers of LWMs were ingested. Fecal pellets containing LWMs were observed in the rectums of worms within 15-30 min. Feeding efficiency was examined using different concentrations of LWMs. The sabellid worm was an efficient feeder. At low particle densities (2.6 x 10(4) particles/mL), 66.7% of the worms had eaten modest levels of LWMs. An asymptote in particle density in relation to feeding occurred at 2.6 x 10(5) particles/mL, with 83% of the worms feeding on large numbers of particles. In separate observations, LWMs composed of tripalmitin and fish oil were observed in various stages of digestion in the stomach, rectum, and fecal pellets of the worms. Microcapsules were also observed in the digestive tract of mud worms, Polydora spp. that were also inhabiting abalone shell. The utility of LWMs for delivery of toxins to the sabellid pest holds much promise in ridding the industry of this nuisance species.",

The present Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) approach study showed that Gracilaria can be cultured best at 1 m depth whereas Macrocystis has an especially good growth response at 3 m depth. Both species use available nitrogen efficiently.

The demand of Macrocystis for abalone feeding is increasing, thus improving the opportunity for developing an integrated nutrient waste recycling activity in Chile. Although Gracilaria shows a higher nitrogen uptake capacity than Macrocystis, its market value does not yet allow a massive commercial scaling.",10.1007/s10811-007-9297-x

The system is designed to allow artificial micro-particulate food to be sprayed (continuously until abalone are capable of feeding on seaweed) onto bard corrugate plastic plates, using agar as a fixative. Two trials were conducted to test substances that could be utilized to improve the settlement and metamorphosis rate of larval Haliotis discus discus when using the above experimental system. In trial 1, plates were sprayed with a mixture containing 1% agar and one of the following: natural diatom powder, Spirulina powder, Chlorella powder and two different concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), each with and without antibiotics. The negative control was a clean plastic plate without any additives and the positive control was plastic plates covered with a living natural diatom biofilm. There was no significant difference in the final metamorphosis rate of larvae induced to settle on the three microalgal powders and the positive control (25.8-35.8%). However, these treatments had a significantly higher larval metamorphosis rate when compared to the negative control and the GABA treatments (1.7-7.5%). GABA did not induce metamorphosis of larvae at a significantly higher rate than the negative control, regardless of whether antibiotics were used or not. In trial 2, the effect of using both algal powders and mucus was tested to determine settlement and metamorphosis rates of larval abalone. Combining the effects of mucus and micro-algal powders or the positive control and mucus resulted in a final larval settlement rate of 80.8-89.2% and metamorphosis rate of 73.3-87.5%. This was significantly higher than the treatments that only incorporated micro-algal powder or the positive control, having an attachment rate of 20.8-41.7% and a total metamorphosis rate of only 3.3-28.3%. There is potential to use micro-algal powder as a substitute to living diatoms, to act as a settlement cue for larval H. discus discus. Abalone mucus should also be used in addition to microalgal powders to increase the settlement rate of larvae and also ensure a high rate of metamorphosis. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This parasite showed high resistance to six other potential disinfectants:formalin, iodophor, isopropanol, methylene blue, malachite green, and copper sulfate. The antibiotic fungicide cycloheximide at 1-2 mg per l for 23 h per day on 5 consecutive days proved efficacious. However, this treatment had three disadvantages: (1) it was detrimental to some diatoms upon which the abalone fed, (2) it was ineffective against non-growing but infective zoospores of L. haliotidis and thus reinfection usually occurred within 2-3 weeks following treatment, and (3) it resulted in cycloheximide resistant forms of L. haliotidis. Two different combinations of three sulfonamides (sodium sulfamethazine and sodium sulfathiazole with either sodium sulfapyridine or sodium sulfacetamide), especially in conjunction with neomycin sulfate, partially retarded the progression of the disease. Nine other therapeutic agents (betanaphthol, acriflavin hydrochloride, rivanol, furanace, oxytetracycline, chloramine-B, oxolinic acid, metronidazole, and neomycin sulfate) showed little or no activity against L. haliotidis at concentrations higher than would be feasible for use in an abalone culture facility.",10.1016/0044-8486(89)90098-7

In this study, we describe a novel transcription factor activator protein-1 (Ap-1) gene from disk abalone Haliotis discus discus (AbAp-1) for the first time in mollusk. It was identified by homology screening of an abalone normalized cDNA library. The cloned AbAp-1 consists of 945 bp coding region that encodes a putative protein containing 315 amino acids. The AbAp-1 gene is composed of a characteristic Jun transcription factor domain and a highly conserved basic leucine zipper (bZIP) signature similar to known Ap-1 genes. The AbAp-1 shares 46, 43 and, 40% amino acid identities with fish (Takifugu rubripes), human and insect (Ixodes scapularis) Ap-1, respectively. Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis confirmed that AbAp-1 gene expression is constitutive in all selected tissues. AbAp-1 was upregulated in gills after bacteria (Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahemolyticus and Lysteria monocytogenes) challenge; and, upregulated in hemocytes and gills by viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) challenge. Shell damage and tissue injury also increased the transcriptional level of Ap-1 in mantle together with other transcription factors (NF-kB, LITAF) and proinflammatory TNF-alpha. All results considered, identification and gene expression data demonstrate that abalone Ap-1 is an important regulator in innate immune response against bacteria and virus, as well as in the inflammatory response during tissue injury. In addition, stimulation of Ap-1 under different external stimuli could be useful to understand the Ap-1 biology and its downstream target genes, especially in abalone-like mollusks.

The treatments used in the study were Ambient water temperature + sand (A + S), Ambient water temperature without sand (A-S), Cold water temperature + sand (C + S), and Cold-water temperature without sand (C-S). The cold/constant water temperature was 16 degrees C and was representative of winter conditions while the ambient/fluctuating water temperature fluctuated between 16.4 and 18.7 degrees C and was representative of spring conditions. At the end of the study, the sea cucumbers in A + S and C + S treatment groups exhibited an overall weight increase of 21.08% and 6.18%, respectively.

However, little is known about the involvement of other 5-HT receptor subfamilies in the reproduction process. In the present study, we identified the cDNAs encoding eight subtypes of 5-HT receptors from the ganglia tissues of the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai (Mollusca; Gastropoda; Haliotidae), and examined the gonadal expression of the transcripts of 5-HT receptors. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that the molluskan 5-HT receptors are largely classified into four major clades: 5-HT1/5/7, 5-HT2, 5-HT4, and 5-HT6. Among the H. discus hannai (Hdh) 5-HT1-7 transcripts, HdhS-HT1B, 4A, 4B, and 6 were the major subtypes detected in the mature ovary. Estradiol-17 beta injection into the pedal sinus induced the downregulation of 5-HT4B and upregulation of 5-HT6 transcripts in the ovary of mature abalone within 72 h.

Conventional methods such as gut content analysis and feeding trials provide some insight into diet choice, but the associated biases of these techniques create uncertainty surrounding the aforementioned variability in abalone diet. We use combined stable isotope and fatty acid analysis to determine the relative contribution of red algae, brown algae and detritus/microalgae to the diet of wild abalone in Tasmanian waters. Stable isotopes of carbon suggest that brown algae and/detritus are a more important source of carbon than red algae. Fatty acid analysis confirmed the larger contribution of brown algae to the diet of abalone, and also identified the bacterial and diatom component of detritus to be an important contributor to abalone diet.

However, the morphology and structure of its visual organs and the mechanisms underlying its perception of cyclical light variations are unknown. This study analyzed the Retinalbinding protein (RALBP) gene to elucidate its role in the abalone's visual system. Using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique, the RALBP gene was cloned, revealing an open reading frame (ORF) of 1188 bp encoding 396 amino acids. A recombinant expression vector was subsequently constructed to produce a recombinant protein with a molecular weight of 45.3 kDa. This purified recombinant protein was used as an antigen to generate a polyclonal antibody, with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results indicating an antibody potency of >= 512 K. Immunofluorescence assays demonstrated strong RALBP signals in the pigment epithelial and photoreceptor cell layers of the retina, with no detection in other retinal layers. To evaluate circadian expression patterns of RALBP under different light spectra, including full-spectrum natural light, short-wavelength blue light (450 nm), and long-wavelength orange light (560 nm), western blotting and the Cosinor program were utilized. The results revealed significant cosine rhythmic expression of RALBP under all light conditions (P < 0.05), with higher expression levels during the day compared to the night (P < 0.05). This is the first study that provides insights into the morphological and structural characteristics of the abalone retina and demonstrates that the abalone's ability to detect cyclical light changes is determined by the diurnal expression of RALBP.

The results of a pilot study suggested that abalone released at 9-month age survived at similar rates to previous releases at 20 months but that there was a significant cost to growth and survival for the 14-month releases. From 2019 to 2022, an average of 7000 mixed-age juveniles were released on a different subset of 24 restoration sites each year. Larger individuals (> 5 mm) from each family were released at 9 months (first years), with the remainder held in the hatchery to be released at 20 months (second years).

About 63% of the energy content of the food consumed (C) is lost as faeces (F) and a further 32% expended on respiration (R). Energy losses in the form of ammonia excretion aree negligible, accounting for less than 1% of consumption. Some 5% of energy intake, or 13% of absorbed ration (Ab) is thus available for growth and reproductive output (Pg and Pr). In juveniles (< 100 mm) this is all allocated towards somatic growth, while in adults an increasing proportion of production is expended on reproductive output. Although feeding, respiration and excretion rates all increase with temperature the proportions of energy allocated to the various components of the energy budget appear to be consistent. Population energy budgets are calculated from density and size distribution surveys at two study sites.

Western blot and qPCR results revealed the anti-inflammatory potential of EMSA through inflammatory signaling pathways, further confirmed by in vivo re-sults and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. Therefore, EMSA can produce low-cost and high-quality alginate for several fields, such as functional foods using E. maxima stipes, a natural source such as functional foods, pharmaceuticals, and nutraceuticals.",10.1016/j.jff.2023.105539

This study examined the influence of temperature on the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of oral OTC treatments on WS-RLP infected red abalone, H. rufescens. Medication was administered in an artificial diet containing 1.85% active OTC at a rate of 103.4 mg/kg abalone for 10, 20 and 30 days at both 13.4 C and 17.3 degrees C. Drug residue concentrations, WS-RLP burden and WS-associated pathological changes within foot muscle and digestive gland were measured 3,17, 23, 42, 63, 81,102,122, and 160 days after OTC treatment. In all samples the highest concentrations of OTC were detected on the first sample day. Furthermore, all sampling periods showed significantly less OTC in foot muscle samples relative to corresponding digestive gland samples (p<0.001). While drug deputation occurred rapidly from foot muscle, unusually high concentrations and long deputation times were measured within the digestive gland. The pharmacokinetic trends in both the foot muscle and digestive gland at 13.4 C were adequately described by a one-compartment model, while the digestive gland deputation models within the 17.3 degrees C treatments conformed to a two-compartment model. At both temperatures treatment duration gave rise to significant differences in OTC accumulation and depletion (p<0.001). Despite this, terminal elimination rate constants were similar. Estimated half-lives were similar among all treatments for digestive gland (23.8-27.5 d) and all treatments for the foot muscle at 13.4 degrees C (10.7-13.4 d; calculated only for the 13.4 degrees C treatments). At both temperatures all three durations of drug treatment led to significant reductions in WS-RLP prevalence, foot muscle atrophy, and mortality. WS-RLP re-challenge trials initiated 44, 88, and 122 days following the 10-day treatment at 17.3 degrees C showed reduced susceptibility to re-infection for up to 88 days after treatment, suggesting that digestive gland OTC residues confer long-term resistance to pathogen. Atomic absorption spectroscopy conducted on both foot muscle and digestive gland found significantly higher concentrations of iron, zinc, and manganese in the digestive gland, offering an explanation behind the underlying mechanism of OTC retention for extended periods within this tissue.

The hepatopancreas lipid content decreased significantly when dietary LNA content was >20.2 g/kg. Fatty acid analysis revealed that the percentage of 18:3n-3 in the hepatopancreas significantly increased with increasing dietary LNA levels, while 20:5n-3, 22:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 levels in the hepatopancreas decreased in a curvilinear manner as dietary LNA increased. Additionally, qRT-PCR results revealed that hepatopancreas mRNA expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) decreased with increasing dietary LNA, while the greatest carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1(CPT1) mRNA expression was observed in the 2.73g/kg and 36.3g/kg groups. Furthermore, hepatopancreas mRNA expression of acyl-CoA delta-9 desaturase (SCD) and fatty acyl elongase 6(elovl6) was downregulated when prawns fed the diets containing >20.2 g/kg LNA. These results indicate that dietary 18:3n-3 could decrease lipid deposition through increased fatty acid -oxidation and modulated fatty acid synthesis, and alter fatty acid composition by regulating fatty acyl elongase and fatty acyl desaturase mRNA expression in the M.nipponense.",10.1111/anu.12604

CCA was used as a positive control. Settlement rates, post-larval survival and growth of Haliotis tuberculata sp. were evaluated for different algal species tested. Results showed that Sahlingia subintegra induced significantly higher settlement rates (58.17 +/- 12.71%) compared to CCA, Ulvella leptochaete and Rhodosorus marinus. In all treatments, post-larvae were weekly fed a mix of diatoms (Amphora sp., and Navicula incerta). At four weeks post settlement, post-larval survival rates were significantly higher on CCA and Sahlingia subintegra substrates compared to the other two algal species tested. However, at four and five weeks post settlement there were no significant differences in post-larval shell length and growth rates between CCA and Sahlingia subintegra substrates. These findings suggest that Sahlingia subintegra could be a promising alternative red macroalgae providing settlement cue for abalone hatchery stages, particularly for Haliotis tuberculata sp. and could contribute to improve abalone breeding techniques through the selection of alternative settlement substrates that could be easily managed in abalone farms environments.",10.1080/00288330.2023.2297910

Results suggested that storage caused protein oxidation in RTE abalone muscles during storage, reflected by increases in carbonyl group and disulfide bond contents, as well as decreases in free sulfhydryl group and amino acid contents, which also contributed to nutrient loss. Meanwhile, oxidation led to the degradation of proteins, especially collagen con-nective proteins, which caused decline in water hold capacity of RTE abalone muscles, ultimately resulting in decreases in shear force and hardness. In addition, adding antioxidants and eliminating pro-oxidants (copper ions) through bloodletting effectively retarded protein oxidation and degradation during storage, which signif-icantly prevented texture deterioration and nutrient loss.",10.1016/j.jfca.2022.104456

The full length (1,908 bp) abalone cDNA contained a 1,824 bp open reading frame (ORF), encoding 608 amino acids (aa). The predicted molecular mass and isoelectric point were 65 kDa and 4.5, respectively. The C-terminal region showed conserved catalytic site regions, with the catalytic site residues responsible for the endoglucanase activity. RT-PCR results revealed greater hdEndgI mRNA expression in the hepatopancreas than in the digestive tract, suggesting the key site at which the enzyme is produced. hdEndgI mRNA expression decreased from baseline to the 8th week of starvation in the hepatopancreas; and once re-feeding was initiated, mRNA transcription increased to normal levels within 14 days. This suggests that gene transcription is not totally disturbed due to starvation-induced stress, showing the potential of hdEndgI as a molecular tool for identification of food availability. It further suggests that abalone can survive for 8 weeks without food. The purified hdEndgI recombinant fusion protein was shown to have in vitro activity against carboxymethylcellulose.

Variance of the proposed estimator is derived, and conditions are provided for which the proposed estimator performs better than existing estimators. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the precision of the proposed estimator in comparison with other existing estimators for estimating the population mean.

In the present study, thioredoxin 1 (named as VpTrx1) and thioredoxin-related protein (named as VpTrp14) were identified from Venerupis philippinarum, respectively. Similar to most Trx1s, VpTrx1 possessed all conserved features critical for the fundamental structure and function of Trx1s, such as the conserved catalytic residues (C-G-P-C), but lacked the other cysteine residues, while VpTrp14 contained the conserved motif (C-P-D-C). Quantitative Real-time PCR assay showed that VpTrx1 and VpTrp14 transcripts were distributed in a wide array of tissues most abundantly expressed in the hepatopancreas. The expression of VpTrp14 mRNA in the hepatopancreas was significantly up-regulated after exposure to 10 and 40 mu g/L Cd, while the VpTrx1 expression level was kept relatively constant. Both the expression levels of VpTrx1 and VpTrp14 in the hepatopancreas were induced after exposure to Cu, and increased to the peak value at 96 h under the 40 mu g/L Cu exposure. These results showed that VpTrp14 transcripts responded to metal stress more acutely than VpTrx1, and both Trxs responded to Cu stress more sensitively than Cd. Together, it was suggested that VpTrx1 and VpTrp14 perhaps played important roles in the antioxidant responses against metal stress in V. philippinarum. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) belong to a novel class of functional non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). They have a distinctive ring structure and are involved in various biological processes, including the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of muscle cells. The Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai is an economically valuable mollusk species cultivated in China. However, the modulation of muscle growth by circRNAs in this species is poorly understood. (2) Methods: In this study, we analyzed the muscle transcriptomes of 6 H. discus hannai specimens: three small (S_HD) and three large (L_HD) groups via RNA-seq and bioinformatics technology. (3) Results: The results indicated the presence of 11,744 circRNAs in abalone adductor muscle. Furthermore, the L_HD group had 250 significantly differentially expressed circRNAs (106 upregulated and 144 downregulated) relative to the S_HD group. Moreover, the bioinformatics assessment revealed that circRNAs were related to lipid transporter activity, lipid biosynthetic process, fat digestion and absorption, the single-organism metabolic process, the thyroid hormone signaling pathway, and the hippo signaling pathway, which regulates growth. Seventeen key candidate circRNAs were identified, and a core functional circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network associated with abalone muscle growth was described. Gene expression was verified using qRT-PCR, confirming the accuracy of the RNA-seq data.

In addition to the adverse effect on the abalone aquaculture industry, there is concern that this pest may become established among native stocks. Efforts to exterminate mature and immature stages of the sabellid have focused on the use of water-soluble toxic substances, coating shells with wax or other substances to smother the worms, or altering the osmotic environment without causing irreversible injury to the abalone. These approaches have not provided a dependable method for control of the polychaete. Exposure of sabellid-infested green and pink abalones (Haliotis fulgens and Haliotis corrugata) to temperatures near but below their upper thermal limits has produced the desired results. A 48-h exposure to 28.5 degrees C has effectively killed all life stages of the sabellids but caused only minor mortality among the abalone. An LD,,, 48-h upper limit for H. fulgens was confirmed at 31.5 degrees C; that for H. corrugata was established at 30.3 degrees C. Treated abalone placed in optimally circulated seawater and fed the standard food, Egregia menziesii, resumed normal growth and thenceforth displayed no further symptoms of sabellid infestation. The method is fully compatible with life requirements of the green and pink abalones, but would not be suitable for treatment of species (e.g., Haliotis rufescens) known to have upper lethal limits well below 28 degrees C.",

It is capable of more prolonged and rapid exercise than has been reported for temperate abalone. These unusual behaviours raised the question of whether H. asinina possesses enhanced capacities for aerobic or anaerobic metabolism. The blood oxygen transport system of H. asinina resembles that of temperate abalone in terms of a large hemolymph volume, similar hemocyanin concentrations, and in most hemocyanin oxygen binding properties; however, absence of a Root effect appears confined to hemocyanin from H. asinina and may assist oxygen uptake when hemolymph pH falls during exercise or environmental hypoxia. During exposure to air, H. asinina reduces oxygen uptake by at least 20-fold relative to animals at rest in aerated seawater, and there is no significant ATP production from anaerobic glycolysis or phosphagen hydrolysis in the foot or adductor muscles. This slowing of metabolism may contribute to survival at lower water oxygen levels than normally encountered by most temperate abalone. While crawling speeds of H. asinina in water are not exceptionally high, an aerobic expansibility of 5.5-fold at speeds less than 20% of maximum is more than 2.7-fold greater than reported for several temperate abalone. The high aerobic expansibility also supports the enhanced frequency and duration of flipping behaviour without recourse to the additional inputs from anaerobic glycolysis required by other abalone. Metabolic profiles of foot and adductor muscles of H. asinina are similar to those of other abalone. Common features are low activities of enzymes unique to aerobic ATP production, relatively high activities of arginine kinase, tauropine and D-lactate dehydrogenase as the predominant pyruvate reductases, and low intracellular pH buffering capacities. It is concluded that the exceptional abilities of H. asinina for prolonged and rapid exercise are supported by higher rates of aerobic metabolism rather than any enhanced capacity for anaerobic muscle work. It is unexpected, and instructive, that the exceptional aerobic expansibility is not apparent in obvious adjustments of the blood oxygen delivery system or muscle properties associated with aerobic ATP production. The absence of a hemocyanin Root effect, and the extent to which both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism can be reduced may be special features that assist prolonged exercise and survival of H. asinina when environmental oxygen becomes limiting.

Results showed that diet type and water temperature significantly affect the growth and mortality. Interaction between these factors reflected robust relationship among them, but restricted exclusively to growth. Through the study period, juveniles treated at 10 degrees C showed maximum increments of 2.5 mm (shell length), 2.3 mm (shell width) and 0.25 g (body weight) from their initial size. While maximum values of those treated at 15 degrees C for the above-mentioned parameters were 7.6 mm, 5.5 mm and 1 g respectively. In both cases, these increments were recorded for individuals fed with sardine. Mortality was significantly affected by diets and water temperature, which significantly increased under D2 [10 degrees C (20-67%), 15 degrees C (70-87%)] or 15 degrees C [D1 (30-83%), D2 (70-87%)]. According to the results, juveniles of N. arthritica could be maintained under controlled conditions, which allows growth improvement. Mortality appears to be the limiting factor, but this could be improved by the implementation of efficient culture method, basically oriented to increase the water quality.",10.1111/j.1365-2109.2008.02111.x

In this study, we identified and characterized a PPAR gene from the abalone species Haliotis discus hannai Ino. This gene encodes a peptide consisting of 469 amino acids and comprises typical four domains: A/B domain, DNA-binding domain, D domain, and ligand-binding domain. Highest homology with that of the Patella depressa (51.08 %) from multiple alignments and phylogenetic tree analyses revealed it is a direct orthologue of the vertebrate PPAR. Tissue distribution analysis demonstrated that PPAR was highly expressed in muscle and gill, with lower expression observed in the kidney, female gonad, and hepatopancreas. Dual-luciferase reporter assays indicated that abalone PPAR significantly up-regulated the promoter activity of 05 fatty acyl desaturase (05fad), a crucial enzyme in LCPUFA biosynthesis. Furthermore, C18PUFA significantly increased the expressions of 05fad and PPAR in the hepatopancreas of abalone compared to the control group fed with an LCPUFA-rich diet. These findings suggest that PPAR acts as a positive transcription factor for the fad gene, contributing to the transcriptional regulation of LCPUFA biosynthesis in abalone.",10.1016/j.aqrep.2024.102144

No recruitment has been detected recently, indicating probable reproductive failure due to low densities. A pilot programme placed a total of over 11,000 hatchery-origin juveniles, age 18-22months, at 10 sites in the San Juan Islands. Observed (naive) year1 survival averaged 10.2% (0-23% range) and was most influenced by site compared with lineage or size-at-outplant. Families survived in the approximate proportions that they were outplanted, and there was little support for an effect of size-at-outplant on survival. etection was low due to the small chance of sighting individuals on complex substrate. When derived from repeated sampling, an upper bound on naive detection rate averaged 0.38 and increased with size. When derived from a closed capture-recapture model, average detection was estimated at 0.19. Growth was highly variable and confounded with detection, but an average 3.4% of detected outplants across all sites (0-7.5% range) had reached reproductive size in 2017. A state-space model of exponential population growth was modified to account for imperfect detection and yielded an estimated density of abalone for each survey. Seven out of eight sites included in the model remained above a target abalone density of 0.3m(-2) throughout the project. The majority of tagged abalone made little net movement over weekly and annual timescales, although some emigration likely reduced survival estimates. The restoration programme is transitioning from a pilot phase to a production phase, including optimization of hatchery and outplant processes. Existing well-performing sites will receive additional cohorts every 4-5years to maintain aggregation densities. New sites will replace poorly performing ones, although this is hampered by a poor understanding of the mechanisms behind site performance.",10.1002/aqc.3004

This study aimed to evaluate post release behavior, recapture and growth rates of hatchery-reared abalone juveniles released in the Sagay Marine Reserve. From the two release trials conducted, results showed that abalone of shell length >3.0cm had lower mortality during onsite acclimation and utilized transport modules as temporary shelter for a shorter period after release. Both wild and hatchery-reared abalone preferred dead branching corals with encrusting algae as their habitat. Recapture rates were comparable between the wild (7.97%) and hatchery-reared (HR2) abalone (6.47%). Monthly growth rates were almost the same between wild (0.25cm, 4.0g), hatchery-reared (HR1: 0.27cm, 4.6g; HR2: 0.35cm, 3.8g) abalone.

We also examined the physiological condition of greenlip abalone (oxygen consumption rate, haemolymph pH and weight) during the simulation experiment. The provision of ice and supplementary oxygen reduced abalone mortalities. Omission of ice and supplementary oxygen during the transport simulation resulted in mortality rates ranging from 70% to 100%. The addition of ice to containers with ambient oxygen concentrations decreased average mortality rates by 50%. While supplementary oxygen further reduced these rates, the provision of both ice and 100% oxygen was by far the most effective combination, reducing mortalities to between 2% and 6%. Supplementary oxygen increased oxygen consumption rates of abalone above those transported at ambient oxygen concentrations. Live-transport decreased haemolymph pH in all treatments but was most pronounced in treatments without ice or supplementary oxygen.

To gain a better understanding of the anti-viral immune system counterparts of Australian abalone, gene mining strategies and domain analysis of the recently released H. laevigata draft genome was performed, with comparisons made to the better studied mollusc, the oyster (Crassostrea gigas). Significant divergence in members of the TLR, cytosolic RNA/DNA and RNA interference signalling pathways was observed between the two molluscs, with the oyster more closely reflecting that of the mammalian immune response. Interestingly, a homolog for the anti-viral RNA sensing adaptor protein Mitochondrial anti-viral-signalling protein was absent in H. laevigata, as well as the 4 other abalone protein databases currently available, despite the presence of a RIG-I homolog.

We evaluated the physicochemical parameters of the diets and their acceptability to juveniles H. fulgens. Three diets were formulated from different algae species: 1) Macrocystis pyrifera (MP), 2) Eisenia arborea (EA) and 3) mixture of both algae (MPEA). The total amount of hidrolyzed alga in each diet was 26%. Fresh E. arborea blades and the ABKELP (R) commercial diet were used as negative and positive control, respectively. Finally, the toughness, stability and acceptability of each diet were determined at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h.Results.

In laboratory experiments designed to mimic seawater chemistry in future oceans, we examined the effect of pH reduction, driven by the carbon dioxide (CO2) acidification of seawater, on larvae of the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens. Following development under CO2-acidified conditions, we measured 2 indicators of physiological response to low pH in 4 stages of larval development: (1) tolerance of acute thermal challenges and (2) quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction-determined expression of 2 genes involved in shell formation (engrailed and ap24). The results showed that low pH (pH 7.87 vs. pH 8.05 for control treatments) had a significant effect and decreased larval thermal tolerance for some developmental stages (pretorsion and late veliger), but not for others (posttorsion and premetamorphic veligers). In contrast to the thermal tolerance data, decreased pH did not affect the expression pattern of the 2 shell formation genes in any of the abalone larval stages. The results indicate larval stages were differentially sensitive to low pH conditions and this variability may play into the resilience of individual species to withstand environmental change in the longer term.",10.2983/035.029.0220

Long-term geographical isolation resulted in genetic variation between the northern and southern C. ariakensis populations. In this study, the reproductive isolation between two independent population of C. ariakensis was evaluated by hybridization. Results showed that the fertilization rate, cleavage rate and D Larval rate of interpopulation hybrids (NS-northern male x southern female and SN- southern male x northern female) were significantly lower than those of intrapopulation inbreed groups (SS and NN). Moreover, southern maternal larvae (SS and NS) have significant survival advantages. The growth trend between the two sites was very different in early stage (from 90th to 210th day), but it was consistent in late stage (from 210th to 480th day), with a significant decreasing trend of SS > NS > SN > NN. The survival rates of SN and NS was significantly higher than that of NN, indicating that the high temperature tolerance and stress resistance of hybrids were improved. The positive maternal effect advantages (MEAs) at most time points of both sites demonstrated that parental origin, especially the maternal origin, had a significant effect on the survival and growth of progeny. Hybrid advantages (HAs) for growth of both sites were opposite, and positive HAs of survival accounted for most of both sites, indicating that environmental conditions and survival could significantly affect the growth, and interpopulation hybrids did not necessarily always show positive HAs. Moreover, the maternal origin would affect the shell shape and shell hardness, resulted in NS similar to SS and SN similar to NN, respectively. Additionally, all interpopulation hybrids could produce mature gametes. These results confirmed that there was no serious reproductive isolation between the two populations.

After tagging, the abalone were fed with the macro algae species Palmaria palmata and Laminaria digitata. The mean survival rate of the population was estimated at 9.6% at the age of 4 months, with large variation among families where the highest survival was 31.5% but the lowest 0.02%. The average shell length at the age of 8, 10, 18, and 24 months old was 13.10, 15.88, 34.99, and 50.90 mm, respectively.

A low, but negative, genetic correlation between the survival rate to 4 months and shell length was observed. Genotype by environment interaction was negligible after rearing individuals from the same families in two different farms for 14 months.

The system was the first and simplest trial in a series of progressive complexity of the concept of integrated culture of seaweed, abalone, fish and clams in modular and intensive land-based facilities. Relative sizes of the modules, their stocking densities and the rate of nutrient supply were determined based on earlier results to be optimal. Effluents from two abalone (Haliotis tuberculata) culture tanks drained into macroalgae (Ulva lactuca or Gracilaria conferta) culture and biofilter tanks, where nitrogenous waste products contributed to the nutrition of the algae; net algal production from each algal tank was harvested and used to provide a mixed diet for the abalone. Excess algal yield was used elsewhere. The system was monitored to assess productivity and nitrogen partitioning over a year, while improvements were made based on the accumulating results. Total annual N-budgets were combined with mean production figures to determine a suitable ratio of abalone biomass to algal culture vessel productivity, towards commercial application of the concept. The abalone grew on average 0.26% and 0.25% body weight/d in the two culture tanks; reduced growth and increased food conversion ratios (food eaten/biomass gain; w/w) were associated with high summer water temperatures (max. 26.9 degrees C). U. lactuca showed reliable growth and filtration performance (mean production of 230 g fresh weight/m(2)/d, removing on average 58% of nitrogen supplied). Conversely, G. conferta growth was highly erratic and was deemed unsuitable for the current application. It is estimated that 1 kg of abalone biomass would require food supplied by 0.3 m(2) of U. lactuca culture, reducing N inputs required by 20% and N in effluent by 34% when compared to the two organisms grown in monoculture.

Gonad volumes were highest in October, with higher values at higher food rations. Digestive gland volumes and foot wet-weight decreased from the start of the experiment in June until November, and then increased, corresponding to food supply levels.

Adaptive response to such changes, and planning for their occurrence, requires an understanding of the underlying drivers and system responses as well as appropriate monitoring. In addition to field studies, modelling can advance our ability to anticipate or deal with such major ecosystem shifts. Here, we used an existing multi species model with smooth continuous functions that were modified to include thresholds representing 3 alternative scenarios of predator responses when prey numbers drop below a critical threshold: (I) no threshold-like response; (II) an abrupt decrease in breeding success by 90%, and (III) an abrupt halving of adult survival. Second, we analysed field observations from 3 independent marine case studies (abalone, starfish, penguins) for evidence of abrupt non-linear responses of predators to changes in abundance of principal prey. Third, we compared the model output with empirical results and tested (using both a statistical method and by fitting multispecies models) the 3 alternative response scenarios. With this approach, we found evidence for nonlinear changes in population parameters (such as survival rate) of predators as prey numbers declined below critical thresholds. As an example of the potential for this approach to inform management, we found that abundances of a range of marine predators become more variable as prey numbers decline, which may be a useful indicator that a system is approaching a tipping point.",10.3354/meps10909

The companies cultivating H. rufescens in Chile utilize plastic plates, colonized by a mixture of diatoms, as settlement substrate and food for larvae, but with poor results on abalone survival and growth. Here, we report the utilization of recruitment plates conditioned with Ulva sp. germlings, in order to evaluate larval settlement, survival and growth rate of H. rufescens postlarvae. The results were compared with traditional methods as control. Settlement was lower with Ulva sp. (52 +/- 3%) than the control treatment (86 +/- 2%). However, at Day 15, the post-larval survival in the control group was lower than the Ulva sp. treatment, reaching 59 +/- 18% and 77 +/- 8%, respectively. Survival decreased on Day 30 in both treatments. The specific growth rate of the postlarvae was higher in plates conditioned with Ulva sp.

It also takes part in the host immune defense mainly via its ability to bind to iron (III) ions. Hence, transferrin is also identified as an important acute-phase protein in host immunity. Abalones are major shellfish aquaculture crops that are susceptible to a range of marine microbial infections. Since transferrin is known to be a major player in innate immunity, in the present study we sought to identify, and molecularly and functionally characterize a transferrin-like gene from disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) named as AbTrf. AbTrf consisted of a 2187-bp open reading frame (ORF) which encodes a 728 amino acid (aa) protein. The putative amino acid sequence of AbTrf harbored N- and C-terminal transferrin-like domains, active sites for iron binding, and conserved cysteine residues. A constitutive tissue specific AbTrf expression pattern was detected by qPCR in abalones where mantle and muscle showed high AbTrf expression levels. Three immune challenge experiments were conducted using Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes and LPS as stimuli and, subsequently, AbTrf mRNA expression levels were quantified in gill and hemocytes in a time-course manner. The mRNA expression was greatly induced in both tissues in response to both challenges. Evidencing the functional property of transferrins, recombinant AbTrf N-terminal domain (AbTrf-N) showed dose-dependent iron (III) binding activity detected by chrome azurol S (CAS) assay system. Moreover, recombinant AbTrf-N could significantly inhibit the growth of iron-dependent bacterium, Escherichia coli in a dose-dependent manner. However, AbTrf-N was unable to show any detectable bacteriostatic activity against iron-independent bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) even at its highest concentration. Collectively, our results suggest that AbTrf might play a significant role in the host innate immunity, possibly by withholding iron from pathogens. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This growth should use technologies with economical and environmental sustainability. Feed accounts for about half the cost in current high-volume fed mono-species aquaculture, mainly fish net pens or shrimp/fish ponds, yet most of this feed becomes waste. The resulting environmental impact and rising feed costs therefore hamper further growth of such farms. As in certain traditional polyculture schemes, plants can drastically reduce feed use and environmental impact of industrialized mariculture and at the same time add to its income. These nutrient-assimilating photoautotrophic plants use solar energy to turn nutrient-rich effluents into profitable resources. Plants counteract the environmental effects of the heterotrophic fed fish and shrimp and restore waterquality. Today's integrated intensive aquaculture approaches, developed from traditional extensive polyculture, integrate the culture of fish or shrimp with vegetables, microalgae, shellfish and/or seaweeds. Integrated mariculture can take place in coastal waters or in ponds and can be highly intensified. Today's technologies are well studied and documented. They are generic, modular and adaptable for several culture combinations of fish, shrimp, shellfish, abalone, sea urchin and several species of commercially important seaweeds and vegetables. A I-ha land-based integrated seabream-shellfish-seaweed farm can produce 25 tons of fish, 50 tons of bivalves and 30 tons fresh weight of seaweeds annually. Another farm model can produce in I ha 55 tons of seabream or 92 tons of salmon, with 385 or 500 fresh weight of seaweed, respectively, without pollution. Preliminary calculations show a potential for high profitability with large integrated farms. Several freshwater integrated fish-vegetable farms and a couple of modem fish-algae-shellfish/abalone integrated mariculture farms exist today, and several additional farms are planned. Three major international R&D projects promise to soon expand the horizons of the technology further. Therefore, modem integrated systems in general, and seaweed-based systems in particular, are bound to play a major role in the sustainable expansion of world aquaculture. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Ecotoxicoproteomics has been employed to elucidate biological pathways affected by chemicals and provide data that can be incorporated into adverse outcome pathways (AOP) to better define the ecological risk of emerging pollutants. Microplastics (MPs) and plastic additives have raised global concern due to their widespread use in aquatic environments, bioaccumulation in tissues, and toxic effects in aquatic organisms. Despite showing sublethal toxicity in many cases, mechanisms underlying these emerging pollutants are underexplored. In this review, adverse effects and recent ecotoxicoproteomic studies of MPs and typical additives (i.e. plasticizers, flame retardants, antioxidants, and UV stabilizers) in aquatic organisms are summarized. Proteomics data show that MPs adversely affect ingestion and reproduction via disrupting pathways related to energy metabolism, stress-related defense, and cytoskeletal dynamics. Biological processes including lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis, skeletal development, neurotransmitter signaling, and immune response are modulated by additives and induce developmental malformations in fish embryos/larvae. Furthermore, plastic additives also exert reproductive toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and neurotoxicity in invertebrates (e.g. mussel, abalone, and oyster) and fish by disrupting detoxification/oxidative stress, hormonal modulation, signal transduction, and apoptosis. Additional studies are needed to complement the omic knowledge of chemical additives that are not well documented (e.g. UV stabilizers) for improving understanding into toxic mechanisms and for characterizing ecological risk linked to plastic contaminants.",10.1016/j.cbd.2020.100713

In this study, the AICT (HdAKT) and P131C (HdPI3K) gene of small abalone Haliotis diversicolor were cloned and characterized for the important status of PI3K and AICT protein in PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. The full length cDNAs of HdAICT and HdPI3K are 2126 bp and 6052 bp respectively, encoding proteins of 479 amino acids and 1097 amino acids, respectively. The mRNA expression level of fourteen genes in the PI3K-AICT signaling pathway were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that all these fourteen genes were ubiquitously expressed in seven selected tissues. Meanwhile, HdAKT was expressed in haemocytes with the highest expression level (p < 0.05) next in hepatopancreas (p < 0.05). On the other hand, the expression level of HdPI3K in haemocytes was higher than other tissues. Under normal condition, the gene expression level of HdAKT, HdPI3K, and other PI3K-AKT signaling pathway members were significantly up -regulated by Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection which demonstrated that HdAKT, HdPI3K, and other PI3K-AKT signaling pathway members play a role in the innate immune system of abalone. The mRNA expression of these genes in gills, haemocytes and hepatopancreas was significantly down regulated after the Vibrio parahaemolyticus stimulation with environment stimulation (thermal, hypoxia and thermal & hypoxia). These results indicate that the dual/multiple stresses defeat the immune system and lead to immunosuppression in abalone. PI3K-AKT signaling pathway may be involved in hypoxia/thermal-induced immunosuppression of small abalone Haliotis diversicolor. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.fsi.2016.11.011

After a long period of cultivation, several varieties of S. japonica have been developed in Korea and China. In this study, we conducted aquacultural research on the persistence of thalli from two kelp cultivars, one from China (Huangguan No. 1) and one from Korea (Sugwawon No. 301), between December 2015 and November 2016 in Haenam, Korea. The maximum length was 247.8 +/- 13.0 and 227.5 +/- 42.0 cm, respectively, which were significantly longer in Sugwawon No. 301 than in Huangguan No. 1. The maximum width was 29.9 +/- 5.4 and 23.2 +/- 1.9 cm, respectively, which were significantly wider in Huangguan No. 1 than in Sugwawon No. 301.

After August, the persistence of the thalli of Sugwawon No. 301 was two months longer than that of Huangguan No. 1. We found that the Sugwawon No. 301 performed as well as the Huangguan No. 1 in Korean waters possibly due to increased flexibility as a result of the different cell arrangements of the two cultivars. Overall, the use of the Sugwawon No. 301 cultivar rather than the Huangguan No. 1 cultivar of S. japonica appears the best alternative to help to ensure a stable year round algal feed supply for the Korean abalone industry.",10.4490/algae.2018.33.2.4

The wet body weight (BW) and test diameter growth were monitored at 2-month intervals during the experiment. At the conclusion of the experiment, the surviving sea urchins were counted and the gonad wet weight (GW) and gonad color were measured. Specific growth rate (SGR) of body weight, survival rate (SR), gonad index (GI), gonad color difference (Delta E (00)), coefficients of variation (CV) of BW, GW, GI and Delta E (00), total biomass yield (TY) and total gonad yield (TGY) per cage were calculated. Two marketable yield variables, graded according to gonad index, i.e., marketable biomass yield (MY) and marketable gonad yield (MGY), were also calculated. Coefficient of variation of final body weight (FW) and final test diameter (FTD) of sea urchins increased as the stocking density increased, indicating the existence of adverse social interactions. These adverse social interactions detrimentally affected FW, FTD, SGR, GW and GI (P < 0.01). Although SR decreased with the increasing densities, no statistical significant difference was detected. Sea urchins at D15 had the lowest gonad color difference (Delta E (00)) (P < 0.05). However, statistically equal CV of Delta E (00) indicates this density effect was not a result of adverse social interactions. TY and TGY increased with increased density and can be described by the following equations: TY = 84.18X (0.64), R (2) = 0.999 and TGY = 24.16X (0.38), R (2) = 0.979. However, the MY and MGY were not significantly different among stocking densities.

Northern abalone occur in a wide range of habitats from fairly sheltered bays to exposed coastlines. However, not all habitats are likely to support high abalone densities with large northern abalone that have high fecundity. Therefore, habitats that can support dense concentrations of large abalone would be better suited for aggregation rebuilding projects. Several experimental rebuilding projects are currently underway; the experimental sites were, in general, selected based on abalone presence and relative abundance. This study attempts to describe abalone habitat suitable for rebuilding efforts by using data from surveys completed at the start of the large decline of abalone densities observed in British Columbia (BC). Several areas were surveyed to determine abalone density on the southeast coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands and the north central mainland coast of BC between 1978 and 1980. Habitat data were recorded after each dive, including substrate types and dominant algae cover and species. Four categories of algal types were analyzed based on height and growth patterns: (1) canopy; (2) understorey (large bottom cover); (3) turf (short bottom cover); and (4) encrusting. In addition, an index of wave exposure was also calculated for each site surveyed. Northern abalone density was inversely correlated to mean abalone shell lengths. The exposure index was correlated positively to abalone density but negatively to mean shell length. Regression tree classifications successfully separated habitats of high and low abalone densities, but these differed from habitats classified using mean shell length as the response variable. To optimize rebuilding efforts, a compromise between the two classification models, one with density as the response variable and the other with mean shell length, may have to be developed.",10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[677:DNAHKH]2.0.CO;2

Large (102.23 +/- 1.79 mm in height and 24 mo old) and small (52.47 +/- 2.08 mm in height and 14 mo old) oysters were divided respectively into two groups: Group H was fed a high quantity of microalgae (approximately 2 x 10(6) cells mL(-1) at a rate of 1.0 L per oyster per day) to enhance gonad development, whereas Group L was fed a low quantity of microalgae (same cell concentrations but at a rate of 0.15 L per oyster per day) to minimize changes in their dry meat weight and NRR time. The results showed that prior to spawning the decrease in lysosomal membrane stability in Group H were negatively correlated with the changes in dry meat weight. After spawning. the dry meat weight reduced to a level that was not significantly different from their initial values on day 0. This indicates that prior to spawning the increase in dry meat weight mainly resulted from the growth of gonad tissue, and thus the stress experienced by the oysters during this period was mainly related to gametogenesis or its related metabolism and/or biological functions. The results also showed that spawning further impaired lysosomal membrane stability (P < 0.05). After spawning the NRR times remained at the lowest recorded levels for a period before recovering to levels corresponding with the water temperature in which the annuals were maintained. The smaller oysters recovered from the stress of spawning much faster than the larger animals (P < 0.05). Prior to spawning the dry meat weights of large and small oysters increased by approximately 85% in the first 42 days. whereas during the same period after spawning they only increased slightly, suggesting that the available energy was mainly used to recover from the stress created by spawning.",10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[493:TAONRR]2.0.CO;2

This study investigated the metabolic rates and use of biochemical reserves in two species of abalone, Haliotis fulgens (the green abalone) and H. sorenseni (the white abalone). Larvae of H. fulgens utilized triacylglycerol as a primary source of endogenous energy reserves for development (similar to50% depletion from egg to metamorphic competence). Amounts of phospholipid remained constant, and protein dropped by about 30%. After embryogenesis, larvae of H. fulgens had oxygen consumption rates of 81.7 +/- 5.9 (SE) pmol larva(-1) h(-1) at 15 degreesC through subsequent development. The loss of biochemical reserves fully met the needs of metabolism, as measured by oxygen consumption. Larvae of H. sorenseni were examined during later larval development and were metabolically and biochemically similar to H. fulgens larvae at a comparable stage. Metabolic rates of both species were very similar to previous data for a congener, H. rufescens, suggesting that larval metabolism and energy utilization may be conserved among closely related species that also share similar developmental morphology and feeding modes.",10.2307/1543598

Here we evaluate the duck's ecology by combining a stable isotopic evaluation of its feeding niche with records of human predation and climatic variation to evaluate (1) alternative influences on the duck's extinction and (2) possible ecological consequences of its disappearance. Results indicate that a mid-late Holocene increase in human population density coincided with a decrease in mean sea surface temperatures (SST) and an increase in SST variance, all of which were contemporaneous with the demise of the flightless duck ca. 2500 cal BP. Climate appears to be a main exogenous driver of this extinction event by not only negatively impacting flightless duck food availability, but positively impacting one of the duck's main predators: humans. Isotopic findings indicate the duck had a unique feeding ecology that overlapped equally with analog species reliant mostly on marine invertebrates (sea otters [Enhydra lutris]) and on fish (harbor seals [Phoca vitulina]). This dietary niche overlap suggests the duck's extinction could have opened foraging opportunities for harbor seals and sea otters. Otter numbers appear to have increased coincident with the duck's decline which also correlates with a decrease in size and abundance of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens), one of the otter's preferred prey. These correlations suggest that new feeding opportunities may have emerged for otters in the face of the duck's extinction, encouraging an increase in otter populations, which then had negative impacts on abalone that also were targeted by humans. Overall findings suggest the possibility of an unanticipated prehistoric precursor to the historic baseline of this nearshore ecosystem. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

The freshwater pulmonate Physa acuta is a sensitive organism to xenobiotics appropriate for aquatic toxicity testing in environmental studies. This study was conducted to explore the effects of BPA on the Gastropoda endocrine system. The effects following a range of exposure times (5-96 h) to BPA in P. acuta were evaluated at the molecular level by analysing changes in the transcriptional activity of the endocrine-related genes oestrogen receptor (ER), oestrogen-related receptor (ERR), and retinoid X receptor (RXR), as well as in genes involved in the stress response, such as lisp70 and hsp90. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that BPA induced a significant increase in the mRNA levels of ER, ERR, and RXR, suggesting that these receptors could be involved in similar pathways or regulation events in the endocrine disruptor activity of this chemical at the molecular level in Gastropoda. Additionally, the hsp70 expression was upregulated after 5 and 72 h of BPA exposures, but hsp90 was only upregulated after 5 h of BPA exposure. Finally, we assessed the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity after BPA treatment and found that it was affected after 48 h. In conclusion, these data provide, for the first time, evidences of molecular effects produced by BPA in the endocrine system of Gastropoda, supporting the potential of ER, ERR and RXR as biomarkers to analyse putative EDCs in ecotoxicological studies.

The objective of this work was to compare the growth rate and survival of red abalone cultured in two systems. Flow through (daily water exchange rate of 800%) and recirculating systems consisted of a 250 L fibreglass tank and constant aeration, but biofiltration in the recirculating system was provided with a 28 L (1 ft3) bubble-washed bead filter. Water variables were measured either daily (dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH and salinity) or three times a week (total ammonia nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen and alkalinity). Shell length was measured every 2 weeks for 18 weeks. Only the alkalinity and pH were significantly different due to the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the recirculating system. Abalone growth rate was 26.1 +/- 15.96 mu m day-1 in the recirculating systems and 22.21 +/- 18.69 mu m day-1 in the flow-through systems. The final survival was 78.74% in the recirculating systems and 71.82% in the flow-through systems. Significant differences in the final size and survival of the abalones were found between systems (P < 0.05).

In the Magellan Region (56 degrees S), the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C. Agardh presents the most extensive kelp forest, reaching a biomass of approximately 12 kg. m(-2). Recent studies have shown potential benefits from adding M. pyrifera-derived flour to salmonid feed. Research is currently underway to evaluate the use of brown algae-derived products for marine aquaculture feed of Oncorhynchus mykiss in tanks. There was no apparent adverse effect on the evaluated parameters that can be attributed to the incorporation of M. pyrifera meal in the diets fed to salmonids. Even when the control diet had numerically the best performance in zootechnical terms, the analysis of variance of all parameters evaluated showed no significant differences with regard to diets containing M. pyrifera meal.

To understand the involvement of HSBP1 in the heat shock response and embryonic and larval development of Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), the Hdh-HSBP1 gene was sequenced from the digestive gland (DG) tissue. The full-length sequence of Hdh-HSBP1 encompassed 738 nucleotides, encoding an 8.42 kDa protein consisting of 75 deduced amino acids. The protein contains an HSBP1 domain and a coiled-coil domain, which are conserved features in the HSBP1 protein family. Protein-protein molecular docking revealed that the coiled-coil region of Hdh-HSBP1 binds to the coiled-coil region of HdhHSF1. Tissue expression analysis demonstrated that the highest Hdh-HSBP1 expression occurred in the DG, whereas seasonal expression analysis revealed that this gene was most highly expressed in summer. In heatstressed abalone, the highest expression of Hdh-HSBP1 occurred at 30 degrees C. Moreover, time-series analysis revealed that the expression of this gene began to increase significantly at 6 h post-heat stress, with higher expression observed at 12 h and 24 h post-heat stress. Furthermore, Hdh-HSBP1 mRNA expression showed a link to ROS production. Additionally, the expression of Hdh-HSBP1 showed significantly higher expression in the early stages of embryonic development in Pacific abalone. These results suggest that Hdh-HSBP1 plays a crucial role in the stress physiology of Pacific abalone by interacting with Hdh-HSF1, as well as its embryonic development.",10.1016/j.fsi.2024.109660

Gut microbiota plays critical roles in the physiological functions of aquatic animals, and it is influenced by numerous factors. Previous studies about the gut microbiota of abalone usually focused on analyzing bacterial taxonomy or the impact of a single abiotic factor. However, the effect of abiotic factors, combined with biotic factors (i.e., genotype), on gut microbiota of abalone has not been systematically explored. In China, the hybrid Haliotis discus hannai. x H. fulgens. has potential for large-scale farming in southern China by its fast growth rate and tolerance to higher temperature. In this study, we analyzed the effects of diet, temperature and genotypes on gut microbiota of abalones using 16S rRNA gene sequencing data. The experiments indicate that the top three dominant genera keep consistent across various temperatures, diets and genotypes. The alpha-diversity of the microbial community was affected by temperature, genotype and diet. On the whole, the alpha-diversity of the gut microbiota of H. discus hannai was higher than that of the hybrid under the same temperature or diet. For beta-diversity, the microbial samples exhibited clear groups under abiotic gradients of temperature and diet. Some of the identified temperature-specific and diet-specific OTUs and KEGG Orthologs are related with degradation of carrageenan, laminaran and agar; metabolism of carbohydrate; biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and antibiotics, etc. According to permutational multivariate ANOVA, temperature and diet could explain almost 52% of bacterial structure variation. The gut microbiota of the two abalone genotypes have different responses to environmental gradients of temperature and diet. The gut microbiota of H. discus hannai is more sensitive to temperature, while the hybrid is more sensitive to diet, which might be the potential explanation of its tolerance to higher temperature in breeding. This study makes the first attempt to correlate the structural variation of gut microbiota in abalone by considering both abiotic and biotic factors.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735269

An important aetiological agent of this disease is bacteria of the genus Streptococcus; hence, exploring the mechanisms of virulence in these bacteria is an extremely important step for the development of effective prevention programmes. The purpose of our study was to determine the ability to produce biofilm and the occurrence of selected invasiveness factors among bacteria of the genus Streptococcus isolated from cattle with the clinical form of mastitis in northeastern Poland. Results: Most of the isolates analysed demonstrated an ability to produce biofilm (over 70%). Virulence genes were searched for in the three most common streptococci in our experiment: S. agalactiae, S. uberis and S. dysgalactiae. For S. agalactiae, only four genes were confirmed: rib (33%), cylE (78%), bca (37%), and cfb (100%). The genes pavA, scpB, bac and lmb were not present in any of the tested strains. The dominant serotypes of the species were Ia (n = 8) and II (n = 8), in addition to some strains that were not classified in any of the groups (n = 6). Out of the eight selected genes for S. uberis (sua, pauA/skc, gapC, cfu, lbp, hasA, hasB, hasC), only one was not found (lbp). Finally, two genes were chosen for S. dysgalactiae (eno and napr), and their presence was confirmed in 76% and 86% of the strains, respectively. Conclusions: The experiment showed that strains of Streptococcus spp. isolated from dairy cattle with clinical cases of mastitis in the northeastern part of Poland possess several invasiveness factors that can substantially affect the course of the disease, and this should be considered when developing targeted prevention programmes.",10.1186/s12917-017-1322-y

Jian),2017,AQUACULTURE,474,,86,94,,"An 8-week feeding trial was conducted to determine the effect of dietary glutamine (Gln) on the erythrocyte function in juvenile Jian carp. The results indicated that dietary Gln caused significant increases in haematocrit, erythrocyte count, haemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular haemoglobin content in carp blood. Dietary Gln caused significant decreases in the levels of superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, met-haemoglobin, malonaldehyde and protein carbonyl and increases in the level of reduced glutathione and the activities of Na+, K+-ATPase and lactate dehydrogenase in carp erythrocytes. These results demonstrated that dietary Gln could improve the function of erythrocytes in fish. Meanwhile, the present study explored the effect of dietary Gln on hydroxyl radical (center dot OH)-induced apoptosis in carp erythrocytes. We found that dietary Gln prevented the center dot OH-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species and the oxidation of cellular components, and restoring the non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidant activities in fish erythrocytes. These results revealed that the effects of Gln on the function may be closely associated with apoptosis in fish erythrocytes. Moreover, our data suggested that dietary Gin raised the levels of alanine (Ala), citrulline (Cit) and proline (Pro) in plasma of carp. We then examined the protective effects of Ala, Cit and Pro at the physiological concentrations in center dot OH-induced carp erythrocytes. The results indicated that Ala, Cit or Pro at the physiological concentrations suppressed apoptosis and the oxidation of cellular components, and restored the GSH antioxidant system in the center dot OH-induced carp erythrocytes. Moreover, the combination of Ala, Cit and Pro at the physiological concentrations produces a greater protective effect than their individual effects in fish erythrocytes. These results displayed that the effects of Gln on erythrocytes are at least partly dependent on that of its metabolites in fish. Ala, Cit, Pro and their combination could serve as an antioxidant or apoptosis-inhibitor in fish.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.03.041

Climate Change and Ocean Acidification disrupt the reproduction and settlement of crops, hindering shell growth and increasing the risks of pest attacks. The projected annual cost of mitigating pest species will exceed NZD 150 million. While this figure has been economically evaluated, it does not account for the additional intensification from Ocean Acidification and Climate Change. Each of these factors, alone and in combination, poses a risk of collapse for farms. Collaboration between the industry and scientists is essential for developing solutions and advancing aquaculture practices. Establishing a balanced partnership is crucial for advancing New Zealand's aquaculture sector, ensuring sustainability and resilience against challenges.

Here, we propose a loss-or-gain survival model, represented by the ratio of cumulative stress span to life span, to quantify stress resilience at organismal level. As a proof of concept, this is demonstrated by reduced survival resilience in Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to exogenous oxidative stress induced by paraquat or with endogenous proteotoxic stress caused by polyglutamine or amyloid-beta aggregation. Based on this, we reveal that a hidden peptide (cryptide)-AbaPep#07 (SETYELRK)-derived from abalone hemocyanin not only enhances survival resilience against paraquat-induced oxidative stress but also rescues proteotoxicity-mediated behavioral deficits in C. elegans, indicating its capacity against stress and neurodegeneration. Interestingly, AbaPep#07 is also found to increase cost-free longevity and age-related physical fitness in nematodes. We then demonstrate that AbaPep#07 can promote nuclear localization of SKN-1/Nrf, but not DAF-16/FOXO, transcription factor. In contrast to its effects in wild-type nematodes, AbaPep#07 cannot increase oxidative stress survival and physical motility in loss-of-function skn-1 mutant, suggesting an SKN-1/Nrf-dependent fashion of these effects. Further investigation reveals that AbaPep#07 can induce transcriptional activation of immune defense, lipid metabolism, and metabolic detoxification pathways, including many SKN-1/Nrf target genes. Together, our findings demonstrate that AbaPep#07 is able to boost stress resilience and reduce behavioral frailty via SKN-1/Nrf-governed transcriptional reprogramming, and provide an insight into the health-promoting potential of antioxidant cryptides as geroprotectors in aging and associated conditions.",10.1111/acel.14046

As lipid metabolism is closely linked with protein metabolism, protein intake during maturation may significantly influence transport proteins and enzyme activity which is responsible for supplying the essential fatty acids for gamete development. The present study investigated the influence of increased protein intake on the accumulation of certain long-chain PUFA in two species of commercially valuable sea urchin, Paracentrotus lividus and Psammechinus miliaris during maturation. Sea urchins were fed three macroalgal diets over a 90-day period. These diets included the red alga Palmaria palmata, which had been grown in seawater enriched with two levels of ammonia-N, which produced a high protein content (41%) or low protein content (32%). The third diet (or reference diet) used the brown macroalga Laminaria saccharina with a 23% protein content. The fatty acid composition of the gonads was determined by GC. Feeding the high protein diet had no effect on the maturation and total lipid in the gonad compared with the low protein diet, however, it did significantly increase the levels of docosahexaenoic acid DHA 22:6n-3 in the mature gonad tissue in P. miliaris and P. lividus. In contrast, only P. miliaris exhibited higher levels of arachidonic acid ARA 20:4n-6 when fed the high protein diet. The present study suggests that elevated protein levels can promote the accumulation of DHA and ARA in gonadal tissue during maturation, although the extent of the influence is species-specific and highlights the importance of understanding the complexities and inter-connectivity between protein and lipid metabolism when producing commercially valuable species.

Both products have substantial market demand and if the wastes of the abalone can be used as food for the sea cucumber, then both economic and sustainability goals could be addressed. Designing a simple but effective containment structure suitable for both animals, however, requires both engineering and scientific approaches. The first objective of this study was to investigate the flow field and dissolved oxygen exchange within two potential structure designs using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The second objective was to conduct a laboratory experiment, with the same containment structures, to determine if the sea cucumbers would use organic matter (food residues and feces) as a food source produced from the abalone and would show positive growth rates. The design of both containment structures included surfaces for both species to reside and move around. One of the structures utilized vertical plates with access holes between sections (called the UC) while the other was a combination of tube and plate sections (called the TC). The procedure included placing both structures in separate seawater flow through tank systems each with juvenile abalone and sea cucumbers for 7 months. The intent was to examine the growth rates of each set of animals under the same, external flow field conditions. During the experiments, only the abalone was fed. The CFD calculations were verified with tank measurements and indicated better dissolved oxygen exchange in the UC structure. Results of the sea cucumber growth experiments showed that the animals in the UC structure grew to 7.50 g from an initial wet weight value of 3.37 g. In the TC structure, however, the results were not as promising with total growth measured at 1.4 g from an initial wet weight of 3.61 g. During the 202 day experiment, specific growth rates of 0.40 and -0.47% in the UC and TC, were calculated respectively. For the abalone, a statistically significant growth rate difference was not evident between the containment structures. The study also found that the juvenile sea cucumber actually fed on biodeposits from the abalone and that the substantial difference in growth rates between structure types was due to the better flow rate in the UC.

As monitoring progresses and restoration efforts evolve to include population supplementation, a reliable and robust method of tagging individual abalone is needed. Current abalone tagging methods are unsatisfactory, particularly for long-term studies as a result of tag loss, shell erosion, and encrustation. Observing tag numbers of cryptically positioned abalone can be difficult. To obviate these issues, we evaluated passive integrated transponders (PITs) as tags for pinto abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana kamtschatkana). We applied 9-mm PITs with cyanoacrylate glue to the dorsal exterior of the shell and to the ventral anterior of the shell, and by injection into the foot muscle of small adults (trial I), and applied PITs to the ventral anterior of the shell of juveniles (trial 2). We subsequently tracked growth, survival, and tag retention over 15 mo in trial I and 6 mo in trial 2 in captivity. Among small adults (trial 1), differences in relative growth rate and survival were not significant. PIT retention by adhesion to the ventral anterior and dorsal exterior was significantly greater than injection into the foot in trial I. Between controls and tagged animals in trial 2, differences in survival were not significant. There was no significant difference in ventral anterior tag retention between trial 1 and trial 2. Gluing PITs on the ventral anterior of the shell is a promising method because abalone quickly formed nacre over the tags, incorporating them into the shell, which does not appear to affect tag detection by the PIT reader. Trials are underway to characterize PIT retention in natural habitats, to determine tag longevity, and to use PITs to track adults reintroduced to aggregations.",10.2983/035.031.0324

Larval settlement increased under high temperature, but was not affected by low pH. Despite the fact that no interaction between temperature and pH was observed, the results provide additional evidence on the sensitivity of abalone larvae to both low pH and high temperature.

The causative agent, 'Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis', occurs along the eastern Pacific margin of North America in California, USA, and Baja California, Mexico. However, as infected abalones have been transported to Chile, China, Taiwan, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Spain, Thailand and Japan, the geographical range of the etiological agent is suspected to be broad, especially where California red abalones Haliotis rufescens are cultured or in areas where native species have been exposed to this species. Susceptibility varies among species, with up to 99% losses of black abalone H. cracherodii in laboratory and field studies in the USA to no losses among the small abalone H. diversicolor supertexta in Thailand. Some populations that have suffered catastrophic losses due to WS have developed resistance to the disease. In addition, a newly identified phage hyperparasite of the WS-RLO may reduce pathogenicity and dampen associated losses. Diagnosis of WS requires the identification of infection with the pathogen (WS-RLO detected via in situ hybridization or histology coupled with PCR and sequence analysis) accompanied by morphological changes that characterize this disease (e.g. pedal and digestive gland atrophy, and digestive gland metaplasia). A quantitative PCR assay was developed and may be useful in quantifying pathogen DNA. Confirmation of infection cannot be done by PCR analysis alone but can be used as a proxy for infection in areas where the agent is established and is recommended for inclusion in health examinations.

We documented for the first rime the occurrence of animals with clinical signs of WS and associated morphological changes in another haliotid species, the red abalone H. rufeseens. In this study, 60 juvenile red abalone (8 cm) were randomly selected from a farmed population raised at 14 degrees C that was known to have low-intensity RLP infections bur lacked clinical signs of WS. The abalone were held in triplicate containers receiving water of approximately 14.7 degrees C (Control, Co) or 18.5 degrees C (elevated temperature, ET) and were fed equally for 220 d. Survival was 100% (30/30) for the Co group and 67% (20/30) for the ET group. The ET group animals had higher RLP infection intensities and showed more clinical signs (mantle retraction. lower weight gain. lower condition index) and morphological changes (digestive gland degeneration) associated with WS. In trials conducted immediately before termination of the experiment, ET group animals fed at half the rare of Co group animals. Among ET group animals, the intensity of RLP infections in the posterior portion of the esophagus was positively correlated with WS clinical signs and morphological changes, whereas no correlations were present among Co group animals.

These habitat shifts of abalone appear to occur because of its migration, associated with the ontogenetic changes in feeding behavior. Densities of 0-yr-old juvenile abalone (2010yr class) and the sea urchin Mesocentrotus nudus inhabiting the CCA largely decreased just after the earthquake and tsunami, mainly affected by the catastrophic disturbance by this event. After that, previously unrecorded recruitments of juvenile macroalgae were observed in the CCA after the event probably because of the large-scale removal of the primary herbivore, the sea urchin M.nudus. Subsequently, the KB and AT expanded into the previous CCA area. After the tsunami, the major factors causing the continuously low densities of the 0-yr-old juvenile abalone (2011-2013yr classes) are inferred to be the limited nursery CCA habitat because of mud and silt sedimentation, the expansion of the KB and AT, and/or the decreased densities of reproductive adult abalone due to the direct disturbance of the tsunami. The results of this study imply that maintaining diverse algal communities which enable the habitat shifts of juvenile abalone H.discus hannai is one of the crucial factors to their successful recruitment.",10.1111/fog.12191

Regarding the allergenic response of LMW-AV, in the present study, we further investigated the potential of oral administration of LMW-AV against atopic dermatitis (AD) in a dermatitis-induced model stimulated with Dermatophagoides farinae. The results demonstrated that the LMW-AV reduced a number of clinical symptoms, such as the severity of the dermatitis and serum immunoglobulin E levels. Moreover, LMW-AV could inhibit the expression of chemokines and cytokines. The histological analysis indicated that the LMW-AV has suppressed the eosinophil count and the mast cell infiltration into the upper dermis. The results suggest that LMW-AV can be considered as a promising candidate for AD treatment.",10.3390/md19110634

In this study a neutral red retention (NRR) assay was used to investigate the effects of size and age on the response of Pacific oysters to changes in water temperature and their recovery after exposure to different air temperatures. Results from moving oysters directly between water temperatures of 5 degrees C and 15 degrees C, 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C and 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C demonstrated that different water temperature change affect the lysosomal membrane integrity differently. The NRR times of large and small oysters transferred directly between 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C initially decreased significantly, and then increased to levels corresponding to the new temperature. In addition, NRR times in large oysters responded at a significantly slower rate than small oysters when they were transferred from 5 degrees C and 25 degrees C to 15 degrees C water and between 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C water. Results from the air exposure experiments showed that, after exposure to air temperatures of 5 degrees C, 15 degrees C or 25 degrees C, the lysosomal membrane integrity of large oysters recovered at a slower rate in 15 degrees C water compared to small oysters. It therefore appears necessary to develop different management strategies for large (old) and small (young) oysters. Results from this and previous research also indicate that the NRR assay could potentially be used to develop a model to monitor and predict the performance of oysters on farms.",10.1007/s10499-007-9098-x

The factorial effect of six stimuli (low temperature, gamma-aminobutyric acid, potassium chloride, hydrogen peroxide, dibromo methane, and coralline algae extract), five types of biofilm substrates (artificial, artificial with coralline algae, artificial with congener mucus, benthic microalgae, and microalgae with congeners mucus) and five stimulation times (6, 12, 24, 36 and 72 h) on the larval settlement of the topshell were assessed. In addition, growth and survival rates of post-larvae fed with artificial biofilm and benthic microalgae were compared. Similarly, growth and survival rates were assessed in spat cultured in different environments (outdoor and indoor), and juveniles grown in concrete tanks with different finished of the inner walls (gray rough finish, and white smooth walls with epoxy paint). A higher larval settlement was observed in substrates with artificial biofilm exposed to cold water (20 degrees C) for 24 h. Treatments with the stimulus of KCl and dibromo methane had toxic effects on larvae. There were not differences in the shell length of the settled larvae between stimuli, substrata or exposition time. Post-larvae fed with artificial biofilm had survival and growth rates similar to those maintained with benthic microalgae biofilm. The spat that were cultured in outdoor conditions showed a higher growth rate than those kept indoor, but the survival was similar in both cases. Finally, juveniles grown in tanks with rough, gray concrete inner walls had higher growth and survival rates, compared to those held in tanks with smooth white finish. The improvements obtained in growth and survival of post-larvae, spat and juveniles of C. pica suggest that there is a great biological potential for its wild populations restocking and for its aquaculture in sea-based systems.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737029

Increasing mean sea surface temperature may alter the distribution of abalone species in the northeastern Pacific, although no apparent pattern has yet emerged. Ecophysiological observations (energy budget and the temperature performance curve based on scope for growth), satellite-derived daily sea surface temperature data, and observations of the population density distribution of wild abalones were integrated. The highest temperature-dependent scope for growth (physiological optimum) was discovered between 20.5 and 28.5 degrees C, peaking at 24 degrees C, with the upper thermal limit about 30 degrees C. Off the west coast of Baja California, the distribution of abalone appears to be dictated by the tradeoff between a mean temperature close to the physiological optimum and exposure to a highly variable environment (i.e., more stress and the risk of reaching suboptimal and lethal warm temperatures at the daily scale). The findings suggest that future models of the distribution of marine species in relation to thermal habitat should contain time-domain variability in addition to spatial-domain variability.",10.1016/j.ecss.2023.108252

In this study, two novel invertebrate TLRs from disk abalone (designated as AbTLR-A and AbTLR-B) were identified and functionally characterized for the first time. AbTLR-A and AbTLR-B comprised the typical TLR domain architecture containing an extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain, transmembrane domain, and Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain. Expressional analysis revealed that both TLRs were constitutively expressed at all the early embryonic stages of disk abalone analyzed, with the highest level of AbTLR-A found at the 16-cell stage and AbTLR-B at the trochophore stage. According to tissue distribution analysis, prominent mRNA expression of AbTLR-A and AbTLR-B was detected in the hemocytes and gills, respectively. AbTLR-A and AbTLR-B mRNAs were significantly up-regulated in response to Gram-negative Vibrio parahemolyticus, Gram-positive Listeria monocytogenes, and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus injections in abalone hemocytes and gills. Overexpression of AbTLR-A and AbTLR-B in HEK293T cells directly activated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) responsive reporters. Neither TLRs showed a high response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns in vitro. Co-expression of AbTLR-A and AbTLR-B with AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X activated NF-kappa B-responsive reporters in a synergetic manner.

The spots from DD and GD were clustered together. The distance between DD and GG was maximal by hierarchical cluster analysis. A total of 112 protein gel spots were identified; of these, 59 were abalone proteins. The proteins were involved in major biological processes including energy metabolism, proliferation, apoptosis, signal transduction, immunity, lipid metabolism, electron carrier proteins, protein biosynthesis and decomposition, and cytoskeletal structure. Three of 20 differential expression protein spots involved in energy metabolism exhibited as upregulated in GD, 13 spots exhibited additivity, and four spots exhibited as downregulated in the offspring. Eleven protein spots were expressed at the highest level in DD. The proteins involved in stress responses included superoxide dismutase, peroxiredoxin 6, thioredoxin peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase. Two of seven differential expression protein spots involved in response to stress exhibited as upregulated in GD, three exhibited additivity, and two exhibited as downregulated.

"Sakai, M",Current research status of fish immunostimulants,1999,AQUACULTURE,172,1-Feb,63,92,,"Immunostimulants are valuable for the control of fish diseases and may be useful in fish culture. The immunostimulatory effects of glucan, chitin, lactoferrin and levamisole for fish and shrimp have been reported. Nutritional factors such as Vitamins B and C, growth hormone and prolactin have also been reported to be immunostimulators. These immunostimulants mainly facilitate the function of phagocytic cells and increase their bactericidal activities. Several immunostimulants also stimulate the natural killer cells, complement, lysozyme and antibody responses of fish. The activation of these immunological functions is associated with increased protection against infectious disease. Resistance to bacterial pathogens such as Vibrio anguillarum, V. salmonicida, Aeromonas salmonicida, Yersinia rukeri and Streptococcus spp. and to parasitic infections such as white spot disease can be increased by administration of immunostimulants, but not to intracellular pathogens such as Renibacterium salmoninarum and Pasteurella piscicida. The most effective method of administration of immunostimulants to fish is by injection. Oral and immersion methods have also been reported, but the efficacy of these methods decreases with long-term administration. Overdoses of several immunostimulants induce immunosuppression in fish. The side effects of immunostimulants have not been well-studied. Growth-promoting activity has been noted in fish or shrimp treated with glucan or lactoferrin. Immunostimulants can overcome immune suppression by sex hormones. Thus, the influence of immunostimulants in mature fish should be studied. In conclusion, immunostimulants can reduce the losses caused by disease in aquaculture; however, they may not be effective against all diseases. For the effective use of immunostimulants, the timing, dosages, method of administration and the physiological condition of fish need to be taken into consideration. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P] on immunomodulation in marine gastropods and to see if these effects are caused by or related to the generation of reactive oxygen species. In our present study, the marine gastropod Haliotis diversicolor was exposed to sublethal concentrations (0.01, 0.02, 0.04 and 0.08 mg L-1) of B(a)P for 7 d under laboratory conditions and the alterations of hematological parameters like haemocyte count, haemocyte viability, protein content and immune components like phenoloxidase, phagocytosis and superoxide anion generation were measured. In addition, the changes in lysozyme activity, antibacterial activity due to the effect of B(a)P on abalone were analysed. B(a)P was found to decrease significantly the total number of circulating haemocytes. Intracellular superoxide anion generation and phenoloxidase significantly increased on exposure to B(a)P, whereas phagocytic activity was decreased significantly at higher concentration. Significant alterations were found in the uptake of neutral red and the observed alterations of hematological parameters and immune components tested indicated the generation of immunotoxicological effects on abalone due to B(a)P exposure.

These relationships, studied mainly through neutral DNA markers, are not always consistent with actual biogeographic patterns or the evolutionary history of marine species. In addition, increased information at functional genomic level from non-model species allows the study of adaptive responses in marine populations. This work reports local transcriptomic patterns in populations of the mussel Mytilus chilensis and their correspondence with oceanographic variability in southern Chile. Analysis of gene expression patterns was conducted through qPCR of seven candidate genes involved in the response to environmental stress (HSP70, HSP90), iron metabolism (Ferritin), pathogens (Mytilin B, Defensin) and oxidative stress (SOD-CuZn, Catalase) in at five study sites located in southern Chile, from Valdivia (39 degrees 56'S-73 degrees 36'W) to Melinka (43 degrees 52'S-73 degrees 44'W). Multivariate and correlation analyses were used to assess the relationship between levels of individual gene expression and site features characterized using satellite data on surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration and total suspended sediments. Two main groups of sites with differential patterns of gene expression were identified. Individuals exposed to higher temperatures showed an overexpression of HSP70, HSP90 and Ferritin genes. The expression of SOD-CuZn and Catalase was correlated with local chlorophyll-a (i.e. food availability for mussels), although with opposite correlations. In addition, Mytilin B showed higher levels of expression in areas with higher freshwater influence. Patterns of gene expression across the region of interest suggest that spatial variability in environmental conditions induce phenotypic changes in different populations of the same mussel species. In addition, the analysis of expression patterns in candidate genes can reveal local patterns in populations where other molecular markers show no genetic structure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of antibiotics on larval survival was first tested within negative (filtered seawater) and positive (GABA at 10(-5), 10(-4) and 10(-3) mol L-1) control assays over 3 days. This experiment corroborated the effectiveness of using antibiotics to improve survival of larvae without obvious synergistic interactions with the GABA inducer or confounding effects of potential bacterial interactions. Chemical treatments (acetylcholine, potassium chloride, dopamine and glutamine) were then tested at various concentrations for their ability to modulate swimming behaviour and induce larval attachment and metamorphosis over 14 days. Generally, larval state shifted from swimming to attached, and from attached to metamorphosed, in the control and treatments over time. However, the peak percentage of attached and metamorphosed larvae varied in time among chemicals and concentrations. While overall percent metamorphosis was minimally enhanced after 14 days of exposure to some chemical treatments at certain concentrations, all treatments displayed significant capacities to down-regulate larval swimming and induce early attachment and metamorphosis. Mortality was recorded throughout the duration of the experiment, and was generally low (<20%) across controls and most treatments for exposures of less than 12 days. Interpretations of specific results from this study are used to elucidate neurophysiological control of larval activities for this abalone species.

Quota holders have initiated research to assess the viability of stock enhancement by release of hatchery-reared seed. Boulder reefs (1 x 2 x 0.5 m) were constructed by placing natural boulders in wire baskets over sand or bedrock. These reefs allowed accurate census of small abalone during short-term experiments (3-4.5 mo.) examining the effects of seed size [5-25 mm shell length (SL)] and density (25-640 m(-2) of seafloor) on survival and growth. Survival increased with seed size, but beyond 10 rum the increased survival did not offset the cost of larger seed. Growth and survival of 8-24 mm seed decreased with increasing density, but regressions were nonsignificant (P = 0.06-0.36) because of variability among reefs. Densities as high as 300 m(-2) gave good growth and survival (>40%) over 3 mo. on some reefs. Five natural sites were seeded with 2,600-20,000 juveniles (mean 10-11 mm SL, range 6-19 mm) at an average density of 50 m(-2) to estimate long-term survival from commercial reseeding. After 17-20 mo, when recovered abalone averaged 47-60 mm SL, survival varied widely among the five sites ranging from 1.7% to 25.1 % (average 13.8%). Estimated survival to harvest size of 125 mm SL ranged from 1.3% to 18.6% (average 10.2%) assuming 3 further years of mortality at M = 0.1. The two sites with the lowest survival were affected by substrate movement during storms, highlighting the risk of using exposed locations with boulders small enough to be turned for surveys. Survival to harvest averaged 15.2% across the three sites without significant storm damage. Growth averaged 29.5 mm SL year(-1) across the five sites (range 25-33 mm.year(-1)). A model was used to examine the economic viability of reseeding, assuming that reseeded abalone supplement natural recruits. At a price of NZ$0.32 per 10 mm SL seed, the return on investment was 20% yr(-1) at 10% survival to harvest, and 30% yr(-1) at 15% survival. These returns compare favorably with opportunity costs of similar to 10% yr(-1), suggesting that reseeding is likely to be economically viable if sites and habitat are carefully selected.

It was found that heritability estimates based on sire component ranged from 0.23 to 0.36 for shell length and 0.21 to 0.32 for shell width. Heritability estimates from dam component were larger than those from sire component at three ages, indicating presence of maternal effects, non-additive genetic effects and common environmental effects. Phenotypic correlations were significant at three ages (P < 0.05), with values of 0.92, 0.93 and 0.92, respectively. Genetic correlations from the paternal half-sib correlation analysis were highly positive at three ages, with values of 0.50, 0.78 and 0.81, respectively. The results suggest that selective breeding is an effective approach to improving growth traits of Pacific abalone stocks.",
"Hwang, EK; Ha, DS; Park, CS",The influences of temperature and irradiance on thallus length of Saccharina japonica (Phaeophyta) during the early stages of cultivation,2018,JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY,30,5,2875,2882,,"Korean Saccharina japonica is highly valued, both for human consumption and abalone feed. For the stable production of abalone feed, fresh seaweed biomass is required throughout the year. However, currently, the production of farmed Saccharina is limited by environmental conditions such as temperature, irradiance, and nutrient availability between August and November. Due to shortages experienced in supply, the production of early-season biomass can be highly profitable and, therefore, some famers attempt to start their cultivation activities before prevailing, surface seawater temperatures (SST) are optimal. However, attempting to cultivate too early, can lead to total crop failure. Young kelp sporophytes are easily destroyed between 18 and 22 degrees C SST, which can occur during the early nursery period when the materials are confined to tanks. This study investigated the growth of S. japonica thalli and photosynthetic quantum yield (F-v/F-m) under five temperatures (i.e., 18-26 degrees C, at 2 degrees increments) and five irradiances (i.e., 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80mol photons m(-2)s(-1)). This was undertaken for four different size groups of sporophyte thalli (i.e., 0.25, 1, 5, 10mm). There were different responses of the initial groups of S. japonica showing different tolerances to temperature and irradiance. In general, the smaller plants (1mm) were more tolerant of sub-optimal conditions than their larger cohorts. These results indicated the optimum temperature and irradiance ranges for different size groups of S. japonica thalli which, if adopted in management protocols, could contribute to enhanced profitability and a more stable and evenly distributed production of Saccharina raw materials over an entire annual basis.",10.1007/s10811-018-1565-4
"Chauvaud, P; Day, R; Roussel, S",No evident effect of domestication on the anti-predator behaviour of European abalone (Haliotis tuberculata): Implications for stock enhancement programs,2021,APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,244,,,,105470,"Stock-enhancement programs for the European abalone (Haliotis tuberculata) might be an efficient way to restore collapsed natural populations or preserve fishing activities. Specifically, this practice consists of releasing hatchery-reared juveniles from wild or farmed broodstock into natural environments. However, the process of selection and adaptation to farming conditions may result in domestication, thus leading to genetic and behavioural changes in farmed animals. Therefore, evaluating the effects of the domestication process on ju-veniles is a critical first step toward the development of successful abalone stock-enhancement programs. To this end, the behaviour and survival of sixteen-month-old H. tuberculata juveniles from wild and from farmed broodstock (the product of three generations of shell-length based selection) were compared. We used three assays at different spatial and temporal scales: (1) short-term responses to simulated contact with predators, (2) the activity pattern in the presence of a natural predator (the velvet crab Necora puber) in aquariums during a 2-week trial, and (3) survival in large mesocosms in the presence of predators during a 3-week trial. No significant effects of the broodstock origin of the juveniles were detected on any of the studied parameters (P 0.05). In addition, the estimated size effects were small compared to the overall mean for most of the variables, suggesting that the domestication process was too recent to induce important behavioural changes in juveniles from farmed broodstock. Introducing crabs into the mesocosms significantly decreased abalone survival rates (P < 0.05). In the activity pattern trial, most of the abalone mortality in aquariums with crabs (55%) occurred within the first three days, which was largely attributed to initial exploration of areas outside of shelters by the abalone. In the second week, abalone spent much less time moving when crabs were present (P < 0.05). These results suggest that juveniles from both origins would likely have the same survival rates if released in the wild. The commonly reported high abalone mortality immediately after seeding is likely due to a lack of hiding behaviour or exploration of the new environment during the first few days of exposure to predators in the wild. Therefore, current release systems may need to be adjusted to the ethological characteristics of abalone juveniles to avoid high mortalities due to an initial lack of predator avoidance.",10.1016/j.applanim.2021.105470

The respiratory cost of development to the six-arm larval stage (day 60) was 14.0 mJ for fed larvae and 8.2 mJ for unfed larvae. We observed three phases of metabolic regulation during development. During embryogenesis (day 0-22), increasing metabolic rates were proportional to increases in cell numbers. During early larval development (day; 22-17), the differences in respiratory rate between fed and unfed larvae were not accounted for by cell number, but by cell-specific metabolic rate (respiratory rate normalized to DNA content). Once an advanced larval stage had been reached (day 47-60), cell-specific respiratory rate and mitochondrial densities (citrate synthase activity normalized to DNA content) were more equivalent between fed and unfed larvae, suggesting that size-specific metabolic rates were determined at a level of physiological regulation that was independent of cell numbers or feeding history.",

Abalone aquaculture has experienced such losses, and thus, thermal-tolerant species are needed for mechanistic research and selective breeding programs. Hence, suitable methods to evaluate the thermal tolerance of abalone have become vitally important. In this study, a high-throughput evaluation method (heat adhesion duration, HAD) was developed based on the adhesion capacity of abalone. The stability and accuracy of the new method were verified by comparisons of survival time, Arrhenius breakpoint temperatures (ABT) of cardiac performance, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Positive correlations were found between HAD and survival time and between HAD and ABT, indicating that individuals with higher HAD were more thermal tolerant. The HAD values increased with acclimation temperature (20 degrees C, 24 degrees C) but were not affected by abalone size, age, or sex. The assessments of HAD, ABT, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated stronger thermal tolerance of the southern population (JJ) of Haliotis discus hannai compared to the northern population (DL), suggesting plasticity of abalone in thermal tolerance. In addition, the thermal resistance of five abalone species from two hybridization systems, H. discus hannai (DD), H. gigantea (GG), H. fulgens (FF), hybrid H. gigantea female x H. discus hannai male (GD), and hybrid H. discus hannai female x H. fulgens male (DF), was evaluated by HAD and ABT, confirming the existence of heterosis for thermal tolerance. The high throughput method developed in this study could provide a reliable indicator for molecular mechanism analyses and genetic selection for thermal tolerance in abalone.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737226

In the present study, two tetraspanins, CD63 and tetraspanin 33 (TSPAN33) from disk abalone (AbCD63 and AbTSPAN33), were identified and characterized at the molecular level. The coding sequences for AbCD63 and AbTSPAN33 encoded polypeptides of 234 and 290 amino acids (aa) with predicted molecular mass of 25.3 and 32.5 kDa, respectively. The deduced AbCD63 and AbTSPAN33 protein sequences were also predicted to have a typical tetraspanin domain architecture, including four transmembrane domains (TM), short N- and C- terminal regions, a short intracellular loop, as well as a large and small extracellular loop. A characteristic CCG motif and cysteine residues, which are highly conserved across CD63 and TSPAN33 proteins of different species, were present in the large extracellular loop of both abalone tetraspanins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the AbCD63 and AbTSPAN33 clustered in the invertebrate subclade of tetraspanins, thus exhibiting a close relationship with tetraspanins of other mollusks. The AbCD63 and AbTSPAN33 mRNA transcripts were detected at early embryonic development stages of disk abalone with significantly higher amounts at the trochophore stage, suggesting the involvement of these proteins in embryonic development. Both AbCD63 and AbTSPAN33 were ubiquitously expressed in all the tissues of unchallenged abalones analyzed, with the highest expression levels found in hemocytes. Moreover, significant induction of AbCD63 and AbTSPAN33 mRNA expression was observed in immunologically important tissues, such as hemocytes and gills, upon stimulation with live bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes), virus (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus), and two potent immune stimulators [polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)]. Collectively, these findings suggest that AbCD63 and AbTSPAN33 are involved in innate immune responses in disk abalone during pathogenic stress. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This observation followed blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum. No illnesses were reported, but harvesting restrictions were enforced in commercial areas. Abalone were assayed using HPLC-FLD methodology based on AOAC official method 2005.06. An uncommon congener, deoxydecarbamoyl-STX (doSTX), was observed in addition to regulated PSTs as unassigned chromatographic peaks. A quantitative reference material was prepared from contaminated Tasmanian abalone viscera and ampouled at 54.2 mu mol/L. The LD50 of doSTX via intraperitoneal injection was 1069 nmol/kg (95% confidence limits 983-1100 nmol/kg), indicating it is nearly 40 times less toxic than STX. A toxicity equivalence factor of 0.042 was generated using the mouse bioassay. Levels of PSTs varied among individuals from the same site, although the toxin profile remained relatively consistent. In the foot tissue, STX, decarbamoyl-STX and doSTX were identified. On a molar basis doSTX was the dominant congener in both foot and viscera samples. The viscera toxin profile was more complex, with other less toxic PST congeners observed and was similar to mussels from the same site. This finding implicates localised dinoflagellate blooms as the PST source in Tasmanian abalone. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.toxicon.2014.08.058

Predation specifically on juvenile intertidal invertebrates can also substantially impact population dynamics and influence community structure. The lined shore crab Pachygrapsus crassipes (Randall, 1840) is an abundant denizen of sheltered and exposed intertidal habitats in the northeast Pacific from Canada to Mexico. This study examined potential P. crassipes predation on juvenile mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), whelks [Nucella ostrina (Gould, 1852)], and abalone [Haliotis rufescens (Swainson, 1822)] due to conflicting reports on the diet of this species. Crabs consumed more juvenile mussels and abalone than seaweed (Ulva lactuca) and fed preferentially on the smallest mussels (6- to 10-mm size class). Further experiments showed that predation on mussels by P. crassipes was highly size dependent, with the largest crabs consuming over twenty-five 15-mm mussels per day. Field outplant experiments revealed that P. crassipes consumed high numbers of juvenile mussels in a natural setting, meaning that it could substantially affect mussel recruitment. This crab species appears to be an opportunistic predator that could have significant impacts on the recruitment and early life history of several invertebrate prey species.",10.2983/035.036.0122

The disk abalone SOCS-2 cDNA (AbSOCS-2) contains 1700-bp full length with 771-bp coding sequence, which codes 257 amino acids protein. Based on the sequence analysis results, AbSOCS-2 showed characteristic SH2 domain and SOCS box similar to vertebrate SOCS counterparts. Additionally, 3' UTR of the AbSOCS-2 contained two RNA instability motifs (ATITA). Quantitative real-time PCR expression results showed that AbSOCS-2 was constitutively expressed in all examined tissues of healthy abalone showing tissue specific variation. AbSOCS-2 mRNA expression was induced significantly (p < 0.05) by bacteria mixture containing Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahemolyticus, and Listeria monocytogenes in abalone gill at 3 h post-induction (p.i.). Furthermore, AbSOC-2 mRNA was significantly (p < 0.05) induced by Viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatments in abalone gill.

Abalone is a shellfish that feeds on kelp and as a product, can often render high market value. In this study, the development of a commercial-size, submersible abalone cage grow-out system with a modular box structure is described. The flow field characteristics within the abalone containment structure were analyzed with computational fluid dynamic software. The hydrodynamic response of the moored containment structure was investigated with a Morison equation type finite element model that simulates fluid-structure interaction. Environmental forcing input to the model consisted of loading conditions representing combinations of currents with a magnitude of 1.0 m/s and irregular seas with a significant wave height of 8.01 m and peak period of 12.52 s. Simulations were performed with the abalone cage model in both surface and submerged configurations. From the simulations, the attachment loads were determined and used in a structural model to calculate local stresses. Structural analysis of the deployment and recovery operation was also investigated. The results indicate the importance of including a combination of detailed structural/hydrodynamic/flow analyses into the design framework to avoid catastrophic failures of abalone farming systems.

During industrial processing, the viscera, which are abundant of cellulase, are usually discarded or processed into low-value feedstuff. Thus, it is of interest to obtain cellulase fromabalone viscera and investigate its application for preparation of functional oligosaccharides. RESULTS: A cellulase was purified from the hepatopancreas of abalone by ammonium sulfate precipitation and two-steps column chromatography. The molecular weight of the cellulase was 45 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Peptidemass fingerprinting analysis yielded 103 amino acid residues, which were identical to cellulases from other species of abalone. Substrate specificity analysis indicated that the cellulase is an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase. Hydrolysis of seaweed Porphyra haitanensis polysaccharides by the enzyme produced oligosaccharides with degree of polymerisation of two to four, whose monosaccharide composition was 58% galactose, 4% glucose and 38% xylose. The oligosaccharides revealed 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical as well as hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity.

The Ulva serves as a biofilter and the co-produced Ulva is often used as feed for the abalone. To better understand the potential benefits and risks associated with this practice, this study characterised the bacterial microbiome associated with the seawater and Ulva raceways receiving abalone effluent (IMTA system) and compared this to Ulva tanks supplied with fertilised seawater (non-IMTA; control). Ulva samples were collected from each Ulva system, and water samples were collected at the inlet and outlet of each system. Bacterial communities were assessed using a culture-based approach and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the V3-V4 16S rDNA region. It was observed that Ulva has the potential to reduce the bacterial load of abalone effluent, with the total number of potential culturable Vibrio species declining from 150x10(3) cells mL(-1) in the inlet to 37x10(3) cells mL(-1) in the outlet of the Ulva system. The NGS dataset supported these findings, with a reduction observed in Vibrio and Pseudoalteromonas from the inlet to outlet samples. A lower number of genera (p < 0.05) were observed on Ulva when compared with water samples, indicating that Ulva has a beneficial, modulatory effect on bacteria. These findings contribute towards the growing body of evidence for the benefits of seaweeds in IMTA and addresses the biosecurity concerns of abalone farmers wishing to improve the circularity of their farming activities by incorporating seaweeds.",10.1007/s10811-024-03298-8

We also visually confirmed apoptotic effects of different water temperatures and pH levels via in situ hybridization and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assays. The levels of H2O2, MDA, SOD, CAT, and caspase-3 increased under low/high water temperature and/or low pH conditions. Expression of the genes was high under high temperature and low pH conditions. Additionally, the apoptotic rate was high under high temperatures and low pH conditions.

Results showed also that peak intensities of amino acids used as biomarker of anaerobiosis in molluscs are time and dose dependent. In the opposite, phosphoarginine and ATP level are dependent to Roundup (R) concentration rather than to the time of exposure.

We investigated the relationship between abalone resources and quantitative or qualitative changes of algal beds in coastal waters around the Ojika Islands, Nagasaki Prefecture, southwestern Japan, from 1988 to 2011. During this period, the catch record of 2 abalone species-Haliotis discus discus and Haliotis gigantea-was examined, and the composition and abundance of macroalgae around the Ojika Islands was observed. The annual landing of abalone has decreased steadily from 91 mt in 1987 to 0.4 mt in 2011. The proportion of H. discus discus to the annual abalone landing has also changed; it was stable (30% 60%) between 1988 and 2000, less than 20% from 2004 to 2005, and increased from 2006, reaching more than 90% in 2010. The macroalgal beds have also changed during this period. The perennial Laminariales beds, consisting of Eisenia bicyclis and Ecklonia spp., had disappeared by 2003, shifting mostly to Sargassaceae (Sargassum macrocarpum) beds. After the Sargassaceae beds had disappeared by 2009, there have been no Laminariales or Sargassaceae beds except for spring algal beds (unusual perennial Sargassaceae beds that form dense stands from March to July and lose most thalli after maturing in August) in some fishing ports. The results suggest a differential detrimental effect of the disappearance of macroalgal beds on abalone, with different species having different effects. After 2009, when no perennial Laminariales or Sargassaceae beds were present, there were no mature individuals of H. gigantea, with no recruitment at the juvenile stage of the latter at major fishing grounds. Reformation of the macroalgal beds is indispensable to sustain or restore the H. gigantea population.

A control experiment was conducted to confirm the reported positive effect of sand as a substrate on sandfish growth and a sand-in-diet experiment was conducted to determine if the incorporation of sand into formulated diets could improve sandfish growth in bare tanks. In the control experiment, the mean growth rate of juvenile sandfish in the bare tanks was significantly lower than that of the juveniles reared in tanks with a sand substrate (-0.12 +/- 0.16 g day(-1) SE and 0.03 +/- 0.01 g day(-1) respectively; F-(1,F-2)=1.91, p<0.001). However in the sand-in-diet experiment, the mean growth rate of juvenile sandfish in bare tanks, fed a formulated diet containing 20% sand was not significantly different to juveniles fed a standard formulated diet (-0.13 +/- 0.01 and -0.12 +/- 0.16 g day(-1) respectively; F-(1,F-2)=1.26, p>0.05). Results confirmed the reported positive effect on sandfish growth when sand is provided as a substrate, however sand in diets did not promote growth in the same way, indicating that the inclusion of sand in formulated diets is unlikely to compensate for the lack of sand as a substrate.
