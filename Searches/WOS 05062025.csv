HaHV-1-challenged paua up-regulated broad classes of genes that contained chitin-binding peritrophin-A domains, which seem to play diverse roles in the paua immune response. The paua also up-regulated vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1), an important adhesion molecule for lymphocytes, and chitotriosidase- 1 (CHIT-1), an immunologically important gene in mammalian immune systems. Moreover, several blood coagulation pathways were dysregulated in the paua, possibly indicating viral modulation. We also saw several indications that neurological tissues were specifically affected by HaHV-1, including the dysregulation of beta-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (B4GALNT), GM2 ganglioside, neuroligin-4 and the Notch signalling pathway.

"Allen, VJ; Marsden, ID; Ragg, NLC; Gieseg, S","The effects of tactile stimulants on feeding, growth, behaviour, and meat quality of cultured Blackfoot abalone, Haliotis iris",2006,AQUACULTURE,257,1-Apr,294,308,,"The New Zealand Blackfoot abalone or paua, Haliotis iris uses both tactile and chemosensory cues to detect and feed on drifting seaweed in its natural habitat. In aquaculture situations, abalone are usually provided with static artificial food pellets, effectively removing the tactile stimulus. This study investigated the effects of tactile stimuli from suspended particles on pellet ingestion, growth, behaviour and meat quality of juvenile paua (length 40-45 mm). Over eleven months, individuals were offered a commercial pellet diet (AbFeed (TM)) and small quantities of one of four particulate materials: macerated seaweed (Gracilaria spp. and Macrocystis pyrifera) and 2 sizes of synthetic PVC fragments. There was seasonal variation in the ingestion rate of abalone from all treatments and the control (no stimulants) with lowest rates during winter (June to September) and highest rates in summer (December to February). The specific growth rate (% body weight gain per day) and shell length increase varied seasonally. Of the four treatments, the only effective stimulant was Gracilaria spp. which resulted in summer shell growth of 110.6 +/- 3.2 pm d(-1) compared with 86.9 +/- 4.0 pm d(-1) for control abalone. Behavioural observations showed that when Gracilaria particles were present, abalone spent > 80% of their time engaged in feeding-related activity. Control abalone, without the algal stimulant, spent most of their time in a sedentary position. None of the particulate stimulants tested had any significant effect on food conversion ratio, water content, protein, lipid and glycogen levels or meat tenderness. These parameters were, however, significantly affected by season. A preliminary trial of the Gracilaria particle treatment in a commercial system over 90 days enhanced the growth of cultured H. iris (45 +/- 5 min shell length) by 15.3%. The main commercial implication of this research is that the addition of algal stimulants is suggested as a cost-effective means of improving abalone performance using pre-existing culture systems and food types.

In this study, survival rates of the abalone, Haliotis diversicolor supertexta, against Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and its non-specific immune parameters such as the total haemocyte count (THC), phenoloxidase (PO) activity, respiratory bursts, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, phagocytic activity, and clearance efficiency to V. parahaemolyticus by H. diversicolor supertexta were determined when abalone (4.5 +/- 0.4 g) were fed diets containing sodium alginate at 0, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 g kg(-1). Abalone fed a diet containing sodium alginate at 2.0 and 3.0 g kg(-1) for 14 days and at 1.0 g kg(-1) for 21 days had significantly higher survival rates than those fed the control diet after challenge with V. parahaemolyticus. The relative survival percentages of abalone fed the 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 g kg(-1) sodium alginate-containing diets for 14 and 21 days were 16.1%, 40.0%, and 48.0%, and 63.6%, 27.3% and 22.6%, respectively. The PO activity, respiratory bursts, SOD activity, and phagocytic activity and clearance efficiency of V. parahaemolyticus of abalone fed the sodium alginate-containing diets at 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 g kg(-1) were significantly higher than those of abalone fed the control diet for 14 days. After 21 days, the PO activity, respiratory bursts, SOD activity, and phagocytic activity and clearance efficiency of V. parahaemolyticus by abalone fed the sodium alginate-containing diet at 1.0 g kg(-1) were significantly higher than those of abalone fed the other diets. It was concluded that sodium alginate can be used as an immunostimulant for abalone through dietary administration to enhance immune responses of abalone and resistance against V. parahaemolyticus, which were related to the dose and timing of administration.

The experiment included 10 diet treatments with two replicates each (n = 50 individuals per replicate). The first five diet treatments comprised four fishmeal-based formulated feeds: Abfeed (R), Adam & Amose (R) 'a', Adam & Amos (R) 'b' and Adam & Amos (R) 'c'; and an all-seaweed -based formulated pellet, FeedX. The additional five diet treatments comprised the formulated feeds above, supplemented with fresh wild seaweeds: the kelp Ecklonia maxima (5-15% protein) and Ulva lactuca (3.7-19.9% protein).

Six semi-purified diets containing graded levels of dietary copper (1.08, 3.76, 6.54, 14.80, 26.84 and 109.41 mg/kg diet) from CuSO4 center dot 5H(2)O were fed to juvenile abalone (initial shell length: 17.21 +/- 0.04 mm; initial body weight: 0.65 +/- 0.00 g) in triplicate groups for 24 weeks in a flow-through system. The results showed that no significant (P>0.05) differences were found in weight gain rate (WGR, %), daily increment in shell length (DISL mu m/day) and survival among the dietary treatments. However, Cu concentrations in abalone serum, hepatopancreas, muscle and newly grown shell showed a clear increasing trend with the supplementation of dietary Cu, and the concentrations were significantly (P<0.05) higher in abalone fed dietary Cu >= 26.84 mg/kg compared to those fed 1.08 mg Cu/kg. The crude lipid in abalone carcass decreased with increasing dietary Cu and was significantly (P<0.05) lower in abalone fed dietary Cu 26.84 mg/kg compared to the rest of the treatments. The activities of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn SOD) in the hepatopancreas and serum were significantly increased when supplementation of dietary Cu reached 3.76 mg/kg diet, and 6.54 mg/kg diet provided maximum activity of serum phenoloxidase (PO). There was no significant difference for these enzyme activities when dietary Cu was over those values. The optimum requirement of juvenile abalone for dietary Cu was estimated to be 3-5 mg/kg diet by broken-line regression analysis, based on the activities of CuZn SOD and PO either in abalone hepatopancreas or serum. Deficiency of dietary Cu significantly depressed the immune responses in abalone. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We tested 13 different types of feed, each with varying amounts of three carotenoids: astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and beta-carotene. These feeds were given to two types of abalones: those with common (pale yellow) and orange-colored foot muscles. The study found that all abalones, regardless of the carotenoid levels in their diet, had a survival rate of about 70-80%. This suggests that these added nutrients do not significantly change their survival chances. Interestingly, when exposed to heat, the common-footed abalones were able to stay attached longer than the orange-footed ones, indicating that they might benefit more from the added nutrients. In addition, both types showed similar resistance to bacterial infection. Our findings highlight the potential of using carotenoid-enriched diets in aquaculture to improve the health and resilience of abalones, offering insights for developing better feeds for these valuable sea creatures. Carotenoids, known to enhance survival, heat tolerance, and bacterial resistance, play an essential role in the nutrition of economically important aquatic animals. This study specifically examined their impact as feed additives on the abalone Haliotis gigantea. We prepared 13 compound feeds with varying levels of astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and beta-carotene, and administered them to both common-footed and orange-footed H. gigantea. The survival rate of H. gigantea was about 70-80%, with no significant differences in survival observed among the various carotenoid-supplemented feeding groups or when compared with the control group, nor between orange-footed and common-footed individuals. In heat attachment duration experiments, orange-foot abalones exhibited longer attachment durations with certain concentrations of astaxanthin and zeaxanthin, whereas common-foot abalones showed extended durations with astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and beta-carotene, indicating that common-foot abalones might benefit more from these carotenoids. Additionally, our results showed similar patterns and levels of Vibrio harveyi AP37 resistance in both orange-footed and common-footed H. gigantea, suggesting a uniform response to carotenoid supplementation in their bacterial defense mechanisms. This study suggests the potential benefits of carotenoid supplementation in H. gigantea and contributes to the theoretical basis for developing high-quality artificial compound feeds.",10.3390/ani14020180,,2076-2615,,,JAN,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani14020180,38254350

Dietary inclusion effect of citrus peel by-product (CPB) as an additive on the growth, body composition, and various stress resistance of juvenile abalone (Haliotis discus) was investigated, and compared to commercial antioxidant (ethoxyquin). A total of 2880 juvenile (initial weight of 3.3 g) abalone were randomly assigned into 24 net cages. Seven formulated diets supplemented with 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50 g/kg CPB and 0.01 g/kg ethoxyquin were formulated, and referred to as the CPB0, CPB5, CPB10, CPB20, CPB30, CPB50, and EQ diets, respectively. Finally, dry Saccharina japonica was prepared to compare the formulated diets on growth of abalone. All experimental diets were assigned to triplicate groups of abalone. Abalone were daily fed to satiation for 16 weeks. After the 16-week feeding trial, sixty abalone from each cage were subjected to the 20-h air, 12-h low salinity at 25 psu, and 20-h high temperature at 30 degrees C exposure stressors, respectively, and then survival was monitored. Abalone fed all formulated diets produced superior weight gain, specific growth rate (SGR), shell growth to abalone fed the S. japonica. Dietary inclusion levels of CPB linearly improved weight gain of abalone. However, there was no difference in chemical composition of the soft body of abalone fed all experimental diets. Diets supplemented with CPB or EQ improved survival of abalone when subjected to the 20-h air and high temperature exposures.

H. discus hannai (shell length: 32.75 +/- 2.63 mm, body weight: 4.91 +/- 0.34 g) was selected to perform a 70 d laboratory culture experiment including a 14 d V. parahaemolyticus artificial infection experiment. The control group (C) was fed normal commercial feed every day. The M1 experimental group was given experimental feed and basal feed on alternating days until the end of the experiment.

Four different diets (commercial chip, experimental flake, Ulva sp. and Gracilaria cliftonii) at two feeding rations (excess vs. restricted) were tested. Diet type had no effect on abalone movement, but macroalgal diets resulted in higher feed intakes. Restricting feed rations induced greater movement. Abalone moved little during the light period and moved mostly during darkness, except for animals on the restricted feed ration where feeding commenced during the light period. On farms, this phenomenon may be a useful behavioural indicator for identifying underfed abalone. Despite their lower intake, formulated diets promoted higher energy and nutritional intake, indicating that quantity of feed consumed is not solely indicative of nutritional gain.

In this research we develop and analyse a matrix population model for the New Zealand blackfoot paua (abalone) Haliotis iris. Preliminary calculations for one population of H. iris yielded a population growth rate (PGR) of 16%. However due to uncertain parameter values we trialled larval settlement rates that resulted in population growth rates (PGRs) from 0 to 17%. The results showed that specific knowledge about settlement rate and juvenile survival was unimportant for the relative influence of these life-history parameters on this deterministic matrix model. Survival of the larger adults consistently had the highest sensitivity and elasticity, however in a rapidly growing population survival of the smaller animals gained importance. Also, the somewhat arbitrary placement of the shell length division between the two classes of adults created changes, with larger classes having higher elasticities. In addition elasticity, (indicating effect on the population growth rate) was concentrated in the older adults. However sensitivity, (with its greater emphasis on evolutionary change) placed more emphasis on slightly younger adults. These findings suggest that survival of larger adult paua, which is the stage typically targeted for harvest, is a key factor in fishery productivity, restoration, and conservation of the species.

Inclusion levels of 0.0 (commercial control diet), 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, and 4.0% OS were added into a commercial feed formulation and diets were fed to 3-y-old greenlip abalone (67.98 g, 77.01 mm shell length) at two water temperatures (22 degrees C and 25 degrees C) for 47 days. Survival and immune parameters including phagocytic activity, total hemocyte count (THC), and activities of the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were measured. Survival was high at 22 degrees C with no significant differences in mortality between treatments.

This review assesses the impact of E. maxima supplementation on fish growth performance and feed utilization, considering factors like dietary inclusion levels and species-specific responses. Findings suggest that E. maxima supplementation positively influences growth parameters and feed efficiency in various fish species, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional feed additives. However, further research is needed to optimize supplementation protocols and elucidate underlying mechanisms. Leveraging marine resources can help the industry adopt more environmentally responsible practices while ensuring continued growth and prosperity. Overall, this review emphasizes the significance of E. maxima as a sustainable feed supplement in aquaculture, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where the region's particular environmental challenges must be addressed while production is increased due to the growing demand for fish farming.

Ln two growth trials the effect of temperature and abalone size on growth rate and nutritional indices of abalone fed a dry formulated diet was quantified. Between 12 and 20 degrees C growth rate and feed consumption increased, protein-efficiency ratio (PER) improved and FCR did not differ significantly. However, between 20 and 24 degrees C, growth and feed consumption declined sharply, and PER and FCR deteriorated. The condition factor of abalone decreased with increasing temperature. It was concluded that temperatures between 12 and 20 degrees C are physiologically optimal for H. midae. This range corresponds to the mean sea temperature range experienced by H. midae within its natural range, Feed consumption, expressed as a percentage of body weight per day, decreased with increasing abalone size. A model which predicts feed consumption as a function of temperature, shell length and feed-conversion ratio was developed.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of Spirulina powder-supplemented feeds on abalone growth after 93 days and 125 days of culture. Spirulina particles were attached to the surfaces of abalone feed granules by mixing to prepare Spirulina powder-supplemented abalone feeds. The morphology, components, and thermal stability of the granules were analyzed. Abalone body weight and shell characteristics (size, pigmentation, morphology, and components) were also assessed for evaluating abalone growth. Protein expression patterns in abalones were monitored. Spirulina particles were detected on the surfaces of Spirulina powder-supplemented abalone feed granules, which were not modified in size and shape after attachment. The Spirulina powder-supplemented feed granules included organic materials and minerals based on C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, and Ca. They were thermally stable up to 20 degrees C. Abalones fed Spirulina powder-supplement at 0.7 % showed significantly increased body weight and shell size after 125-day culture. Shell pigmentation and morphology were also improved. The shell contained C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, and Fe. Abalone proteins were clearly expressed at 75-100 kD and 150-250 kD. These results suggest that Spirulina powder has a promising potential as a feed supplement to be used in next-generation animal feeds for enhanced growth.

The algae Macrocystis pyrifera, Gracilaria chilensis, and Sarcothalia crispata were administered as mixed diets, mono diets, or in rotation changing weekly. Additionally, an artificial pellet feed (ABfeed) was administered alone using a feeder or as part of a mixed diet. The experiment lasted 10 mo. The 100% S. crispata diet was suspended after 4 mo due to low survival rates (92.1% +/- 3.4%). Treatments had significant effects (P <0.05) on survival, growth, food consumption, and conversion factor. The lowest survival rate was obtained using the artificial feed with a feeder (94.2% +/- 4.3%) and the highest with a mix of.11. pyrifera and artificial feed (99.0% +/- 0.8%).

Understanding the nocturnal feeding patterns of abalone is fundamental to feed management and productive abalone farming. In this study, the apparent feed consumption for greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) and hybrid abalone (H. laevigata x Haliotis rubra) fed fresh Ulva sp. or a commercial formulated diet at 18 degrees C or 22 degrees C were investigated at night. Abalone were exposed to low light intensity (3.4 Lux) from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM and darkness from 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM.

Abalone consumed Ulva sp. at a linear rate from 4:00 PM to 8:00 AM. In contrast, the apparent feed consumption rate of abalone fed the formulated diet was minimal from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM, and was highest between 7:00 PM and 1:00 AM. Apparent feed consumption rate of abalone significantly increased as water temperature increased from 18 degrees C to 22 degrees C, but the effect was greater for hybrid abalone compared with greenlip abalone. The total apparent feed intake of both greenlip and hybrid abalone fed Ulva sp. was significantly greater than for both types of abalone fed the formulated diet. The total apparent feed intake on dry basis, and nutrient intake for abalone fed Ulva sp. was significantly lower than for abalone fed the formulated diet.

Furthermore, a low level of haemocytes with reactive oxygen species (ROS) was found associated with the optimal diet (13.24 +/- 4.2%). A total of 31 differently regulated metabolites across the four treatments were revealed with a characteristic enhancement of free amino acids in the samples obtained from abalone fed with the optimal diet.

"Kemp, JOG; Britz, PJ; Agüero, PHT","The effect of macroalgal, formulated and combination diets on growth, survival and feed utilisation in the red abalone Haliotis rufescens",2015,AQUACULTURE,448,,306,314,,"Abalone aquaculture in Chile is dominated by production of the red abalone Haliotis rufescens using a diet comprised predominantly of fresh, wild-harvested macroalgae. Concerns over the long-term supply of macroalgae have led farmers to investigate the suitability of various formulated feeds, however there has been limited commercial adoption. Combination diets of macroalgal and formulated feed fed together provide a mechanism to explore and adapt to formulated feed use without entirely abandoning macroalgal feed. The current study evaluated the use of formulated, macroalgal and two combination diets (low and high macroalgal supplementation) on production indicators and canning yields of juvenile abalone H. rufescens in a culture system modified for formulated feed. The macroalgal diet and the high macroalgal-formulated pellet combination diet (76.1% macroalgae: 23.9% pelleted diet as dry weight) produced significantly higher growth indicators (SGR and LGR) than the low macroalgal-formulated pellet combination diet (31.6% macroalgae: 68.4% pelleted diet as dry weight) and the formulated pellet diet. The protein efficiency ratio of the experimental treatments was positively related to the proportional contribution of fresh macroalgae in the diet. Furthermore, calculation of the protein efficiency ratio of the formulated component in combination diets (PERf) revealed a significant positive relationship between macroalgae contribution and PERf. This suggests that the increase in total PER is driven by the increased utilisation of protein in the formulated component of combination diets associated with increasing levels of fresh macroalgal supplementation. We suggest possible reasons why the presence of seaweed increased the availability of the formulated feed protein to the abalone. A simulated canning trial highlighted a significant positive linear relationship between meat canning yield and the proportional contribution of formulated feed. This study highlights the value of combination diets as a tool for abalone producers to harness the potential production advantages of macroalgae while still accessing the processing benefits associated with nutrient dense formulated feed. Statement of relevance: We believe that this manuscript describes novel insights into the efficiency of protein utilisation in juvenile red abalone fed combination diets as well as the effect of diet, particularly formulated feed inclusion level, on canned meat yields. This provides empirical information to inform commercial abalone farmers of H. rufescens when exploring dietary options for optimal culture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Limitations on the availability and use of fish meal through EU directives (EC Regulation 999/2001 & EC Regulation 183/2005) are focussing research efforts to find alternative sources of protein for aquaculture feeds. Marine algae, although low in protein, are widely being considered as a potential alternative to fish meal as not only do they have the potential to impart additional health benefits when ingested but they can also be cultured under enrichment conditions to enhance their nutritional profile as a feed additive. For abalone (a marine gastropod mollusc), several studies have highlighted the benefits of a diet of fresh mixed species seaweed for cultivation. However, the performance of a mixed species marine algae meal, consisting of Laminaria digitata meal, Palmaria palmata meal and Ulva lactuca meal, in a formulated diet for abalone has not apparently been investigated. In this study, the performance of five novel, isonitrogenous, konjac glucomannan-xanthan gum (KX) bound feeds for the abalone Haliotis discus hannai were evaluated in a 12-week experimental growth trial. Comparisons were made between a basal diet formulation (Diet A), a basal diet + lipids + choline chloride (Diet B) and diets containing mixed seaweed meal (Diet C) or fish meal (Diet D) or mixed seaweed meal + fish meal (Diet E). Freshly harvested L. digitata was included as a natural feed type and experimental control. Dry matter leaching was assessed and no significant differences in the dry matter loss over 3 and 4 days were observed between the experimental KX feeds, although L. digitata was a significantly more sea water stable feed type. Daily food consumption (DFC) of Diet C and Diet E was significantly lower than that of fresh L. digitata and the DFC of Diet D was significantly higher than that of L. digitata. Diet E had significantly higher food conversion efficiency than L. digitata, Diet A, Diet B and Diet D. There was no difference in the protein efficiency ratio (PER) between the formulated diets but the PER of Diet D was significantly different to L. digitata. L. digitata had significantly higher linear growth rates than Diet B, and significant differences in the specific growth rates were observed between Diet A and Diet D only. No significant differences in body weight to shell length ratios and percentage survival between treatments were observed.

This is the basis of least-cost linear computer programs. However, experiments conducted on pigs and rats have revealed that the inclusion of dietary fiber in manufactured feeds may result in a depression of the digestibility coefficients of the constituent ingredients. Thus, feeds that are formulated by adding the digestibility coefficients of each constituent ingredient, derived by the direct measurement of the digestibility of each ingredient when incorporated into base diets, may lead to an overestimation of the digestibility of nutrients in the manufactured feed. A series of isonitrogenous diets containing semolina, fishmeal, barley, lupin kernel meal, and various combinations of these ingredients were fed to juvenile greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) to determine the apparent fecal digestibilities of N, amino acids, and gross energy. The digestibility coefficients of the single-ingredient diets were used to predict the digestibility of N, amino acids, and gross energy in casein in the mixed diets. The calculated digestibility values for casein did not differ significantly between diets. Thus, the apparent fecal digestibilities of N, amino acids, and gross energy of the constituent ingredients were not affected by varying ingredient combinations in the diets. Apparent fecal digestibility values for the chosen ingredients are additive when they are incorporated into compound feeds for abalone and so are good descriptors of nutritive value and can be used with confidence in diet formulations.",,"Fleming, Ann/0000-0001-8310-8030",0730-8000,,,DEC,,

Two size classes (25-30 and 65-70 mm) of Haliotis midae were fed diets with graded levels of lipid (4-16%), in which total protein varied (34-39%) to maintain a constant P: E (22 g protein MJ(-1)). For both size classes, overall performance was best on diets containing 4% and 7% lipid. Above 7% lipid, specific growth rate, shell length increment and protein efficiency ratio decreased while feed consumption and FCR increased significantly. The observed deterioration in growth and nutritional performance in diets with > 7% dietary lipid was more marked in the 65-70 mm size class than in the 25-30 mm class, indicating that the smaller size class were better equipped to metabolize higher levels of dietary lipid. We concluded that the observed decrease in growth and feed utlization with the increasing dietary lipid was not due to an imbalance of dietary protein relative to energy, but rather that H. midae is unable to effectively utilize lipids as an energy source at levels in excess of 7% due to inherent physiological constraints.",10.1111/j.1365-2109.2010.02742.x,"Jones, Clifford/0000-0001-8394-1890; Britz, Peter/0000-0002-4436-0425",1355-557X,,,SEP,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2010.02742.x,

Host immune responses in haemocytes were characterized using flow cytometry by measuring total haemocyte counts (THC) and viability, degree of apoptosis, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 48 h post-challenge. Probiotic-fed abalone had significantly higher survival rates compared to control animals after the bacterial challenge. Infected probiotic-fed abalone also had significantly higher haemocyte viabilities, slightly lower proportions of haemocytes undergoing early apoptosis, and lower proportions of ROS-producing haemocytes compared to infected control-fed abalone.

Serial depletion of paua (abalone, Haliotis iris), a cultural keystone for Maori in Aotearoa New Zealand, threatens Indigenous practices and values.

Regulations introduced by the East Otago Taiapure, a customary fishery management area established in 1999, recognise Indigenous rights to access and manage marine resources. Despite concerted efforts to rebuild paua populations while allowing fishing, paua have continued to decline and the fishery was closed in 2019. A wealth of matauranga (Maori knowledge) surrounds enhancement practices for paw. Here, matauranga relating to translocation was collated through interviews and applied, in conjunction with additional knowledge bases, to translocate palm from reefs threatened by sand inundation to more accessible but historically overexploited bays. In total, 420 paw, translocated across 21 sites, were monitored for a 2-week period, after which aggregations returned to pretranslocation densities. Total mortality reached 8.8% over this time, attributed primarily to predation by the sea star Astrostole scabra. Results suggest that translocation may not be suitable for creating artificial aggregations using the methods applied; however, it could address other management concerns, hence suggestions are made for methodological improvements.

This study aims to (i) investigate the effect of nutrient enrichment (non-enriched and enriched) and fresh macroalgae type (Ulva sp., Gracilaria cliftonii, and an equal combination of Ulva sp. and G. cliftonii) on the growth and feed utilisation of greenlip abalone and (ii) compare the performance of abalone fed fresh macroalgae to those separately fed either one of the three commercial formulated diets. Abalone were fed to excess at 16:00 h daily, and uneaten feed was collected the following morning. Nutrient enrichment increased the protein level for Ulva sp. and G. cliftonii from 5.3 to 27.7% and 12.9 to 38.1%, respectively. The growth of abalone fed G. cliftonii was superior to animals fed Ulva sp. The effect of enrichment was macroalgae species-dependent. While abalone fed enriched Ulva sp. exhibited superior growth to those fed non-enriched Ulva sp., animals fed non-enriched and enriched G. cliftonii exhibited similar growth. However, abalone fed non-enriched G. cliftonii had superior apparent protein deposition and protein efficiency ratio, compared to animals fed enriched G. cliftonii. Feeding an equal mix of Ulva sp. and G. cliftonii had a positive synergistic effect on abalone growth, compared to animals fed mono-specific algae. Abalone fed each commercial diet exhibited improved growth and feed utilisation compared to animals fed fresh macroalgae. The results of the current study suggest that the use of fresh G. cliftonii as a source of carbohydrates may spare protein when feeding formulated diets to abalone. When formulated diets are unavailable or are inappropriate to feed abalone, a mix of enriched Ulva sp. and G. cliftonii may be used. However, feeding fresh macroalgae alone to cultured greenlip abalone should be avoided, if growth is the parameter of interest and we recommend that commercial formulated diets be fed to cultured greenlip abalone.

A total of 400 tenmonth-old Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) were randomly sampled. To evaluate feed efficiency traits, each abalone was cultured for 72 days using the previously established single-individual system. After that, the FER was ranked after removing outliers, the top and bottom 150 individuals were exposed to different durations of fasting stress (3, 7, 10, 14, and 21 days), which was followed by single-individual re-feeding treatments. The fluctuations in body weight of each abalone during this process were recorded. The difference in the ability to cope with fasting stress and re-feed between the high- and low-FER (feed efficiency ratio) groups was analyzed. The findings demonstrated that the specific weight loss rate (SWLR) of the high- and low-FER groups of Pacific abalone differed after varying durations of fasting. The results of the correlation analysis between FER and weight change index showed that SWLR was negatively correlated with FER during stress, and the correlation of the 7-day fasting group (S7) was the highest (r = -0.71). The rapid growth stage during re-feeding was positively correlated with FER, and the correlation between the body weight gain (BWG) of days 14-28 and FER in the 10-day fasting group (S10) was the highest (r = 0.79). The results indicate that there is significant variation in the capacity of abalone to resist fasting stress and re-feeding, and this is associated with feed efficiency.

While there is a dearth of comprehensive investigation into the effects of these feeding patterns on the temporal dynamics of enzyme activity, and intestinal microbiome of abalone. In this study, a total of 3600 juvenile Pacific abalones were allocated to 12 tanks, randomly divided into four groups based on the feeding patterns: fresh kelp (labeled as FK), salted kelp (SK), formulated feed (FF), and starved group (S). After a 60-day feeding trial, the results showed that abalone in the FK, SK, and FF groups exhibited significant positive effects on both weight and shell growth compared to the S group (P<0.05). Notably, the FF group displayed the highest values of the growth performance. The activity of digestive enzymes and antioxidant enzymes in the FF group had an up-regulated trend over the course of feeding trial, whereas amylase and lipase activity in abalone declined along with starvation. Moreover, the microbial Shannon index showed an overall decreasing trend over time in the FF, FK, and SK groups except for the S group. The ANOSIM analysis revealed that both feeding pattern and cultivating time significantly influenced the structure of the microbial communities. Across the feeding trial, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteriota, and Firmicutes were identified as the dominant phyla in the intestinal microbiome of abalone under different feeding patterns. The core genera were Psychrilyobacter, Mycoplasma, and Vibrio. Additionally, the neutral model analysis revealed that stochastic processes both play a key role in shaping the assembly of microbial communities in different feeding patterns.

Abalone larvae settle on coralline algae, some diatoms films, and conspecific mucous trails. These substrata provide a wide range of potential food sources, which are used in different ways as postlarvae develop. We identify three major transitions in feeding and growth: (1) at metamorphosis, a shift from lecithotrophy/dissolved organic matter (DOM) absorption to particle feeding, with an overlap in nutrition sources; (2) at about 600-800 mu m shelf length (SL), postlarvae become responsive to the digestibility'' of diatom diets and grow more rapidly on efficiently digested strains; (3) at around 5-10 mm SL juveniles shift from a biofilm-dominated diet to a macroalgae-dominated diet. We can make some tentative generalizations about growth rates of postlarvae fed ingestible diatoms. Rapid growth (20-30 mu m/day) in the first 10 days postsettlement often falls to 10-20 mu m/day in the following 1-2 wk, perhaps reflecting the exhaustion of nutrition from yolk/DOM. Postlarvae of 0.8-2 mm SL grow similar to 40-60 mu m/day on digestible diatoms and 15-30 mu m/day on indigestible ones. Rapidly growing juveniles over 3 mm SL will grow at 100 mu m/day or more, whereas poor diets can halve these growth rates. Growth rates of individual abalone will vary widely on both good and poor diets. Diatoms that are emerging as key species for abalone culture include Cylindrotheca closterium land needle-shaped Nitzschia spp.), Cocconeis spp., and Achnanthes spp., but caution is needed in extrapolating from the limited data avilable. Hatcheries need to maintain a suitable quantity of ingestible food as well as consider food quality.

Diets were formulated to be isoenergetic (12.5 MJ kg(-1) digestible energy), containing a lipid level of similar to 3.6% and digestible protein from 17.99 to 28.57%. Abalone were fed to excess at 16:00 h daily, and uneaten feed was collected the following day. The specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone improved significantly as water temperatures increased from 14 to 17 to 20 degrees C. In addition, apparent protein deposition was significantly higher in abalone at 17 and 20 degrees C compared to abalone at 14 degrees C. There was no significant effect of dietary protein level on SGR, but faster growing abalone at 20 degrees C compensated by consuming more feed when fed low dietary protein levels. In contrast, a significant positive relationship was observed between dietary protein level and feed consumption rate in slower growing abalone at 14 and 17 degrees C. A nonsignificant tendency for the apparent feed conversion ratio (FCR) to improve was observed in abalone fed high protein diets at 20 degrees C, while at 14 degrees C, abalone had a significantly poorer FCR, especially when fed high dietary protein levels. Based on results from the current study, it is plausible to heat land-based nursery systems in order to gain accelerated growth of juveniles before transfer to grow-out systems. Additionally, no benefits were apparent by feeding abalone high protein diets at 14 or 17 degrees C, and we therefore recommend a dietary protein level of 29% CP at 14 and 17 degrees C. While the SGR of abalone at 20 degrees C was not significantly influenced by dietary protein, the feed consumption rate decreased and there was a tendency for FCR to improve as dietary protein level increased.

Seaweeds were reared in a biofiltration unit with fishpond waste water effluents. The three algal species were found to contain high protein contents which would be related to its production under the high nitrogen culture conditions of the biofilter system. Protein and carbohydrate contents were highest in H. musciformis and lowest in G. cornea. Survival rates of juvenile abalone were very good, regardless of the algae fed. Feed intake of H. spinella was highest, followed by H. musciformis. Growth rates of abalone were within the range obtained under commercial conditions, final shell length and weight being significantly highest in animals fed H. spinella and lowest in those fed G. cornea. Feeding G. cornea lead to the lowest growth performance due to the lowest feed intake, whereas feed conversion ratios were significantly highest for H. musciformis and protein efficiency ratios were higher for both H. spinella and G. cornea. This study suggested the good potential of any of the three red seaweeds tested-successfully produced by the biofilter system, their nutritional composition being similar to other macroalgae used as feed for abalone and matching the abalone protein and lipid requirements-hence promoting growth and survival.

In addition, the abalones response to Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection was assessed. H. discus hannai (shell length: 29.35 +/- 1.81 mm, body weight: 4.28 +/- 0.23 g) were exposed to an 8-week culture experiment in indoor aquariums and a 2-week V. parahaemolyticus artificial infection experiment. In each experiment, the control group (C) was fed daily with the basal feed; the experimental groups were fed daily with the experimental feed, prepared by spraying B. amyloliquefaciens onto the basal feed at final concentrations of 10(3) (group A1), 10(5) (A2), and 10(7) (A3) cfu/g. The survival rate, body weight specific growth rate, and food conversion efficiency in A2 and A3 were significantly higher than those in A1 and C (P < 0.05). The total number of blood lymphocytes, the O2- and NO levels produced from respiratory burst, the activities of acid phosphatase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, and the expression levels of catalase and thiol peroxidase in A2 were not significantly different from those in A3, but these factors were significantly higher in A2 compared to Al and C (P < 0.05). The total antioxidant capacity and expression levels of glutathione S-transferase in Al, A2 and A3 were significantly higher than those in C (P < 0.05). At day 9 after infection with V. parahaemolyticus, all abalone in C were dead; at the end of the experiment, the cumulative mortality of abalone in A2 was significantly lower than that in any other group (P < 0.05). Thus, the experimental feed containing 10(3) cfu/g B. amyloliquefaciens not only facilitated the food intake and growth of abalone, but also effectively enhanced their non-specific immunity and resistance to V. parahaemolyticus infection.

Accordingly, the experimental diets were named as A0, A4, A8 and A16. After 120-days feeding trial, the best growth performance was observed in A8 group (P < 0.05) and there was no significant difference in A0, A4 and A16 groups. With the increase of dietary MOS, the activity of the total antioxidant capacity in hepatopancreas is increasingly elevated (P < 0.05) while no significant difference was observed on activity of glutathione S-transferase (P > 0.05). The activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were firstly increased and then decreased, with the highest values in A8 group (P < 0.05). Immune-related parameters were significantly affected by dietary MOS inclusion. Specifically, the activities of alkaline phosphatase and acid phosphatase in hepatopancreas and serum of abalone fed diets containing MOS were significantly higher than those of control AO group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the highest values of both enzymes were observed in hepatopancreas of A8 group but in serum of A16 group, respectively.

Feeding behavior was scored in terms of the following activities: quiescence, alertness, moving, feeding, distance traveled, velocity, and homing. There was a significant effect of diet type and temperature on feeding behavior of abalone. Both types of abalone were more active and exhibited the highest velocity when fed the formulated diet at 22 degrees C. Greenlip abalone spent a larger proportion of time feeding on Ulva sp. than on the formulated diet, regardless of the water temperature. In contrast, no significant difference was observed in the proportion of time feeding between diet types for hybrid abalone. Both types of abalone rapidly located and consumed Ulva sp. when feed was introduced into the aquaria at 1600 h (light phase). In contrast, abalone predominantly commenced feeding on the formulated diet in the dark phase, indicating the potential of Ulva sp. as feed attractant in abalone diet, to promote feeding. The mode in which abalone consumed feed also differed between diets. Abalone fed the formulated diet nibbled intermittently on random chips, whereas when fed Ulva sp., abalone engulfed entire individual fronds before moving on to the next available frond. Greenlip and hybrid abalone exhibited homing behavior at the completion of the dark phase, which was more pronounced in abalone fed Ulva sp.

The residual feed intake (RFI) was first evaluated in abalone; this was significantly correlated between the two periods, while the feed efficiency ratio (FER) was not significantly correlated between the two periods. Genetic analysis showed that RFI exhibited moderate or high heritability, with respective scores of 0.32 and 0.40 in the two periods, and there was a strong positive genetic correlation between the two periods (0.892 +/- 0.042). RFI showed weak negative genetic correlations with average daily gain (ADG) during the two growth periods (0.144 and 0.008), and a positive genetic correlation with daily feed intake (DFI) (0.901 and 0.794).

Seven isonitrogenous and isolipidic experimental diets were formulated with graded levels of Cr (0.04, 0.67, 1.21, 1.58, 2.21, 2.72 and 3.33 mg/kg) from Cr yeast. The results showed that weight gain rate (WGR) was highest in the group with 1.21 mg/kg of dietary Cr. Based on the broken-line regression analysis for WGR, the dietary Cr requirement of abalone was estimated to be 1.32 mg/kg. With the increase of dietary Cr level from 0.04 to 1.21 mg/kg, the total anti-oxidative capacity and lysozyme activity in the cell-free hemolymph were increased and then decreased when the dietary Cr level exceeded 1.21 mg/kg. After the challenge of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, the cumulative mortality of abalone was significantly decreased in the group with 1.21 mg/kg of dietary Cr compared with that in the control group. Meanwhile, after the heat stress test, the cumulative mortality of abalone was significantly reduced in the groups with 1.58, 2.21 and 2.72 mg/kg of dietary Cr compared with that in the control group. The liquid and water loss of foot muscle were significantly increased in the groups with 2.72 and 3.33 mg/kg of dietary Cr. With the increase of dietary Cr levels, the hardness of foot muscle was significantly elevated. The chewiness of foot muscle was significantly increased with the increase of dietary Cr level from 0.04 to 1.21 mg/kg, and thereafter showed no significant difference when dietary Cr exceeded 1.21 mg/kg. In conclusion, based on the WGR, dietary Cr requirement of abalone (initial weight: 22.31 & PLUSMN; 0.31 g) was estimated to be 1.32 mg/kg.

Trials were done over 150-350 days and change in weight was measured at regular intervals. The 6 diets of single species tested were the red algae Jeannerettia lobata and Laurencia botryoides, the green alga Ulva australis, and the brown algae Macrocystis angustifolia, Phyllospora comosa and Ecklonia radiata. The greatest growth rate and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) for a single algal diet was with J. lobata (51.0 mg . day(-1), 4.0% wet weight). The highest intake was of P. comosa (4.1% body weight), but this did not result in a high growth rate (0.8 mg . day(-1)). Neither intake nor FCE were correlated with growth rate, suggesting that these measures are not good indicators of the nutritional value of a food item. The hierarchy of food preference of H. rubra was determined for the 6 test diets of single species based on chemosensory attractiveness, involving direct tactile and gustatory sampling. Abalone exhibited distinct preferences, the most preferred being J. lobata and the least preferred the phenolic-rich E. radiata. The hierarchy of chemosensory preference for the algae tested was related to the growth rate of abalone when feeding on these algae. Thus, preference appears to be under selective pressure to ensure that abalone select foods that are nutritionally valuable, resulting in optimum growth rates.

Agglutination titre and respiratory burst activity were significantly higher in abalone fed diets supplemented with 40 mg PN kg(-1) than those fed the PN-free diet or the one with 4-deoxypyridoxine (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in immunological characteristics between the abalone fed the diet containing 40 mg PN kg(-1) and those fed the diet containing 800 mg PN kg(-1) (P > 0.05). L. japonica resulted in significantly lower agglutination titre, respiratory burst and phagocytic activities than the artificial diets supplemented with 40 or 800 mg PN kg(-1) (P < 0.05). Total haemocyte count (THC), serum protein concentration, and the activities of lysozyme and acid phosphatase were not significantly affected by the dietary treatments (P > 0.05). These results demonstrate that dietary deficiency of pyridoxine suppresses the immune functions in H. discus hannai, and further investigations are needed to optimise the dietary level of this vitamin for maintaining the best immune responses in abalone.

Two feeds were formulated: one without polyphenol reduction (EA01) and one with polyphenol reduction (EA02). Rehydrated E. arborea (ER03) was used as the control feed. The polyphenol content was quantified in EA01 and EA02, and the stability and hardness of all three feeds were measured at 24 h after immersion. Feed preference was evaluated through attraction and consumption tests on day 1, 6, and 12. The polyphenol concentration was reduced by 41% in EA02 (13.9 mg GAE g(-1)) compared to that of EA01 (33.3 mg GAE g(-1)). Both formulated feeds showed 88% stability and hardness values > 680 g cm(-2), which were greater than those of the control (ER03, 66% and 285 g cm(-2), respectively). Abalone were more attracted to EA02 and ER03 on day 1, 6, and 12 than to EA01 on the same days. A similar trend was observed with consumption. EA02 and ER03 were the most consumed feeds (> 6 g day(-1)) throughout the experiment, and no significant differences in consumption were observed between these feeds. On the other hand, juvenile H. fulgens showed a greater attraction to and consumption of EA02 (reduced polyphenol content) than EA01 (no reduction in polyphenol content).

Sea cucumbers with an average initial weight of 49.3 +/- 5.65 g were fed with a diet containing 3% CP or SP or 0.3% APS over a period of 60 days. The non-specific humoral (phenoloxidase, lysozyme and agglutination titer) and cellular (phagocytic capacity and reactive oxygen species) responses were determined and compared with controls (no supplement) after 20, 40 and 60 days of feeding. Variation in the levels of responses was evident among different supplements. SP and APS significantly enhanced most of the immune parameters tested. Among the humoral responses, lysozyme activity significantly increased after feeding with SP-supplemented diet for 20, 40 or 60 days. Furthermore, lectin titer showed significant enhancement after 20 and 60 days of feeding with APS-supplemented diet. Significant increase in the production of reactive oxygen species was evident for all three supplements after 20 days of feeding, but no significant change in serum phenoloxidase activity was observed for any of the three supplements over the three different periods. Overall, significant modulation of the cellular responses was only noticed after 20 days of feeding with SP- or APS-supplemented diet. After 60 days, these two groups also exhibited a decrease in the cumulative symptom rates compared to the controls when challenged with Vibrio splendidus. These results indicated that dietary intake containing A. membranaceus root or its polysaccharides could enhance the immune responses of A. japonicus and improve its resistance to infection by V. splendidus.

Haliotis kamtschatkana populations are in decline, and current restoration efforts in Washington State rely on out-planting hatchery-produced juveniles. Hatchery personnel report highest mortalities in the postlarval stage of H. kamtschatkana, mainly during the first 3 to 6 months. Postlarvae feed on films of benthic diatoms, and the purpose of this study was to test six diatom species (Achnanthes brevipes, Amphora sauna, Amphiprora paludosa, Cylindrotheca closterium, Navicula incerta, and Nitzschia laevis) as suitable diets for H. kamtschatkana. Diatom diet suitability might rely on several factors, including diatom characteristics as well as the postlarva's ability to ingest the diatoms. The radula is a crucial feeding structure for gastropods and may display morphological plasticity, but this has never been characterized in H. kamtschatkana. We investigated survival, growth, and radula morphology of H. kamtschatkana postlarvae when fed one of six benthic diatom species for 61 days post-settlement. Amphora sauna yielded the highest survival, in a statistically homogenous subgroup with N. incerta, A. paludosa, and C. closterium. Achnanthes brevipes yielded exceptionally low survival, on par with a starvation control. Cylindrotheca closterium yielded significantly better growth than all other diets except A. sauna. Radula development was similar to that of other abalone species. The shape and size of the radula did not explain success or failure of any of the diatom diets since the radula morphology of H. kamtschatkana was comparable to other abalone that have succeeded when fed these same diets. We found no relationship between diatom diet and radula morphology. We recommend A. sauna as a suitable diet for newly settled H. kamtschatkana postlarvae, and that a combination of A. sauna and C. closterium be used to supplement feeding on naturally occurring biofilms.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.736136,,0044-8486,1873-5622,,Feb-25,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.736136,

Larval abalone, obtained from the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center, Aquaculture Department hatchery, were reared in 60-L flow-through tanks with UV-filtered seawater. They were fed 1,200 mg A-MPD bound with either 5.0 mg/mL agar solution, 7.5 mg/mL agar solution, 10.0 mg/mL agar solution, and 12.5 mg/mL agar solution, or a natural diet consisting of diatoms at different feeding frequencies (daily, every other day, or every 2 d) starting at day 5.

Postlarval settlement and survival were not significantly different in diets bound with higher agar concentrations and tested in 3 feeding frequencies. At lower levels of agar incorporation in diets, however, settlement and survival counts became significantly higher on daily feeding. Postlarval settlement and survival were significantly highest with abalone fed a diet bound with 7.5 mg/mL agar solution on a daily feeding frequency. Average percent weight loss in the feed was higher with lower levels of agar incorporation. Average particle size of both A-MPD and diatoms was 4-5 mu m.

This two-part experiment aimed to investigate first (i) the dose effect of replacing soy protein concentrate with SCP in Australian hybrid abalone diets (Haliotis laevigata Haliotis rubra) and second, (ii) the potential for improved palatability of the SCP by using commercially produced liquid protein hydrolysate (PH). This was assessed in a 2 x 2 factorial experimental design. The diets were formulated to be iso-proteic (similar to 40% crude protein as fed) and iso-energetic (similar to 18 MJ kg(-1) as fed). The diets (SCP 0%, SCP 5%, SCP 10%, SCP 20%, SCP 0% + PH, and SCP 20% + PH) were fed to the abalone (similar to 9.25 g initial weight) once daily in the evening for 94 days to apparent satiation. The growth performance and feed utilization of abalone fed with up to 10% SCP was comparable to the control; however, there was a significant reduction in most parameters at the highest inclusion of 20%. In the second experiment, there was a decline in measured protein and energy retention in the abalone fed 20% SCP, with a concomitantly lower apparent biological value. Positively, there were significant improvements in the apparent digestibility of the diet at the 20% SCP inclusion. There was no significant impact of using the PH on growth performance or feed intake. No effects were observed on the digestive enzyme activity (alpha-amylase, lipase, and trypsin) examined among the treatments. Considering these results collectively, the maximum recommended inclusion of methanotrophic SCP meal should be 10% for hybrid abalone.

Dietary CHM significantly elevated the activities of lipase, trypsin, cellulase, Na+/K+-ATPase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and lysozyme and total antioxidative capacity. Besides, dietary CHM significantly reduced the malondialdehyde content and alanine amino transferase activity.

Subsequent investigations showed the higher energy density of the diets was achieved through the addition of fish oil. Given abalone's low requirement for lipids and the small amount of lipase in their gut, it was hypothesized that high levels of dietary lipid depresses the digestibility of other nutrients, such as amino acids, by restricting the action of digestive enzymes. A series of isonitrogenous diets containing 30, 60, or 90 g/kg of either jack mackerel oil or olive oil were formulated and fed to juvenile Haliotis laevigata to determine the apparent fecal digestibilities of dry matter, gross energy, nitrogen (N), and amino acids. inclusion of jack mackerel oil in manufactured abalone feeds at levels above 60 g/kg decreased the digestion of dietary N and amino acids, and inclusion at levels above 30 g/kg decreased gross energy digestion. Oil type also influenced the apparent fecal digestibility of N, amino acids, and gross energy. Olive oil inclusion had significantly different effects on the digestion of these parameters when compared with jack mackerel oil; however, these differences were minimal up to inclusion levels of 30 g/kg. It was concluded that the addition of marine or Vegetable oils to manufactured abalone diets should be limited to 30 g/kg if the digestibility of N, amino acids, and gross energy is not to be affected and that the addition of oils to increase dietary energy levels in abalone diets may not be a cost-effective strategy and may be detrimental to both energy and protein supply.",,"Fleming, Ann/0000-0001-8310-8030",0730-8000,,,DEC,,

We have shown that Haliotis midae fed a probiotic-supplemented diet have an improved survival and growth rate compared to animals not fed probiotics. The growth rate of small (20 mm) and large (67mm) abalone was improved by 8% and 34%, respectively, in two separate eight-month farm growth trials. Furthermore, the number, and pbagocytic activity, of circulating haemocytes was significantly higher (P<0.05) in probiotic treated animals compared to non-treated animals following challenge with the pathogenic bacterium Nbrio anguillarum. Seven days after challenging with V anguillarum, the probiotic-fed animals had 62% survival compared to 25% survival for non-treated animals. In situ protease assays showed that probiotic treatment significantly increased (P<0.05) protease activity in the intestinal region of the digestive tract of animals fed the probiotic-supplemented feed. This correlated with a significant increase (P<0.05) in the amount of protein digestion and absorption measured in this region of the abalone gut. Histological analysis showed that the digestive glands of animals receiving probiotics were bacteria-free, whereas the digestive glands of 70% of the animals receiving the non-supplemented feed had a high bacterial load.

"Ward, PN; Leigh, JA",Genetic analysis of Streptococcus uberis plasminogen activators,2004,INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH,119,,136,140,,"Background & objectives: Streptococci produce a diverse range of secreted plasminogen activators capable of converting mammalian plasminogen to plasmin in a species-specific manner. In all examples to date, the host animal's plasminogen and that of a number of additional species have been shown to interact with these molecules leading to the conclusion that the pathogenesis. of streptococci is in some way dependent upon activation of host plasminogen. PauA was the first plasminogen activator described from Streptococcus uberis, a pathogen frequently isolated from cases of bovine mastitis. Recently, a second S. uberis plasminogen activator (PauB) was identified from a Danish mastitis isolate. Interestingly, the pauB open reading frame occupied the locus normally filled by pauA. In the present study a genetic screen of streptococcal and field isolates frequently associated with mastitis was undertaken to assess the distribution, chromosomal location and sequence variation of these putative virulence factors. Methods: Southern analysis of a diverse panel of streptococci and additional bacterial isolates frequently associated with bovine mastitis was performed using pauA and pauB probes. Sequence variation of PauA was assessed at the protein level following nucleotide sequence analysis of pauA alleles amplified from isolates picked from different geographical locations. Results: We observed plasminogen activators to be universally distributed amongst S. uberis. A pauA allele was identified in all but one strain of S. uberis. This strain had a pauB allele substituted for pauA at the same locus. The remarkably low level of sequence variation demonstrated by PauA was further restricted to a limited number of residues within the molecule. Interpretation & conclusion: The high prevalence of PauA alleles in, field isolates of S. uberis supported the observation that plasminogen activators are likely to confer an advantage with respect to colonization and growth. The findings of the present study support the theory that PauA plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of S. uberis.",,"Leigh, James/0000-0002-0307-2814; Ward, Philip/0000-0003-2546-3426",0971-5916,,,MAY,,15232179

This study explores the effects of dietary grape extract (GE) from Vitis vinifera on the growth performance, oxidative stress regulation, and thermal tolerance of this commercially valuable fish. Over a 60-day feeding trial, four dietary groups were tested: a control diet without GE and three diets supplemented with GE at 2% (GE20), 3% (GE30), and 4% (GE40) with commercial feed. The results demonstrated that GE supplementation positively influenced growth, with the GE20 group achieving the best weight gain and feed conversion ratio among all groups. The upregulation of the growth-related gene igf-1 in the liver of the GE20 group further supported its superior growth performance. Additionally, GE-fed groups showed increased expression of antioxidant-related genes sod1 and sod2 in the liver, while gpx1 exhibited a significant increase only in the GE20 group, indicating enhanced antioxidant defenses. Cat gene expression remained unchanged, and higher GE doses reduced the expression of gpx1, cat, and igf-1. Furthermore, GE supplementation improved cold tolerance in all treated groups compared to the control. These findings suggest that dietary GE at 20 g/kg is particularly effective in enhancing growth performance and cold tolerance in Asian seabass, offering a promising strategy for boosting fish health and adaptability in aquaculture.",10.3390/ani14182731,"Chou, Chi-Chung/0000-0002-4622-2552; Akram, Salman/0009-0009-3224-6068; Ranasinghe, Naveen/0000-0001-5412-6483",2076-2615,,,SEP,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani14182731,39335319

Taking into account that sustainable, eco-friendly production methods are to be a part of future expansion of the abalone industry, growth performance of juvenile abalone reared in an integrated culture system was evaluated and compared with that of abalone fed non-enriched macroalgae. Four macroalgae treatments, three monospecific: Ulva rigida (UN), Hypnea spinella (HN) and Gracilaria cornea (GN) and a composite one ( MN), were produced out of fishpond wastewater effluents, while other four control treatments consisted of the same species reared in fresh seawater (U; H; G; M). Seaweeds reared in fishpond wastewater effluents increased their protein content from 11-.17% to 29-34%. Lipids consisted mainly of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (43-60%), palmitic acid being the most abundant fatty acid (40-47%). Highest EPA percentage was found in red algae H. spinella (6.9%), being ten times higher than that of U. rigida (0.7%). All the algae tested contained very low levels of arachinodic acid (0.1-1.6%) and docosahexaenoic acid (0.5-3%). Protein levels in foot muscle (74-76%) did not differ significantly (P < 0.05) among treatments. Survival was generally high, ranging from 85 to 100%. Weight gain (17-561%) and SGR (0.2-2.3%) were positively related to protein content; whereas, protein efficiency ratio (PER) (0.5-3.7) was negative correlated. PE ratios increased by 82-159% (DW) as a function of the enrichment among the different diets. Food conversion ratio (FCR) (7-188) improved according to the increase in PER. Overall, biofilter-produced macroalgae showed a significantly higher dietary value compared to the control treatments. Similarly, animals fed the mixed diets performed significantly better than those fed a single algal diet. Feeding G. cornea led to the lowest growth performance probably due to the lowest feed intake. The results clearly indicate that H. tuberculata coccinea growout can efficiently take place in an integrated-culture system suggesting that on-farm seaweed-abalone production could be part of future development of the abalone industry in the Canary Islands.

Seven isonitrogenous (about 32% of crude protein) and isolipidic (about 3% of crude lipid) diets were designed with graded levels of methionine (0.46%, 0.77%, 0.97%, 1.19%, 1.41%, 1.71% and 2.07%, respectively). The experimental diets were named as M1 (control), M2, M3, M4, M5, M6 and M7, respectively. An 84-day feeding trial was conducted in sea cages (40 cm x 35 cm x 70 cm) for abalones (initial body weight: 4.10 +/- 0.01 g), which were fed once every two days. The results showed that the biomass gain (BG) of abalone significantly increased (from 560.20 g to 643.83 g) with the increasing dietary methionine levels from 0.46% to 1.19%, and then decreased (from 643.83 g to 484.29 g) (P < 0.05). Based on the broken-line regression analysis of BG, the requirement of dietary methionine for abalone was determined to be 0.99% (dry matter of diet). The highest trypsin activity (862.10 U/mg prot.) and alpha-Amylase activity (0.28 U/mg prot.) in the intestine of abalone were observed in the M4 and M5 group, respectively. In the digestive gland, the gene expression of mtor, s6k and eif4e showed a significant quadratic trend with the increasing dietary methionine levels, and all of them reached their highest values in the M4 group. The highest mRNA level of gcn2 was observed in the M1 group. The glutathione content and total anti-oxidative capacity in cell-free hemolymph (CFH) were significantly increased as dietary methionine levels increasing from 0.46% to 1.19%, and then decreased (P < 0.05).

These digestibilities, in conjunction with total intakes, were used to estimate the daily intakes of nitrogen and energy of abalone feeding on those algal species used by Fleming (1995). These were then used to explain the growth rates, intakes and chemosensory preferences of abalone in that study. The chemosensory preferences of abalone were strongly related to the digestible nitrogen content of the algae and to a slightly lesser extent the nitrogen content of the algae, indicating the important role nitrogen plays in setting preferences in this abalone. The intakes of digestible nitrogen were significantly related to the growth rates of abalone, suggesting that nitrogen is a limiting nutrient to abalone growth, Thus, N. rubra selects those foods which maximise the intake of nitrogen and result in maximum growth rates. Energy does not appear to play a major role in setting abalone preference as the digestible energy contents of algae in this study (and in general) are similar and did not correlate with preference. The digestible nitrogen content was lowest in the 3 brown algae tested and digestibility was related to the polyphenolic content of the brown algae. This suggests that the low growth of H. rubra on these species results from the action of polyphenolic compounds, reducing nitrogen digestibility.",10.1016/0044-8486(95)00055-7,"Fleming, Ann/0000-0001-8310-8030",0044-8486,1873-5622,,Jul-15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0044-8486(95)00055-7,

The aim of this research was to assess how periodic kelp starvation influences growth of the commercially grown abalone, Haliotis midae Linnaeus. Growth of grow-out abalone was monitored on a commercial abalone farm over a period of six months and consisted of 3 treatments with 2 replicates (n = +/- 250 abalone per replicate). The treatments were: Control (abalone always given more kelp than what they typically needed); Treatment 1 (abalone fed their weekly ration only once a week); Treatment 2 (abalone fed half their weekly ration every 3 and then 4 days respectively). While the data at first suggest that the control animals outperform the treatment animals, after undergoing an initial adjustment period to the new feeding regime, the treatment animals perform better. Weight gain and feed conversion efficiencies show that the treatment animals perform better overall. The control animals generally required much more feed to produce comparable increases in both length and weight compared to the treatment animals.

Abalone fed a commercial diet showed a better feed conversion efficiency (FCE). However, the experimental diet with abalone viscera silage gave higher feed consumption resulting in better growth. The dry matter loss from the pellets was highest in pellets containing abalone viscera silage (24.0%), whereas the commercial diet showed the best water stability (10.3%) followed by the fish meal diet (13.5%), Therefore, it will be necessary to achieve better water stability for the abalone viscera silage diet in order to avoid water quality problems at commercial scale.

Fifteen isonitrogenous (approximately 30% CP) casein-gelatin-based diets containing five graded levels of phosphorus (0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0%) for each of three levels of calcium (0%, 1.0% and 2.0%) were fed to the animals previously fed a basal diet (0.23% total P and 0.17% total Ca) for 14 days. After 16 weeks of feeding, survival ranged from 94.7% to 100.0% with no significant difference among dietary treatments. The weight gain rate (WGR), daily increment in shell length (DISL), carcass concentrations of lipid and protein. soft-body alkaline phosphatase activity and phosphorus, zinc, manganese contents were significantly affected by dietary phosphorus levels. Supplementation of 1.0% and 2.0% calcium to the basal diet reduced soft-body phosphorus deposition and did not appear to increase the nutritive value of the diet, indicating that a dietary calcium supplement is not required under the present experimental conditions. The dietary phosphorus requirements were evaluated from the pooled WGR and DISL, respectively, by using the second-order polynomial regression analysis. On the basis of the pooled WGR and DISL, the optimum ranges of dietary available phosphorus were 0.65-1.17% (approximately 0.7-1.2% total P), and 0.64-1.14% (approximately 0.7-1.2% total P), respectively. Based on these results, about 1.15% available phosphorus (1.25% of total P) is recommended for the maximum growth of H. discus hannai, and if dietary available phosphorus is reduced from 1.15% to 0.65%, the growth of the abalone may be depressed with 5% likelihood.

AIA was the only marker that yielded consistent realistic apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs), which were comparable (P > 0.05) to values derived through total collection. Both Cr2O3 and crude fibre in faeces were either lower or similar to their respective levels in feed, resulting in negative ADCs. Leaching of markers from the diets did not have an effect (P > 0.05) on digestibility coefficients.

Washing of faeces with distilled water after collection had no influence (P > 0.05) on AIA content. In all test ingredients, mean apparent amino acid availability reflected apparent protein digestibility. Apparent digestibility of protein in fish meal (76%) by H. midae was within the range of values reported for fish species (62-91%).

Cocconeis sp. was efficiently digested by post-larval abalone, with most of the cells being ruptured during ingestion and/ or passage through the gut. One diatom strain, Pleurosigma sp., resulted to a high survival but produced the slowest growth rate (<10 im.d(-1) SL).

The survival rate, total number of blood lymphocytes, activity of acid phosphatase, and expression level of heat shock protein 70 were significantly higher in B1, B2, and B3 than in C (P < 0.05). The specific growth rate of shell length, food intake, food conversion rate, phagocytic activity of blood lymphocytes, activities of myeloperoxidase and catalase (CAT), and expression levels of CAT and thioredoxin peroxidase of abalones in B2 were significantly higher than those in B1 and C (P < 0.05). Although the level of O-2(-) produced by the respiratory burst of blood lymphocytes in B2 was not significantly different from those in B1 and B3, they were significantly higher than that in C (P < 0.05). The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), the nitric oxide levels produced by the respiratory burst of blood lymphocytes, and the expression levels of Mn-SOD in B1 and B3 were significantly higher than those in C but significantly lower than those in B2 (P < 0.05). Fourteen days after infection with V. parahaemolyticus, the cumulative mortality of abalones in B2 was significantly lower than those in B1 and C (P < 0.05). These results indicate that the food containing 10(5) cfu/mL Bacillus licheniformis promoted food intake and growth of abalones and also improved their resistance to V. parahaemolyticus infection. Thus, B. licheniformis is a good potential probiotic.",10.1016/j.fsi.2018.02.028,"Li, xian/0000-0002-1721-3905",1050-4648,1095-9947,,MAY,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.02.028,29462749

Tunic meal of sea squirt (TSS) is one of the marine fishery by-products that contains a variety of nutrients. In this study, we evaluated TSS as a substitute for FM and MA in abalone (Haliotis discus) diet. A total of 27,600 abalones was distributed into 36 net cages (2300 abalones in 3 cages/diet). Two-way [substitution source (FM and MA), and substitution ratio (50% and 100%)] ANOVA with the repeated design was used.

The prophylactic use of probiotic microorganisms has been shown to enhance the health, growth and nutritional status of a variety of cultured aquaculture species. Furthermore, research has shown that H. midae fed a high protein artificial diet supplemented with the proteolytic marine bacterium Vibrio midae SY9 have enhanced digestive protease activity levels, protein digestion and absorption, and growth. The predominant V. midae SY9 extracellular alkaline protease, VmproA, has been previously shown to be present in the crop/stomach and intestinal regions of H. midae fed a diet supplemented with V. midae SY9. Therefore, VmproA may be responsible for the probiotic properties of the bacterium in farmed abalone. In this study, the role of VmproA on abalone growth was investigated using the mutant strain V. midae SY9Mut2, which is unable to produce VmproA. Over the course of a 180 day laboratory-based growth trial the growth rate of small ( 28 mm) abalone improved by 6.5 and 14.5% following dietary supplementation with V. midae SY9 and V. midae SY9Mut2, respectively, in comparison to abalone fed a basal diet. In situ protease activity within the H. midae digestive tract was significantly increased in animals fed the V. midae SY9 supplemented diet compared to abalone fed either the basal feed or the V. midae SY9Mut2 supplemented diet. Thus, VmproA does not appear to be the factor responsible for increased growth of probiotic-supplemented abalone. Statement of relevance: The manuscript addresses the mechanism of how probiotics function in a farmed abalone species. This is important since probiotic supplementation of feed is proving successful in increasing the growth of these molluscs, and yet very little is known regarding the underlying relationship between the host animal and the probiont.

Measurements were made on 11 length groups of paua, 16-120 mm. Feeding rates depended on body size, with a decrease in the weight-specific grazing rate with increasing shell length up to 66 mm. Grazing rates for rhodophytes, Gracilaria sp. and Hymenocladia sanguinea exceeded those on phaeophytes, Macrocystis pyrifera and Lessonia variegata. The assimilation efficiency of paua feeding on Gracilaria sp. was the highest of the four species tested (85%). During winter, abalone grazing rates at a temperature of 10 degrees C were significantly reduced compared with summer values at 17.5 degrees C. Consumption rates on the kelp L. variegata were similar during summer and winter. Laboratory experiments investigated the effects of density on the feeding and growth rate of juvenile paua, initial length 35-45 mm, over a year. Although feeding rates were relatively constant with increasing density, annual length increment decreased At densities greater than 40 individuals per cubicle (400 m(-2)), there was no length increase and individuals lost weight. The highest growth rate was found at the lowest density, where an annual length increment of 9.2 mm was about half that recorded from field populations. The grazing rates of the black foot paua feeding on natural algal food are discussed in relation to their natural diet, and the algae are evaluated for their potential use as a food supply for abalone mariculture.",,,0730-8000,,,JUN,,

Both the intestines and intestinal microbiota play a key role in energy acquisition and influence FE. In the current research, intestinal microbiota, metabolome, and key digestive enzyme activities were compared between abalones with high [Residual feed intake (RFI) = -0.029] and low FE (RFI = 0.022). The FE of group A were significantly higher than these of group B. There were significant differences in intestinal microbiota structures between high- and low-FE groups, while higher microbiota diversity was observed in the high-FE group. Differences in FE were also strongly correlated to variations in intestinal digestive enzyme activity that may be caused by Pseudoalteromonas and Cobetia. In addition, Saprospira, Rhodanobacteraceae, Llumatobacteraceae, and Gaiellales may potentially be utilized as biomarkers to distinguish high- from low-FE abalones. Significantly different microorganisms (uncultured beta proteobacterium, BD1_7_clade, and Lautropia) were found to be highly correlated to significantly different metabolites [DL-methionine sulfoxide Arg-Gln, L-pyroglutamic acid, dopamine, tyramine, phosphatidyl cholines (PC) (16:0/16:0), and indoleacetic acid] in the high- and low-FE groups, and intestinal trypsin activity also significantly differed between the two groups. We propose that interactions occur among intestinal microbiota, intestinal metabolites, and enzyme activity, which improve abalone FE by enhancing amino acid metabolism, immune response, and signal transduction pathways.

Each tissue had a different FA signature. with the foot, testis and ovary characterized by elevated levels of 20:4n-6 (arachidonic acid-ARA). 20:5n-3 (eicosapentaenoic acid-EPA,) and 18:2n-6 (linoleic acid-LA), respectively. The proportions of LA and EPA in the DG were intermediate between those of the testis and ovary. There was no change in the lipid or fatty acid composition of blacklip or greenlip tissues in response to the two culture temperatures. Likewise, these compositions did not appear to differ between tissues from spent and gravid individuals. Tissue FA profiles from abalone fed a formulated feed are compared to those from macroalgal feeding trials to determine if the formulated feed can be further improved. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Regardless of what they are called in any part of the world, a high monetary value is coupled to this animal, because it is largely considered a seafood delicacy. Subsequently, a great deal of research primarily focused on improving the health and growth rates of abalone were carried out to maximise productivity of the commercial farming efforts in various countries. In this review, we comprehensively describe the most recent available scientific literature on abalone biology, and those aspects related to the growth of this organism; more specifically, those factors related to the uptake and breakdown of metabolic products which ensures long-term growth. We subsequently discuss this in terms of basic animal design, farming outcomes, feeding, cellular growth mechanisms and the unique metabolic processes that exist in these species. Using this information and the knowledge of the metabolic processes in other organisms, we additionally make a number of new hypotheses regarding how these metabolic processes may function in terms of abalone growth. Based on the information presented in this review, we also identify major research opportunities and gaps in the existing knowledge of abalone metabolism, which when elucidated may not only serve the purpose of better understanding these organisms growth but also could potentially lead to increased productivity of the abalone commercial farming sector.",10.1111/raq.12181,"Lindeque, Zander/0000-0001-8017-4278; Loots, Du Toit/0000-0002-0339-6237; Venter, Leonie/0000-0003-0019-3722",1753-5123,1753-5131,,JUN,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/raq.12181,

Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the feeding and defecation patterns and functional response of the abalone to varying food density under ambient water conditions. Like other tropical haliotids, H. asinina prefers red algae to brown algal species. Eighteen algal species, 72.2% of which are red algae (Rhodophyta), were observed in the gut contents of all size groups of abalone; Laurencia, Hypnea, Amphiroa and Coelothrix are the most frequent food species. Hypnea and Laurencia are also the most abundant food items of H. asinina. A chi-square test indicated that frequency of occurrence (%) of most algal food species in the gut samples is independent of the size of the animal. About 84% of all algal species were observed in the gut contents of small abalone. Haliotis asinina (mean shell length +/- SD = 3.48 +/- 0.05 cm) showed a distinct nocturnal feeding periodicity and remained cryptic during daylight hours. Feeding activity was intense from 1800 to 0200 h, but it slowed down a few hours before sunrise, resulting in about 11 h of feeding time within a 24-h cycle. Defecation occurred during the feeding period in proportion to the amount of food consumed and faecal production during the night was significantly higher than during the daylight hours. The total daily faecal output was 1.26 mg dry weight abalone-l. The experiments showed that H. asinina (mean shell length +/- SD = 3.55 +/- 0.02 cm) consumed more food when food density increased in linear proportion to food abundance.

Two experiments were conducted over 93 days to test the effect of diet on the colour of the foot and shell of 1-year old greenlip abalone Haliotis laevigata. In Experiment 1, a commercial control diet and two species of fresh macroalgae (Gracilaria cliftonii and Ulva sp.) were used and each macroalgae species was either non-enriched or enriched with nutrients in the culture media. The shell of abalone fed the commercial diet and fresh Ulva sp. was green but abalone fed fresh G. cliftonii developed a brown shell. The fresh G. cliftonii increased shell colour purity while fresh Ulva sp. increased shell brightness. Feeding abalone with either fresh Ulva or fresh G. cliftonii produced yellowish foot. Nutrient enrichment of algae did not significantly affect the pigment contents in both macroalgae and abalone, and had minimal impact on the colour of shell and foot. With the exception of zeaxanthin, the pigment contents were significantly lower in fresh G. cliftonii than in fresh Ulva sp. Moreover, beta-carotene was the main pigment in abalone fed both species of fresh macroalgae. In Experiment 2, the inclusion of dietary dried algae affected abalone colour. Three diets including a commercial control diet, a diet containing 3% dried Spirulina sp. and a diet containing 10% dried Ulva sp. were used. The shell of abalone fed dried Spirulina sp. was yellow-brown with higher colour purity while the shell remained light green in abalone fed dried Ulva sp. or the commercial control diet. The colour of abalone foot became bright yellow when abalone fed dried Ulva sp. Abalone fed dried algae contained beta-carotene as the principal pigment. This study indicates that fresh macroalgae and dried algae supplementation in feed can change the colour of abalone foot and shell. Feed effect on shell colour was far more than on tissue colour.

Results showed that the EA group exhibited significantly higher growth rates in body weight compared to the C group. However, the EA group also had a higher mortality rate, indicating the negative consequences of eyestalk ablation. The feeding rate was significantly higher in the EA group, especially during nocturnal feeding, suggesting that eyestalk ablation may specifically affect nocturnal feeding behavior in abalone. Both EA and C groups displayed rhythmic oscillations in movement activity, with no significant differences in mesor and amplitude. Nevertheless, the peak of populational movement proportion in the EA group occurred approximately 2 h earlier than that in the C group. Transcriptome analysis identified 417 circadian genes, with the most significant enrichment found in the growth-related thyroid hormone signaling pathway. The expression of five core clock genes (clock, cry, rho, tipin, per) exhibited significant circadian rhythms in H. discus hannai, while their rhythmic oscillation significance was weaker in the EA group, except for the tipin transcript. These findings reveal that eyestalk ablation affects growth, feeding and locomotor behavior, and clock gene expression in abalone, providing valuable insights for understanding the circadian regulatory mechanisms and physiological ecological adaptations of abalone.

The abalone fed G. cliftonii meal developed brown-red colour on the shell and the increased inclusion of algal meal resulted in darker brown shells, whereas abalone fed Ulva sp. meal or the basal diet exhibited light green shells. Although foot hue and foot brightness were not influenced by the type and level of inclusion of dried algal meal, the foot colour saturation of abalone fed >= 10% macroalgal meal was significantly higher than those fed the basal diet. Abalone developed a green lip when fed >= 10% of G. cliftonii meal, whereas lip colour did not change when fed Ulva sp. meal inclusion, compared to the basal diet, and exhibited milky lip colour. Although diet pigments varied with the species of macroalgae and inclusion level, beta-carotene was the major pigment in the tissue of abalone fed all test diets and its content increased significantly with the inclusion level of macroalgae in the diet. Abalone fed the basal diet had significantly lower tissue p-carotene than those fed the diets with macroalgal inclusion. This study suggests that the inclusion of >= 5% G. cliftonii can produce a brown-red shell and the inclusion of >= 10% G. cliftonii intensifies the green colour of the lip.

Final normoxic oxygen uptake was similar in starved and fed p & amacr;ua and declined similarly during hypoxia.Conclusions P & amacr;ua may survive extended periods of starvation by metabolising body tissues and haemocyanin, with only minor changes in their mass, condition and aerobic respiration.Implications These primitive gastropods have mechanisms to survive stressors associated with low food availability.

A feeding experiment was conducted to determine the effects of TCM on innate immunity of abalone, Haliotis discus hannai Ino. Artificial diets containing 1%, 3%, 5% TCM preparation, 1% hawthorn or 1% astragalus, respectively, were fed to juvenile abalone (initial weight 10.38 +/- 2.51 g; initial shell. length 44.15 +/- 4.15 mm) for 80 days. A TCM-free diet was used as a control. Each diet was fed to three replicate groups of abalone using a randomized design. The results indicated that phagocytic activity was significantly higher in abalone fed 3%, 5% TCM preparation, 1% astragalus or 1% hawthorn (P < 0.05). Respiratory burst activity was significantly higher in abalone fed 1%, 3%, 5% TCM preparation, 1% astragalus or 1% hawthorn (P < 0.05). Agglutination titre was significantly higher in abalone fed 5% TCM preparation (P < 0.05). Weight gain ratio (WGR), daily increment in shell length (DISL), total haemocyte count (THC), plasma protein concentration, and the activity of acid phosphatase (ACP) were not significantly affected by the TCM preparation (P > 0.05).

In the present study, the effects of dietary Schizochytrium sp. on the metabolic and intestinal microbial responses, and the intestinal histological structure were investigated in zebrafish. Three experimental diets containing different concentrations of Schizochytrium sp. (0, 60, and 120 g/kg, respectively) were formulated to feed zebrafish for 56 days. The challenge trial with the fish pathogen (Edwardsiella piscicida) showed that a diet with 120 g/kg Schizochytrium sp. significantly increased the survival rate of zebrafish. Additionally, the highest goblet cell density in the intestinal wall was observed in zebrafish fed with 120 g/kg Schizochytrium sp. Metabolomic analysis of humoral fluids indicated that the diet supplemented with Schizochytrium sp. boosted the TCA cycle, energy supply, taurine metabolism, and L-serine metabolism, whereas cholesterol metabolism decreased in zebrafish. The microbiome analysis revealed that a 120 g/kg Schizochytrium sp. supplemented diet could remarkably increase the abundance of beneficial bacteria (i.e., Lactobacillus, Dorea, Butyricicoccus, and Pseudoxanthomonas), and reduce several potential pathogens (i.e., Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, Citrobacter, and Mycoplasmas). Combined omics analysis indicated that Dorea and Butyricicoccus species were related to the disease resistance in fish. The results of dual-omics analysis also revealed that Schizochytrium sp. had the potential to improve some metabolism related to immune function and intestinal health, thus enhancing the disease resistance of zebrafish. Our research provides a novel insight into the effect of microalgae on disease resistance in aquatic animals. Moreover, this investigation sheds substantial light on immune system processes in zebrafish and identifies candidate probiotic bacteria with immunomodulatory properties.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.736631,"Hang, Wei/0009-0009-3954-1123",0044-8486,1873-5622,,Jun-30,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.736631,

At that stage animals need to be moved into a different tank system and weaned onto a formulated feed or alternative algal diets consisting of diatoms or macroalgae that can provide more biomass for the growing juveniles. Two trials were conducted to compare the growth and survival of juvenile greenlip abalone (5.9 +/- 0.6 and 7.1 +/- 0.1 mm in initial shell length) in two rearing systems: (1) shallower tanks with or without horizontal shelter, feeding a commercial formulated feed on horizontal surfaces; (2) deeper tanks with plate system feeding algal diets. The second experiment included two algal diets and two abalone stocking densities for one of the algal diets. The first experiment revealed that the algal diet consisting of Ulvella lens produced the best growth rates during the first 4 wk of the experiment, when juveniles reached about 9 mm in shell length and seawater temperatures averaged 20.1 degrees C. Growth rates on the Ulvella diet declined rapidly thereafter, whereas growth rates on formulated feeds increased, coinciding with a decrease in seawater temperature to 15.2 degrees C at the end of the experiment. The formulated feed produced high growth rates (over 75 mu m day(-1)) once juveniles reached 7 mm in shell length. In the second experiment, the algal diet that included germlings of the green alga Ulva sp. produced the highest growth rates (105 pm day(-1)), indicating that Ulva sp. germlings are a suitable additional food source for juvenile greenlip abalone. Growth rates were particularly high towards the end of the experiment when seawater temperatures were above 19 degrees C. Juveniles stocked at higher density (80 juveniles per plate) feeding on one of the algal diets showed reduced growth rates and overall lower average weight gain per individual compared with the juveniles stocked at low density and juveniles in the tank system feeding on formulated diet. In both experiments the survival was higher on the algal diets (77% to 82%) than on the formulated feed (62% to 65%). Culturing and maintaining algae for larger juveniles in the nursery system involved more labor, compared with the tank systems feeding formulated feed, suggesting that in higher labor cost countries, juveniles should be weaned onto a formulated feed as early as possible. We recommend moving animals into a tank system to feed formulated feed once they reach 7 mm in shell length. The weaning process can be delayed (e.g., to 17 mm shell length) by supplementing with macroalgal germlings if the seawater temperature is high and high mortality is expected when weaning onto formulated diets.

Five isonitrogenous and isolipic (about 33% crude protein and 3% crude lipid) practical diets were formulated to fed abalones (initial body weight: 25.82 +/- 0.51 g; initial mean shell length: 59.57 +/- 0.40 mm). Results showed that 0.98-2.19 dietary EPA/DHA ratio significantly increased abalone's weight gain rate (WGR) and daily increment in shell length (DISL). As for the intestine enzyme activity, trypsin activity was significantly higher when 0.55 EPA/DHA ratio was applied to the diet. The lipase activity in the groups with 0.98 and 0.55 dietary EPA/DHA ratio was significantly higher than those in other groups. And 1.59 dietary EPA/DHA ratio significantly increased alpha-amylase activity. In regard to the intestinal microbiota, the 0.98 dietary EPA/DHA ratio significantly increased the diversity indices and number of OTUs in the intestine, followed by the 2.19 dietary EPA/DHA ratio. At the phyla level, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacterioidota and Actinobacteria were dominant in all groups. The Mycoplasma was the most prevalent genus among all the groups. The highest abundance of Clostridium_sensu_stricto_11, Mycobacterium and Bacteroides belonged to the group with the 0.38 dietary EPA/DHA ratio. The abundance of Bacilli, Terasakiellacease and Ahrensia in 0.38 group were higher than that in the group with 0.98 and 2.19 dietary EPA/DHA ratio.

A 110-day feeding trial was conducted to evaluate effects of replacing FM with CGM on abalone Haliotis discus hannai (initial weight: 21.83 +/- 0.25 g). The control diet (CGM0) was designed to contain 20% of FM. The other four isonitrogenous (about 30% of crude protein) and isolipidic (about 4% of crude lipid) experimental diets were formulated with CGM protein replacing 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of dietary FM protein, respectively. The five experimental diets were named as CGM0, CGM25, CGM50, CGM75 and CGM100, respectively. Results showed that no significant differences were found in survival rate among all the groups. Weight gain rate (WGR) of abalone in the CGM100 group was significantly lower than that in the control group. There were no significant differences in WGR among the CGM25, CGM50, CGM75 and the control groups. The increasing dietary CGM inclusion level elevated the operational taxonomic units, ACE estimator and Chao1 estimator, and changed the intestinal microbiota composition in abalone. The activities of trypsin, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and Na+, K+-ATPase in digestive gland were significantly decreased when replacement level over 50%.

After the 110-day feeding trial, it was shown that completely replacing FM with SPC had no adverse effects on growth, feed utilization and body composition of abalone. The highest weight gain rate of abalone was 119.52 %, which was observed in the SPC25 group. The trypsin activity in the digestive gland within the SPC25 and SPC50 groups exhibited a significant increase compared to that in the remaining groups.

In the current study, an in-depth investigation of the food value of Sargassum horneri as a replacement for Undaria pinnatifida on growth, body composition, body histology, gut microbiota, and the taste sensory profile of abalone Haliotis discus hannai was carried out. After a 12-week feeding trial, the results indicated that 25% replacement (SH25) induced the highest shell-growth performance and best feed utilization values, although there was no significant difference in weight-related growth parameters with the basal (no inclusion of S. horneri) and 50% replacement (SH50) diets. Interestingly, the highest protein content was detected in abalone fed the basal diet followed by SH25 and SH50. The high replacement of S. horneri in the diet showed signs of structural integrity loss in the digestive gland. The results from the pyrosequencing of the genomic DNA from the gut of the abalone indicated an insignificant difference in alpha-diversity parameters and only a clear boundary was observed between SH0 and SH100 diets based on principal coordinate analysis. The bacterial genera Psychrilobacter, Vibrio, and Mycoplasma predominantly occupied the gut of the abalone, although there is a difference in their relative abundance. The taste screening experiment through the use of an electronic tongue showed a comparable taste profile of the abalone and is independent of the diets given. The findings of the present study showed that S. horneri, up to 50% replacement of macroalgal ingredients, can be utilized in feed formulation for H. discus hannai.

The mean production of E. stolonifera obtained from the culture ropes was ca. 12 kg wet wt. m(-1) of culture rope while production of E. cava was ca. 3 kg wet wt. m(-1) of culture rope. The difference in production was attributed from the different growth strategies of the two algae, with only E. stolonifera being able to regenerate blades from the holdfast. The ability to regenerate blades from the holdfast therefore makes E. stolonifera the preferred species for biomass production for abalone feeds.

The use of cultivated macroalgae in place of such feeds could provide for better environmental, nutritional and/or economic outcomes for this industry. However, direct comparison trials using macroalgae and formulated crop feeds are rare, and it is therefore difficult to ascertain the benefits and costs of each feed type. This study compares the benefits to growth and performance of the cultivated hybrid abalone cross (Haliotis rubra 1814 Leach and Haliotis laevigata 1808 Donovan) which was fed one of eight dietary treatments, including two commercially formulated pellet feeds and six mixed macroalgae dietary treatments. Macroalgae dietary treatments comprised the three macroalgae species Grateloupia turuturu Yamada, Ulva australis Areschoug and/or Ulva laetevirens Areschoug. Four replicate tubs, each containing 40 juvenile abalone (10-15 mm), were used to test each dietary treatment over a 12-week period. Macroalgae dietary treatments provided for significantly higher specific growth rates of abalone compared to formulated feeds, by orders of magnitude, for both length (> 0.2 % compared to < 0.1 % day(-1), F (7, 31) = 22.3, p < 0.0001) and weight (from < 0.4 to > 0.8 % day(-1), F (7, 31) = 24.4, p < 0.0001). In addition, abalone health and condition increased, and the proximate composition of abalone tissue had a higher carbohydrate/protein ratio, higher ash content and lower lipid content.

This study was performed in a shallow aquaculture system with a horizontal water flow. After 90 days, significant differences were observed between treatments. The highest growth was obtained with Porphyra (3.3 mm month-1), followed by the mixed diet (2.6 mm month-1), then Macrocystis (2.1 mm month-1) and lastly the formulated diet (1.4 mm month-1).

Results In Experiment 1, abalone fed a diet supplemented with 1.5% FO showed a significantly higher (121.2 +/- 1.1 mg day1) daily growth rate of weight (DGRw) compared to control (70.1 +/- 1.71 mg day1). In Experiment 2, abalone fed 1.5% FO diet and diets containing 2575% FlaxO showed no significant differences in DGRw. The diet containing 100% FlaxO showed significantly lower (63.3 +/- 6.7 mg day1) DGRw. In Experiment 3, abalone fed diets containing 25% and 50% CO showed similar DGRw as those fed a 1.5% FO diet. The diet containing 75% and 100% CO showed significantly lower (63.7 +/- 5.0 to 95.4 +/- 5.1 mg day1) DGRw. Conclusion Supplementation with 1.5% of dietary FO can improve growth performance in cultured abalone.

Feed intake, absorption efficiency, respiration and excretion were measured as functions of dry tissue weight (DTW) in juvenile abalone acclimated on a balanced diet. The daily feed intake (1) was related to body mass by the relationship I (mg day(-1)) = 24.25W(0.59). Absorption efficiency averaged 87% and was independent of body size. The equation relating daily respiration rate (R) to body mass was R (ml O-2 day(-1))= 12.013W(0.704), including night correction. The rate of ammonia excretion (0 was related to dry tissue weight by the equation U (mumol N-NH4 day(-1)) = 43.57W(0.85). The energetic value of food was 18.8 J mg(-1). The low feeding activity (< 1% of abalone live weight per day) was compensated for by a relatively high absorption efficiency and a depression of 23% in the metabolic rate during diurnal activity.

Survival was ca. 100% at 20 degrees C, and between 68% and 75% at 25 degrees C. The highest gross growth rate (109 +/- 4.3 mu m d(-1), 69 +/- 3.9 mg d(-1)) was observed in abalone from the combination 20 degrees C-00:24 L:D. Slowest GGR (38 +/- 4.1 mu m d(-1), 26 1.5 mg d(-1)) was observed in the combination 25 degrees C-24:00 LID. Organisms from 25 degrees C exhibited signs of the withering syndrome at the end of the experiment. Gross energy content (4.4 to 4.6 kcal g(-1) tissue dry wt, TDW) and crude protein (60 to 68% TDW) were not significantly affected by either temperature or photoperiod, but organisms from 20 degrees C exhibited lower moisture content (86.8 to 88.6%) and higher tissue:shell ratio (0.34-0.40) than those from 25 degrees C (88.9 to 92.1%; 0.22-0.31 respectively). Feed consumption markedly increased at night, decreased with age, and was higher at 25 degrees C than 20 degrees C, irrespective of photoperiod. Highest C was observed under continuous darkness (0.66 to 0.95% BW d(-1) at 20 degrees C and 0.84 to 1.25% BW d(-1) at 25 degrees C), and was lowest under continuous light (0.50 to 0.82% BW d(-1) at 20 degrees C and 0.71 to 1.02% BW d-1 at 25 degrees C). FCR and PER were both affected by temperature but not by photoperiod. Higher PER (2.2 to 3.4) and lower FCR values (0.69 to 1.05) were observed at 20 degrees C, when compared to 25 degrees C (PER 1.35 to 2.09, FCR 1.10 to 1.86). Sex ratios were ca. 1: 1 in the 00:24 and 12:12 L:D photoperiods, yet ca. 50% of abalone from the 24:00 L:D photoperiod were immature at the end of the experiment. It is concluded that H. fulgens can be best cultured at 20 degrees C and 00:24 or 12:12 L:D regimes, while sustained temperatures at or above 25 degrees C may result in cumulative stress, altered physiological rhythms, and delayed maturation.

Using a video surveillance system, the current study showed that the feeding behaviors of DD and DF exhibited an obvious circadian rhythm, with significantly more feeding at night by DD and DF than during the day. In addition, the amount of time feeding by DF during the day and at night was significantly higher compared with that of DD, especially at ZT8 (20:00), ZT12 (24:00), ZT16 (04:00), and ZT20 (08:00), with the proportion of time feeding by DF increasing 2.22-, 1.60-, 2.71-, and 2.40-fold compared with those of DD, respectively. The maximum values of pepsase activity in DD and DF, of alpha-amylase activity in DD, and of alginate lyase activity in DF coincided with the peak feeding period. Relative to the changes in expression levels of neuropeptide Y receptor (NPYR) in the intestine, diurnal changes in NPYR expression levels in cerebral ganglia were consistent with the changes in feeding behavior, being highest at 24:00 h in both DD and DF and then declining. There was no significant difference in the circadian expression levels of cholecystokinin receptor (CCKR) in the cerebral ganglia, whereas, in the intestinal tract, peak CCKR expression levels coincided with its anorexigenic effect; the expression levels of CCKR in the intestinal tract exhibited a significant circadian rhythm in DD. These results explain the growth advantage of DF over DD in terms of feeding behavior and digestive physiology, and support the hypothesis that diurnal changes in feeding-related genes in the nervous and digestive systems are correlated with the initiation of abalone feeding behavior.

The inclusion of dried macroalgal meals in formulated diets may also provide other benefits such as improvement in growth, health and survival. In this 92 d study, energy allocation in Greenlip Abalone, Haliotis laevigata, fed either a commercial diet, the control diet (0% macroalgae meal inclusion), or diets containing three inclusion levels (5, 10 and 20%) of either of two enriched macroalgae meals, Gracilaria cliftonii and Ulva sp., was investigated. Energy budget models, which also accounted for shell growth energy and mucus production energy, were determined for each diet. Results varied in relation to energy budget components and diets. Overall, abalone fed the enriched G. cliftonii ingested significantly more dietary energy and exhibited higher somatic growth energy compared to those fed the commercial diet, the 0% control diet or the enriched Ulva sp. diets. Additionally, ingested feed energy decreased while somatic growth energy tended to increase with increasing enriched G. cliftonii meal inclusion level. In contrast, inclusion at any level with enriched Ulva sp. meal did not result in an improvement of somatic growth energy compared to the commercial or the 0% control diet. For ingested feed energy, 20% enriched Ulva sp. meal inclusion resulted in significantly higher values compared to either the commercial diet, control diet or the two other enriched Ulva sp. meal diets. However, abalone fed the 20% dried Ulva sp. meal diet lost significantly more energy through faecal egestion than those fed the commercial or the 0% control diets, suggesting reduced diet digestibility with increasing enriched Ulva sp. inclusion. The majority of ingested feed energy was allocated to somatic growth across treatments, while shell growth energy accounted for the smallest proportion of the energy budgets. Results suggest that the inclusion of enriched G. cliftonii meal (10% inclusion optimum) in formulated diets for Greenlip Abalone has energetic benefits for feed utilisation and growth which may lead to improved business productivity.

However, when upright whole plants were given to H. iris, the highly preferred kelp Lessonia variegata was consumed in lower proportions than the less preferred but more accessible red alga Gigartina circumcincta. H. iris were less capable of reaching the blades or consuming the stipe of L. variegata, which has a stipe of similar to 100-350 mm high. H. iris consumed greater amounts of drift over benthic L. vareigata. Water movement appeared to inhibit the active grazing of H. iris, but not the drift-trapping behavior, resulting in lower overall feeding rates for abalone under conditions of higher water movement.

Abalone aquaculture is still a developing industry, and at least two major issues, nutrition and health, impede its development. Abalone are fed macroalgae on-farm in a number of countries, including China, Korea, South Africa and Chile. Formulated diets are crucial to the success of abalone aquaculture in countries where abalone do not grow readily when fed brown macroalgae or when access to macroalgae is insufficient for culture. Typically, the growth rate of abalone fed formulated diets is higher than abalone fed live macroalgae. However, due to a long production period, diets for abalone not only need to sustain high growth rates, but also maintain optimal health. Feeding live macroalgae improves the feeding activity, health and marketability of abalone. In this review, the nutritional requirements of abalone and dietary ingredients used in formulated diets will be discussed, together with the use of dried macroalgal meal as a dietary ingredient in formulated diets to improve the feeding activity, health and marketability of abalone in commercial production.",10.1111/raq.12085,"Qin, Jianguang/0000-0003-2448-8058; Harris, James/0000-0002-0997-3015",1753-5123,1753-5131,,JUN,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/raq.12085,

A major risk factor for this sector is slow growth rates experienced during farming. Abalone feeds are often supplemented with amino acids in an attempt to enhance abalone growth. This is a first investigation of the effect of added proline to standard abalone feed, on the metabolite profile of slow-growing abalone. A targeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics research approach was followed to recognise the metabolic response of abalone showing slower growth performance. The addition of proline to the standard abalone diet was found to serve as a substrate for amino acid catabolism in slower growing abalone, by means of proline breakdown to assist with energy production via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Other amino acids and urea cycle intermediates, that is, arginine, asparagine, ornithine and creatine further support energy production via the action of protein catabolism in slow-growing abalone. Additionally, the importance of understanding how abalone respond metabolically to modified feed highlights the use of metabolomics to answer abalone aquaculture farming questions.",10.1111/are.13978,"Venter, Leonie/0000-0003-0019-3722; Vosloo, Andre/0000-0002-1191-4217; Mienie, Japie/0000-0003-0860-5285; Loots, Du Toit/0000-0002-0339-6237; Lindeque, Zander/0000-0001-8017-4278",1355-557X,1365-2109,,APR,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.13978,

All diets were formulated to contain 27% crude protein, 13% of which was contributed by the various leaf meals. Fresh seaweed Gracilariopsis bailinae served as the control feed. juvenile Haliotis asinina (mean body weight = 13.4 +/- 1.6 g, mean shell length = 38.8 +/- 1.4 mm) were fed the diets at 2-39% of the body weight day(-1). Seaweed was given at 30% of body weight day(-1). After 120 days of feeding, abalone fed M. oliefera, A. pinnata-based diets, and fresh G. bailinae had significantly higher (P < 0.01) specific growth rates (SGR%) than abalone fed the L. leucocephala-based diet. Abalone fed the M. oliefera-based diet had a better growth rate in terms of shell length (P < 0.05) compared with those fed the L. leucocephala-based diet but not with those in other treatments. Furthermore. protein productive value (PPV) of H. asinina was significantly higher when fed the M. oliefera-based diet compared with all other treatments (P < 0.002). Survival was generally high (80-100%) with no significant differences among treatments. Abalone fed the M. oliefera-based diet showed significantly higher carcass protein (70% dry weight) and lipid (5%) than the other treatments.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of four different macroalgae (Gracilaria tenuistipitata, Laminaria japonica, Gelidium japonica, and Sargassum sp.) on the feed intake and feeding rate of juvenile Haliotis asinina Linnaeus (H. asinina), and the effect of these macroalgae on abalone food choice as single or combined diets. juveniles of H. asinina with mean initial weight and shell length of 5.2 +/- 0.9 g and 24.2 +/- 0.7 mm, respectively, were selected, and the experiments lasted for approximately 100 days. In trial 1, there were four treatments, and each supplied with a single macroalgal species with 24 h fasting; in trial 2, all four macroalgal species were supplied together with 24h fasting; in trial 3, the juveniles were fasted for an additional 24 h before supplying a single diet to explore the effect of the fasting; and in trial 4, different combinations of macroalgae were supplied as diet for biological evaluation of factors, including daily rate of shell increase, weight growth rate, specific growth rate, and feed conversion efficiency. Comparison of different feed intakes, feeding rates, and selection rates suggested that H. asinina juveniles showed different feeding preferences for the different macroalgae. The most consumed diet was G. japonica (red algae), followed by G. tenuistipitata (red algae), and L. japonica (brown algae), and finally, Sargassum sp. (brown algae). The results of trial 4 suggested that mixed feeds had better effects than single diets (P<0.05), and the best diet combination was L. japonica and G. tenuistipitata. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this 91-d study we investigated the effects of feeding four diets containing graded levels of crude protein (CP; 27, 30, 33 and 36%) at three seasonal water temperatures (14, 17 and 20 degrees C) on the energy budget components for 6-month-old Greenlip Abalone, Haliotis laevigata, (0.91 g; 19.46 mm shell length). The increase of water temperature significantly increased individual energy budget components, rates for somatic growth energy, respiration energy and shell growth energy of abalone. Ammonia excretion energy rate was positively related to increasing dietary CP levels. In contrast, there were significant interactions between water temperature and dietary CP levels for ingested feed energy rate, absorbed energy rate and egested faecal energy rate. For energy budgets, respiration energy accounted for the largest proportion and ranged between 34.1 and 43.9% of the ingested feed energy. Somatic growth energy (16.80-28.10%) also accounted for a large proportion of the energy budget. Although egested faecal energy was lower, it still accounted for 8.2-17.9% of the ingested feed energy. In contrast, pedal mucus production energy (4.12-6.20%), ammonia excretion energy (0.28-1.40%) and shell growth energy (0.22-0.46%) accounted for relatively smaller proportions of ingested feed energy. Water temperature significantly impacted energy budgets more than dietary CP level. To maximise energy transfer to somatic growth, a water temperature of 20 degrees C is recommended for culturing Greenlip Abalone. Additionally, to minimise energy loss through faecal egestion, a dietary CP level of 36% is recommended for the diet of 6-month-old Greenlip Abalone at optimum water temperatures. However, the increase in ammonia excretion energy at high dietary CP should also be considered when managing water quality and waste production in abalone farms, especially where tank water exchange is limited. These findings provide a better understanding of the energy budgets for Greenlip Abalone, in relation to temperature and dietary protein levels, and will aid in the development of sustainable diets applicable to the three-four years of culture.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.736499,"Qin, Jianguang/0000-0003-2448-8058; Harris, James/0000-0002-0997-3015",0044-8486,1873-5622,,Apr-15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.736499,

First, a pebble coated with crustose coralline algae (CCA) was used to induce competent H. diversicolor larvae to metamorphose at 2, 5,8,12, or 17 days (Group A) or 2,6, 10, or 12 days (Group B) after fertilization. To observe spontaneous attachment and metamorphosis, some larvae from Group B were maintained without the addition of a CCA-coated pebble. Rapid metamorphosis was observed in older larvae of both CCA-induced groups; 2 days after the addition of the CCA-coated pebble, 50-75% of the 2-day-old larvae and more than 85% of the 5-12-day-old larvae had metamorphosed. The percentage of spontaneously metamorphosed individuals increased 14 days after fertilization, reaching 50.6 +/- 16.7% (mean +/- S.E.) at 18 days. Second, metamorphosed post-larvae that had experienced larval periods of 5, 8, 11, or 15 days (Group A) or 4, 7, or 10 days (Group B) were reared at 26 degrees C with or without the benthic diatom Nitzchia ovalis as the sole food source. The survival and growth rates of the fed post-larvae in both groups decreased with the length of the larval swimming period; of the post-larvae from larvae of more than 7-11 days old, fewer than 70% still survived 16 days after metamorphosis. Mean growth rates during the 6 days after metamorphosis were lowest for the post-larvae from the larvae with the longest period of swimming. Third, newly settled post-larvae from 2-day-old larvae were reared at 26 degrees C with delays of 0, 3,6,9, or 12 days before first feeding (N. ovalis). Feeding delays of longer than 6 days dramatically depressed post-larval survival rates: approximately I week after the onset of feeding, more than 65% and fewer than 20% of the larvae subjected to feeding delays of 0-3 days or 6-12 days, respectively, still survived. These results indicate that H. diversicolor is more susceptible to the detrimental effects of delayed metamorphosis and delayed post-settlement feeding than are the larger abalone species Haliotis discus hannai and Haliotis iris.

The redox regime was the principal factor affecting growth, biochemical composition and behaviour, while substrate depth and particle size did not significantly affect growth rate or biomass production. Animals cultured under fully oxic conditions exhibited negative growth and had higher lipid and carbohydrate contents, potentially due to compensatory feeding in response to higher micro phyto benthic production. In contrast, animals in the stratified treatments spent more time feeding, generated faster growth and produced significantly higher biomass yields (626.89 +/- 35.44 g m(-2) versus 449.22 +/- 14.24 g m(-2); mean +/- SE). Further, unlike in oxic treatments, growth in the stratified treatments did not reach maximum biomass carrying capacity, indicating that stratified sediment is more suitable for culturing sea cucumbers.

For example, the loss of the native main food, Macrocystis pyrifera, and the subsequent takeover of non-indigenous algae species represent a major threat to abalone growth and survival. In Baja California, Mexico two introduced macroalgae, Undaria pinnatifida and Sargassum horneri have become common in the past decade with unknown consequences on native herbivores. In this work, we explored the effect of these invasive algae on the growth and survival of juvenile red abalone, Haliotis rufescens. One hundred and ten juvenile red abalone were tagged and fed with invasive algae U. pinnatifida and S. horneri, and a control with M. pyrifera. Then, the shell length, body weight, and survivorship were assessed monthly for 90 days. Results show that abalone fed U. pinnatifida had a total growth in length, weight, and survivorship, similar to those fed native M. pyrifera. In contrast, abalone fed S. horneri had significantly lower overall performance. Marine heatwaves and other climatic impacts are expected to favour the establishment of invasive species.

As a typical nocturnal creature, the Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) exhibits rhythmic behaviors in terms of passively selecting whether to avoid predators or to forage, and active adaptation to light cycle changes is regulated by the biological clock. However, no basic data are available to help us to understand these rhythmic behaviors in the abalone species. In the present study, quantification of behavioral data for the abalone and its predator swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus in short-term (24 h) and long-term (40 days) polyculture scenarios suggests that the distance and duration of movement, percentage of feeding individuals, and cumulative duration of feeding of the abalone individuals were significantly lower under the short-term predation risk than the long-term predation risk. The concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), protein kinase A (PKA), and hexokinase (HK) in hemolymph, and expression levels of 5-HT1A receptor and 5-HT2 receptor in cerebral ganglion were significantly higher under the long-term predation risk than the short-term predation risk. The concentration of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glycogen content in adductor muscle of the abalone was significantly higher under the short-term predation risk than the long-term predation risk, thereby implying their role in anaerobic metabolism and aerobic metabolism as primary energy sources under the short-term and long-term predation risk, respectively. The concentrations of 5-HT and cAMP, and the expression levels of Bmal1 and 5-HT2 receptor exhibited no significant signs of cosine rhythmicity under the short-term predation risk, but changes in the movement and feeding behaviors of the abalone still occurred at the night only. Correlation analysis shows that the expression levels of Bmal1 and Clock had significantly positive correlations with the circadian changes in the movement parameters of the abalone, thereby suggesting a dominant role in the rhythmic expression of endogenous circadian clock genes regulating the rhythmic behavior of the abalone. These findings provide new insights into the origin and evolution of biological rhythms in nocturnal marine animals and a reference for developing rational stock enhancement plans, and would improve protection for marine benthic biodiversity.",10.3389/fmars.2022.1015076,,,2296-7745,,Oct-05,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.1015076,

Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the E-test. Genes encoding antimicrobial resistance and invasiveness factors were examined by PCR. A total of 27 strains were obtained from 326 mastitis milk samples. Streptococcus parauberis isolates (n=11) showed high resistance to erythromycin (90.9%), followed by tetracycline (45.5%), chloramphenicol (36.4%) and clindamycin (27.3%). Streptococcus uberis isolates (n=16) were highly resistant to tetracycline (81.3%) and clindamycin (62.5%). Both species were susceptible to ampicillin. The most prevalent resistance gene in S. uberis was tetM (80.0%), followed by blaZ (62.5%) and ermB (62.5%). However, tetM, blaZ, and ermB genes were only found in 27.3, 45.5, and 27.3%, respectively, of S. parauberis. In addition, all of the isolates carried at least one selected virulence-related gene. The most prevalent virulence-associated gene pattern in the current study was sua+pauA/skc+gapC+hasC detected in 22.2% of the strains. One S. uberis strain carried 7 virulence-associated genes and belonged to the sua+pauA/skc+gapC+cfu+hasA+hasB+hasC pattern. More than 59.3% of analysed strains carried 4 to 7 virulence-related genes. Our findings demonstrated that S. parauberis and S. uberis isolated from clinical bovine mastitis cases in China exhibited diverse molecular ecology, and that the strains were highly resistant to antibiotics commonly used in the dairy cow industry.

In this study, we attempted to treat small abalone with anti-Vibrio IgY to elicit a passive immunity directly against V. alginolyticus infections. Anti-Vibrio IgY was alginate encapsulated in egg powders as feed, which may avoid antibody inactivation in the gastrointestinal tract of small abalone. The feed was tested for the stability of anti-Vibrio IgY in a gastrointestinal mimic environment. The result showed anti-Vibrio IgY retained activity as high as 90% after 4 h exposure to pancreatic enzymes.

At settlement, two plate conditioning times for the green alga Ulvella lens (conditioned for 6 or 8 wk) were evaluated and compared with plates colonized by different diatom species (Navicula cf. jeffreyi and Cocconeis sp.). In a choice experiment an overall settlement rate of 87% was estimated 3 days after larval release. The majority of the larvae chose to settle on U. lens (61% on 8-wk-old and 14% on 6-wk-old U. lens, with average algal cover of 97% and 82% respectively). Larvae showed a clear preference for older than for younger U. lens, with similar percentage cover. indicating that the developmental stage of the alga and not percentage cover per se is important in settlement induction. Only 7% and 5% respectively of the settled larvae were found on the plates colonized by the diatom species N. cf. jeffreyi and Cocconeis sp. Results clearly demonstrate that U. lens provides a suitable substrate to improve the settlement of Haliotis laevigata larvae on commercial scale. Juvenile growth (mu m day(-1)) oil a mixed diet of U. lens and N. c jeffreyi was not constant and increased with size to 70-80 mu m day(-1). Both growth rate and size variability increased over time until juveniles reached approximately 5 mm in shell length. The survival declined to ca. 30% at 44 days after settlement but stabilized thereafter. Distinct increases in size variability were observed between 3 and 16 and between 30 and 44 days after settlement. followed by elevated growth rates and a change from monomodal to multimodal distribution at day 44. The latter coincided with a shift in diet from a diatom-dominated diet to a macroalgal diet of U. lens at day 44. The increase in growth rate between 3 and 16 days is believed to reflect a shift in nutrition with postlarvae switching from absorbing yolk reserves to efficient exogenous feeding. The growth. Survival, and size variability of juveniles was assessed when feeding on algal diets as well as a formulated diet. Juveniles grew faster on U. lens than on a formulated feed or plates colonized with the diatom N. cf. jeffreyi. Results indicate that growth Of juveniles may be more variable when feeding on natural feed (Navicula cf jeffreyi., U. lens) than on a formulated feed. However, until a feed is formulated that can match the mean growth rates achieved on U. lens, we suggest keeping juveniles on plates colonized with U. lens as long as possible.

Field observations showed that all juvenile abalone remained concealed under urchins by day. Even by night, only 10-25% left the protection of urchins to forage. Offered a choice of rocks or urchins in tide pools, the juveniles strongly preferred urchins rather than rocks. In aquaria, both urchins and abalone were active only at night. The frequency with which juvenile abalone left shelter was greatest if rocks constituted the only form of concealment, intermediate when they sheltered under urchins alone and least when the urchins had access to drift kelp. The treatment that provided abalone with both urchins and drift kelp had the lowest rate of urchin movement and the highest microalgal benthic standing stocks, the gut contents of the abalone comprised mainly kelp and their gut fullness indices were higher than in the other treatments. Concealment of juvenile abalone beneath urchins evidently provides them with several benefits. First, when urchins trap drift kelp, the abalone are capable of feeding on it and enhance their uptake of food. Second, this behaviour reduces the frequency with which juvenile abalone leave the shelter of urchins. Third, urchins that trap drift kelp reduce their rates of movement and their consumption of benthic microalgae, and we speculate that this may improve feeding conditions for the early postsettlement recruit stages of H. midae, and reduce the risk of urchins bulldozing them.

In aquatic ecosystems, certain fish and shellfish experience prolonged and short-term starvation stress, particularly during periods of extreme weather in the wild and inadequate feeding practices in aquaculture systems. Nutritional deficiencies caused by either short-term or prolonged starvation can lead to stress-induced health issues in fish and shellfish. Our study aimed to assess the impact of repeated short-term fasting and refeeding on immunological parameters and growth performance in the disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus. Abalones were randomly assigned to three distinct feeding patterns, with three replicates per group: Group I underwent continuous feeding for 35 days (CF), Group II experienced a repetitive cycle of 3-day fasting and 4-day refeeding for 35 days (PF) and Group III underwent no feeding for a 35-day period (NF). We measured survival and growth rate as well as analysed immunological parameters, such as total haemocyte count, phenoloxidase activity, respiratory burst activity, lysozyme activity and protein content across the groups. The results indicated that different feeding treatments impacted these immune responses differently across groups. Specifically, the group exposed to NF experienced a significant reduction in total haemocyte count (THC), respiratory burst activity and protein concentration, whereas phenoloxidase activity and lysozyme activity were highest in this group. The CF group showed no significant changes in respiratory burst activity, protein content, phenoloxidase activity and lysozyme activity. In contrast, the cycling short-term fasting and refeeding (PF) group exhibited higher lysozyme and phenoloxidase activities but had a lower THC. No differences were observed for respiratory burst activity and protein content in this group.

To deal with this issue anti-biotics are a widely-preferred control strategy, but one that poses risks to the environment and humans, if used indiscriminately. In pursuit of an alternative, probiotics have emerged recently among viable alternatives for health management in aquaculture. The prophylactic use of probiotics in farmed shellfish species, i.e., shrimp, prawn, crab, crayfish, oyster and abalone, has been demonstrated to enhance production, promote the host internal microbiota, resulting in reduced incidence of bacterial, parasitic and even viral (e.g., White Spot Syn-drome Virus/WSSV, Yellowhead disease/YHD) diseases. Probiotics can be administered either as feed supple-ments or directly into rearing water, the former being generally more effective. Although precise modes of action are unknown, probiotics can deliver some measure of sustainability to shellfish aquaculture in multiple ways, including contributions to pathogen exclusion, better growth, survival and feed utilization, and immune mod-ulation. Antiviral mechanisms of probiotics are not well documented, but certain protobionts such as Bacillus and Lactobacillus have been effective in developing disease resistance and in reducing the prevalence of WSSV and YHD in a number of studies.

Apparent protein digestibility coefficients exceeding 100% were found for sunflower meal and canola meal included into a reference diet. This also occurred when evaluating different inclusion levels of soybean meal into a fish meal reference diet, eliminating the opportunity to test the influence of inclusion level of soybean meal on apparent nutrient digestibility. Associative effects between different feed ingredients, diet and faecal nutrient leaching and mathematical artifacts in calculations when using substitution vs. single protein diets might have an influence on final apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) of highly digestible feed ingredients.

The crude protein, lipid, and ash composition of edible abalone flesh were similarly unaffected (P > 0.05). The gut microbiota profile of abalone was analyzed through next-generation sequencing. The alpha-diversity indicators (microbial richness and abundance) were statistically similar (P > 0.05), and the beta-diversity of operational taxonomic units revealed short distances within samples and clustering among diet groups. The core phyla (Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Tenericutes) and genera (Psychrilyobacter, Vibrio, Mycoplasma) known to inhabit the gut of abalone predominantly were likewise identified irrespective of diets; however, there is a difference in their relative abundance. Genus Psychrilyobacter was relatively abundant in UN and FE compared with HT, whereas Vibrio and Mycoplasma had higher abundance in FE and HT-fed abalone, respectively. Taste sensory attributes were discriminated in the abalone meat using an electronic tongue. Principal component analysis of sensor scores revealed several overlapping points, resulting in a negative discrimination index (-184), which means no apparent difference in the general taste profile was detected. Furthermore, the taste screening matrix through radar mapping revealed slight intensity differences in the umami, saltiness, and sourness flavor.

Refinement procedures focused on the application of additional binder (sodium alginate), use of different feed forms (molo and noodle forms), and incorporation of Spirulina spp. as alternate protein source in partial replacement of other protein sources. Groups of 22 postlarval abalone with mean initial shell length (SL, 29 +/- 0.01 mm) and weight (5.67 +/- 0.06 g), harvested from the mollusc nursery of Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center, Aquaculture Department in Tigbauan, Iloilo, were stocked each as replicate in five plastic trays measuring 31.7 x 43.5 x 39.0 cm. The trays were suspended in five 1 x 2 x 1-m concrete land-based tanks representing the five dietary treatments. Abalone were fed either the refined formulated diet, molo form(RF-M), refined formulated diet, noodle form(RF-N), unrefined formulated diet, noodle form(UF-N), unrefined formulated diet, molo form (UF-M), and seaweed (NF), as the reference diet. Formulated diets and natural food were given at 2%-3% and 10%-15% (wet weight) of the body weight, respectively, once daily at 1600 h for 180 days. Water quality measurements were maintained at desired levels. A flow-through filtered seawater system with continuous aeration was provided in each tank. A parametric one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey' s post hoc test were used to test the differences in abalone SL, weight gain (WG), and specific growth rate (SGR) while nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used for daily growth increase in SL (DG(SL)) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) among the various dietary treatments. Percent diet water stability and apparent digestibility coefficient for dry matter (ADMD) and apparent digestibility of seaweed as ingredient were, likewise assessed. A Hedonic scale taste test analysis was done to assess differences in abalone meat quality. Highest mean WG (239.17% +/- 26.05%), mean SL increase (91.51% +/- 3.28%), DGSL (2,296.67 mu m/day), SGR (4.04 +/- 0.27) were attained with abalone fed RF-N. Values, however, were not significantly different (P > 0.05) for all growth parameters in RF-M except for percent increase in SL at 74.25 +/- 3.11. Abalone given UF-N and UF-M showed significantly lower mean WG and SL. Survival was high and was significantly different (P < 0.05) between treatments. The highest FCR was obtained with abalone fed seaweeds. Apparent digestibility for dry matter of both the RF and UF were high at 95.67% +/- 1.17% and 95.95% +/- 0.45%, respectively. Apparent digestibility of ingredient seaweed was 99.4% +/- 1.38%. Regression analysis of data showed better percent water stability for RF (57%; R-2 = 0.954) compared with UF (38%; R-2 =0.790)after 24 h. Meat quality of the final product assessed through Hedonic scale taste testing and one-way ANOVA did not show any significant variations in taste, texture, color, odor, and general acceptability.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary CAP inclusion on the anti-oxidation, immunity, inflammation, disease resistance and gut microbiota of abalone Haliotis discus hannai after a 110day feeding trial. Three isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets were formulated by adding 0 % (control), 4.10 % (CAP4.10) and 16.25 % (CAP16.25) of CAP, respectively. A total of 540 abalones with an initial mean body weight of 22.05 +/- 0.19 g were randomly distributed in three groups with three replicates per group and 60 abalones per replicate. Results showed that the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in the cell-free hemolymph (CFH) were significantly decreased and the content of malondialdehyde in CFH was significantly increased in the CAP16.25 group. The diet with 4.1 % of CAP significantly increased the activities of lysozyme and acid phosphatase in CFH. The expressions of pro-inflammatory genes such as tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnf- alpha ), nuclear factor kappa b ( nf- kappa b ) and toll-like receptor 4 ( tlr4 ) in digestive gland were downregulated, and the expressions of anti-inflammatory genes such as beta-defensin and mytimacin 6 in digestive gland were upregulated in the CAP4.10 group. Dietary CAP inclusion significantly decreased the cumulative mortality of abalone after the challenge test with Vibrio parahaemolyticus for 7 days. Dietary CAP inclusion changed the composition of gut microbiota of abalone. Besides, the balance of the ecological interaction network of bacterial genera in the intestine of abalone was enhanced by dietary CAP. The association analysis showed that two bacterial genera Ruegeria and Bacteroides were closely correlated with the inflammatory genes. In conclusion, the 4.10 % of dietary CAP enhanced the immunity and disease resistance as well as inhibited the inflammation of abalone.

The maximum nitrogen content obtained by U. rigida in this study was 6.099%, which resulted from an inorganic nutrient concentration of 7 mg N l(-1). However, no further significant increase in enrichment occurred from nutrient concentrations of 10 and 15 mg N l(-1). Abalone specific growth rate in shell length (SGR(L)) and wet weight (SGR(W)) and foot muscle yield were significantly higher for abalone fed the artificial diet compared to those fed any U. rigida diet. Abalone fed U. rigida enriched in less than 15 mg N l(-1) had similar growth rates compared to abalone fed unenriched U. rigida. Abalone fed the artificial diet contributed a higher percentage of weight gain into the valuable foot muscle. The foot muscle moisture content of abalone fed the artificial diet was significantly lower than that of abalone fed any U. rigida diet.

However, studies on the use of RP on aquatic animal species are limited. This study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with RP formulation on the growth, non-specific immunity, and disease resistance of juvenile ivory shells (Babylonia areolata). The experiment was conducted for 8 weeks, with B. areolata fed a control diet (RP0) and four diets containing four different RP formulations, with doses of 1 (RP1), 5 (RP2), 10 (RP3), and 20 (RP4) g/kg, respectively. Higher levels of R. palustris in the formulation led to increased final weight, weight gain, and specific growth rate in B. areolata. The crude protein content was significantly higher in the RP4 group compared to the RP0 group. However, there was no significant difference in the crude lipid content. Higher levels of R. palustris in the RP4 formulation group increased the trypsin and lipase activities. Dietary supplementation with RP significantly increased the total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities and decreased the malondialdehyde content in B. areolata. Acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase activities were significantly increased in the RP4 group compared to the RP0 group. Dietary RP significantly increased the expression levels of antioxidant-related (superoxide dismutase, Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase A-like, ferritin) and immune-related (acid phosphatase, cytochrome c) genes. Higher levels of R. palustris in the formulations RP3 and RP4 increased the survival rate of B. areolata challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus.

Six isonitrogenous and isoenergetic experimental diets (43% crude protein and 15.46 kJ/g diet) using Pollack fish oil as the lipid source, were formulated to contain six lipid levels (1.83, 3.83, 5.91,7.80, 9.76 and 11.73% dry diet, respectively). Triplicate groups of 50 shells (average weight 160.50 +/- 1.20 mg) were stocked in 120-1 tanks and fed to apparent satiation twice daily for 10 weeks. The results showed that growth performance and feed utilization were significantly affected by dietary lipid levels (P < 0.05). Maximum weight gain, mean protein gain and specific growth rate occurred at 5.91% dietary lipid level (P < 0.05), soft body to shell ratios were not significantly difference above 3.83% dietary lipid level, and there were no significant differences (P < 0.05) in survival of ivory shell fed the experimental diets. There were significant difference in protein, lipid, moisture and ash content in soft body (P < 0.05). Lipid content in soft body positively correlated with dietary lipid level, however, protein and ash content in soft body significantly decreased with the increase in dietary lipid level. Pepsin activity in soft body significantly increased with dietary lipid level increasing from 1.83 to 7.80%, and trypsinlike enzyme activity significantly increased with increase in dietary lipid level from 1.83 to 5.91%. However, lipase activity in soft body increased with an increase in dietary lipid level, but amylase activity was not significantly affected by the dietary lipid level. The results of this trial indicated that dietary lipid levels above 7.80% dry matter did not improve growth performance or feed utilization of juvenile ivory shell. Quadratic regression analysis of mean protein gain against dietary lipid level indicated that the optimal dietary lipid requirement for maximum mean protein gain of juvenile ivory shell is about 6.54% of dry diet.

Although there are numerous studies on abalone nutrition, most tend to focus on animal growth and nutrient utilization. A more holistic research approach to ensure a sustainable future for this industry will require the development of feeds that provide integrated nutrition and health benefits.

The results showed that E. maxima was the most defended and of intermediate food value, L. pallida was poorly defended and of low food value, and P. capensis had almost no defenses and was of the highest food value. Abalone preferred P. capensis to either of the other two algae. Food preference was influenced by the diet on which the animals had been fed before the experiment.

Performance relates directly to the nutritional value of algae - or any feedstock - which in turn is driven by the amino acid content and profile, and specifically the content of the limiting essential amino acids. However, the relationship between feeding preferences, consumption and amino acid content of algae have rarely been simultaneously investigated for abalone, and never for the emerging target species Haliotis asinina. Here we found that the tropical H. asinina had strong and consistent preferences for the red alga Hypnea pannosa and the green alga Ulva flexuosa, but no overarching relationship between protein content (sum of amino acids) and preference existed. For example, preferred Hypnea and Ulva had distinctly different protein contents (12.64 vs. 2.99 g 100 g(-1)) and the protein-rich Asparagopsis taxiformis (>15 g 100 g(-1) of dry weight) was one of the least preferred algae. The limiting amino acid in all algae was methionine, followed by histidine or lysine. Furthermore we demonstrated that preferences can largely be removed using carrageenan as a binder for dried alga, most likely acting as a feeding attractant or stimulant.

However, the growth rates of abalone fed on four diatom species, which were readily digested, were higher than those of abalone fed on the other five species of diatom. The cell walls of the former four diatom species were easily broken open when they were grazed by abalone because of their high adhesive strength (three species), or due to the weakly silicified cell walls (one species with a low adhesive strength). The other five species, whose adhesive strengths are low, were easily ingested by abalone without any deformation of the cell walls and the majority of them were excreted whole and still alive. It is considered that post-larval abalone cannot digest diatom cell contents in their alimentary canal without first rupturing the cell wall with the radula.

Hybridization is an effective way of improving germplasm in aquaculture, as it often generates desirable traits in the hybrids, including increased disease resistance. This study analyzed the dynamic changes in several immune indexes, including the survival rate, total hemocyte count (THC), hemocyte mortality, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and hemolymphatic pathogenic bacteria content, in two parental populations, Thailand B. areolata (TT) and Hainan B. areolata (HH), and their reciprocal hybrids, Thailand B. areolata female x Hainan B. areolata male (TH) and Hainan B. areolata female x Thailand B. areolata male (HT), challenged with Vibrio harveyi, the main pathogenic bacterial species affecting B. areolata.

The changes in non-specific immune parameters showed that under control conditions, HT had a higher THC than the other three populations and that it maintained this level throughout the infection process, while HH and HT showed significantly lower hemocyte mortality rates and higher ROS levels than TT and TH. In addition, the pathogenic Vibrio (V. harveyi) count in the hemolymph of the four populations increased sharply to a peak value and then slowly decreased after infection. Compared with the control groups, the change rates of the cumulative total pathogen content in the hemolymph were in the order TT > TH > HH > HT at 72 h after infection, indicating that HT suppressed and eliminated pathogenic microorganisms most effectively. HT may have inherited the more efficient non-specific immune function from HH.

However, the role of chemical defences in filamentous algae has received far less attention. We investigated possible chemical feeding deterrence by filamentous red algae that have conspicuous cellular inclusions (Asparagopsis armata, Anotrichium tenue and Balliella amphiglanda) and 2 others without inclusions (Callithamnion korfense and Ulva sp.). The 3 algae with cellular inclusions were consumed at lower rates by a generalist amphipod, Hyale nigra, than the other 2 algae. To determine the potential role of chemical defences for A. armata, we conducted tests against herbivores using algae in which the production of halogenated metabolites was manipulated. This manipulation had no effect on carbon and nitrogen values of the algae, and allowed us to directly test the role of algal secondary metabolites in defence against herbivores without using artificial diets. Bromide (+) algae (with halogenated metabolites) deterred grazing by 2 mesograzers (Hyale nigra and juvenile abalone Haliotis rubra), which consumed up to 4 times more bromide (-) (metabolite-free) algae than bromide (+) algae. Juveniles of the sea hare Aplysia parvula were not deterred by the chemical defences in bromide (+) A. armata. In field assays, artificial diets containing a crude extract of A. armata were also active against herbivores. Although functional form models typically predict that tolerance - not resistance - should be the key defensive strategy for marine algae with simple architecture, this study demonstrates that resistance traits may also be important and more broadly utilised in filamentous species.",10.3354/meps323001,"de Nys, Rocky/0000-0003-3869-4928; Paul, Nicholas/0000-0002-9275-1535; Steinberg, Peter/0000-0002-1781-0726",0171-8630,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps323001,

We compared the responses of unselected farmed and wild abalone to stressors that occur on farms. The aim was to determine if the farm environment had induced differences in the behavioural or physiological performances of the abalone. Thirty hatchery-born 3.5 year-old abalone and thirty wild ones were reared under standard farm conditions for 6 months and characterised for 19 traits related to growth, survival, behaviour and immunology. Behavioural and immunological responses to stressors differed between the two stocks. Farmed abalone retracted and swivelled less in reaction to a finger contact. Phagocytosis efficiency was reduced by shaking in abalone from both origins, but the farmed stock returned to the basal level after the recovery week, while wild abalone did not, and a rise of total haemocyte count after shaking and its return to a basal level after one week was only observed for the farmed stock. This indicates that both behaviour and immune responses following a stress have been affected by the farming practices. This suggests that a domestication process has already been initiated in the farmed stock.

This is a particular concern for aquaculture industries due to the economic impacts of such events. Diets containing algal supplements have been suggested as pre-emptive solutions for preventing these mass mortalities. The same has also been suggested for diets containing grape seed extract. This is due to their potential as a source of antioxidative compounds, which reduce the accumulation of harmful reactive oxygen species. This study aimed to identify functional genes associated with high survival in abalone fed diets high in antioxidative compounds during heat stress. Tentacle transcriptomes of 40 greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) were investigated to determine the combined effects of differing diets and temperature on the gene expression responses by abalone. Here we compare the functional gene expression changes at 22 degrees C and 25 degrees C in abalone fed common commercial, live macroalgal (Ulva lactuca) and grape seed extract supplemented commercial diets as a means to understand the resulting high survival of abalone fed grape seed extract during heat stress. Twenty-four genes were differentially expressed between high survival promoting diets (macroalgae or grape seed extract supplemented commercial) relative to the purely commercial diet. Many of these genes have been suggested to be involved in antioxidant and innate immunity responses. The identification of these genes and their functional roles has enhanced our understanding of processes that contribute to summer stress resilience in abalone.

About 53,300 progeny representing 533 full-sib families from the mating between 308 sires and 533 dams were tested in concrete tanks for five generations. Breeding candidates in the base generation (G(0)) and first generation (G(1)) were selected based on their estimated breeding values for growth (recorded as shell length at tagging and harvest), while those in later generations (G(2)-G(3)) were selected according to a selection index including individual breeding values for growth and family breeding values for survival traits. Variance components and genetic parameters were estimated using animal models and the restricted maximum-likelihood method. The breeding values of all animals over five generations were estimated using the best linear unbiased prediction. Within generations, the heritability estimates for square root transformed tagging shell length and harvest shell length were moderate, ranging from 0.125 to 0.237 and from 0.196 to 0.308, respectively. Across generations, the heritability estimates for the two growth traits were relatively low; 0.109 and 0.169, respectively, and the heritability of survival was low (0.069), but suggestive of a significant additive genetic component. Including all data, the effects common to full-sibs other than additive genetic effects (c(2)) accounted for 5.1%, 2.6% and 3.1% of the total phenotypic variance for transformed tagging shell length, harvest shell length and survival traits, respectively, and the three values were significantly different from zero (P < 0.05). Genetic correlations of harvest shell length with tagging shell length and survival were favorable and significantly different from zero; 0.633 and 0.467, respectively.

The effect of diet on the gonad development of 27-month-old farmed Haliotis midae, raised at two stocking densities, was analysed. We fed two artificial diets and a natural diet, kelp, to cultured abalone. The first artificial diet had fishmeal as its main source of protein, while in the other, Abfeed (R) S34, 32% of the fish meal was replaced with soya meal. For each gonad sample, the development phase was determined based on both histological criteria and the gonad bulk index (GBIn).

The morphology of the organic interlayer is characterized by scanning electron microscopy. These results enable a realistic depiction of the formation of the terraced cones that comprise the principal biomineralization mechanism in this gastropod. In all cases, the growth initiated through spherulites, followed by tile formation. The transient stage with spherulitic formation was shorter at higher temperature; this is indicative of a greater activity of the animal at 21 degrees C. The growth rate in a normally fed gastropod was found to be higher compared with one provided with limited food. The effect of water temperature (seasonal) was also established, with growth proceeding faster in the summer (T-21 degrees C) than in winter (15 degrees C).

The purpose of this study was to determine the growth and survival of juvenile queen conchs fed artificial diets with increasing levels of a red alga Agardhiella sp. Agardhiella, soy protein isolate, and fish oil were increased at the expense of catfish feed, wheat flour, or both to keep the diets isonitrogenous (38% crude protein [CP]) with increasing protein to energy ratios (83-96 mg CP/kcal). Yttrium was also incorporated as an inert marker for determining the digestibility of dietary nutrients. Juvenile queen conchs were stocked at 75/m2 for a total of 16 conchs per replicate (three replicates) and were fed 125 mg of diet per conch each day for 6 months. Dietary crude protein ranged from 31% to 38%. The dietary lipid, moisture, energy, ash, fiber, carbohydrate, and yttrium in each diet were also determined. Juvenile conchs were measured (shell length and wet weight) every 6 weeks. At the end of the experiment, feces were collected to determine protein, energy, and dry matter digestibility. Results indicated the highest growth rates (0.10 mm/d and 0.11 mm/d) and survival were for conchs that were fed diets containing a soy protein isolate protein substitution of 15% or less.

The highest growth was observed for postlarvae fed the MIX (51.37 mu m day(-1) and 0.578 +/- 0.1 mg day(-1)), but was not significantly different from the NAV treatments (46.60 +/- 3.4 gm day(-1) and 0.550 +/- 0.1 mg day(-1)). Abalone larvae, which are lecithotrophic organisms, seem to utilize proteins as a preferred energy substrate up to metamorphosis, since the relative lipid content increased from 15 to 30% from days 0 to 10. Thereafter, lipids are rapidly utilized and decreased to a level of 2% of the dry matter in the postlarvae whole soft tissue. Tissue fatty acid analysis indicated a similar trend among treatments, where relative fatty acid levels increased during the endogenous feeding period and started to decrease concomitant with the start of the exogenous feeding. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, reported on abalone tissue showed a similar trend, among treatments. Based on the results reported here, it can be concluded that the type of diatom is an important factor for growth, where a high lipid and low ash content could be important to improve the performance in terms of growth and survival, in combination to stimulate protease activity and therefore better digestibility. Last but not the least important, the use of monoculture with NAV will be of importance when culturing abalone postlarvae. The estimated energy budget, back calculated from the digestibility figures, indicates that abalone requires from 25 to 38 cal day(-1) g abalone(-1) for adequate growth. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We used 3 bait types (abalone viscera, pilchards and crushed urchin) and quantified commonly used metrics for the fish assemblage, including species richness, time of first arrival and relative abundance on 3 shallow rocky reefs in southeastern Australia over 2 yr. We distinguished the following 6 feeding guilds: herbivore, zooplanktivore, alga/invertebrate consumers, invertebrate carnivore, macroinvertebrate carnivore and generalist carnivore. The response of fishes was dependent on bait type, with urchin bait performing particularly poorly. Although we did not detect statistical differences between the performance of pilchards and abalone viscera as bait, pilchards produced more consistent outcomes. Importantly, we also observed strong spatial effects. In general, bait type had a marked effect on species richness, but little influence on relative abundance.

This study assessed the survival rate and weight loss rate (WLR) of abalone under various treatments to determine the optimal packaging transport conditions. Specifically, temperature, supplemental humidity and oxygen, and air exposure during simulated live transport were investigated. Results revealed that the survival rate increased significantly after cold-water shock and humidity control, whereas oxygen supplements did not have a significant effect. In addition, WLR significantly increased over time (P < 0.05). An additional experiment was conducted to investigate the stress response caused by air exposure. Hemocyte parameters, including total hemocyte count (THC), hemocyte mortality, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), were estimated for 2, 6, 12, 24, and 30 h after air exposure at different temperatures. Results revealed that THC significantly decreased after 30 h of air exposure at 5 and 10 degrees C, and after 24 h of air exposure at 20 degrees C. Hemocyte mortality and ROS significantly increased, peaking after 30 h at 5 and 10 degrees C, followed by a gradual decrease over the subsequent 24 h recovery period. THC and ROS levels remained higher than the control levels by the end of the recovery period.

Hence, the aim of the present work is to study the possibility of replacing kelp meal in the abalone diet with a regional winery by-product. Five diets were formulated in which kelp meal was substituted from 0% to 100%, at a maximum of 33% of the total of ingredients; 375 abalone (15.09 +/- 0.38 mm and 0.434 +/- 0.03 g) were used, randomly distributed in fifteen 8-L plastic buckets. After 60 days of experimentation, significant differences were detected in the slopes of the different treatments for both length and weight. Since the inclusion of the winery by-product resulted in a lower feed ingestion but the feed conversion efficiency remained constant, a factor of low palatability can be attributed to the winery by-product and not an antinutritional factor. It is concluded that the winery by-product can be substituted for kelp meal in 16% of the total diet without having a negative effect on the growth of the organisms.",10.7773/cm.v30i12.105,"Viana, Maria Teresa/0000-0002-3074-767X",0185-3880,,,MAR,http://dx.doi.org/10.7773/cm.v30i12.105,

The inferences of natural diets indicated that benthic diatoms, small red macroalgae and (or) juvenile brown macroalgae, and adult brown macroalgae were the primary food sources for small juveniles (6.5 +/- 1.0 min SL), large juveniles (23.7 +/- 6.1 mm SL), and adults (81.8 +/- 14.3 mm SL), respectively. The changes of delta(13)C in abalone were similar among three sampling stations and were explained by ontogenetic changes in feeding habits. The decrease of delta(13)C in abalone (<= 20 mm SL) indicated a transition from diatom feeding to juvenile brown macroalgae and (or) small red macroalgae feeding, whereas the subsequent increase of delta(13)C (>20 mm SL) represented a feeding transition to adult brown macroalgae.

Recent transcriptome analyses have revealed neuropeptide genes with potential roles in vertebrate and invertebrate growth and reproduction. Among these genes, haliotid growth-associated peptide (HGAP) was identified as a novel gene in abalone. Methods: This study focused on HGAP in Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), where the complete cDNA sequence named Hdh-HGAP was identified and characterized. Samples from different experiments, such as metamorphosis, juvenile abalone growth, gonad development stages, muscle remodeling, and starvation, were collected for mRNA expression analysis. Results: The sequence spans 552 bp, encoding 96 amino acids with a molecular weight of 10.96 kDa. Expression analysis revealed that Hdh-HGAP exhibited higher levels in muscle tissue. Notably, during metamorphosis, Hdh-HGAP exhibited greater expression in the trochophore, veliger, and juvenile stages than in the cell division stages. Regarding growth patterns, Hdh-HGAP was highly expressed during rapid growth compared to stunted, minimal, and normal growth. In gonadal development, Hdh-HGAP mRNA reached its highest expression level during the ripening stage, indicating a potential role in gonadal cell proliferation and maturation. The in vivo effects of GnRH on gonad development and the expression of the Hdh-HGAP neuropeptide indicate its involvement in regulating reproduction in Pacific abalone. While tissue remodeling is primarily governed by immune genes, Hdh-HGAP was also upregulated during muscle tissue remodeling. Conversely, Hdh-HGAP was downregulated during prolonged starvation. Conclusion: This study marks the first comprehensive exploration of the Hdh-HGAP neuropeptide gene in Pacific abalone, shedding light on its involvement in growth, reproduction, metamorphosis, tissue remodeling, and response to starvation, although regulatory mechanisms are mostly unknown.",10.1159/000535945,"Hossen, Shaharior/0000-0003-3581-2271",0028-3835,1423-0194,,JAN,http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000535945,38142675

By demonstrating the environmental stressors tested, the immune parameters typically investigated, and the species that have received the greatest level of investigation, this review provides a critical assessment of the field of marine invertebrate ecological immunology. In highlighting the methodologies employed within this field, our current inability to understand the true ecological significance of any immune dysfunction caused by environmental stressors is outlined. Additionally, a number of examples are provided in which studies successfully demonstrate a measure of immunocompetence through alterations in disease resistance and organism survival to a realized pathogenic threat. Consequently, this review highlights the potential to advance our current understanding of the ecological and evolutionary significance of environmental stressor related immune dysfunction. Furthermore, the potential for the advancement of our understanding of the immune system of marine invertebrates, through the incorporation of newly emerging and novel molecular techniques, is emphasized.

The diets consisted of alginate and either the probiotic V. midae K811 only (diet 1), a mixture of the benthic diatom Cocconeis sp. and Vibrio midae K811 (diet 2) or Cocconeis sp. only (diatom control diet). Abalone survival was monitored over 25 days, and growth was quantified by measuring abalone shell length. Results confirmed that V. midae K811 has a probiotic effect on post-larval H. midae by significantly improving survival and promoting a three-fold increase in the growth rate of these animals. This study also demonstrated that post-larval H. midae can survive and grow on a bacterial biofilm diet lacking diatom cells which might suggest that bacteria could replace diatoms as the principle food source for post-larval H. midae.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.734929,"Moxley, Karis/0000-0002-9456-686X; Coyne, Vernon/0000-0002-2050-8683",0044-8486,1873-5622,,Mar-30,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.734929,

However, the effects of dietary astaxanthin supplementation from different sources are still unknown. A comprehensive comparison of survival, growth, immune response, antioxidant activity, thermal resistance, disease resistance, and intestinal microbial structure was conducted in dietary antioxidant supplementation from the sources of Gracilaria lemaneiformis (GL), industrial synthetic astaxanthin (80 mg/kg astaxanthin actual weight, named as group 'SA80'), Phaffia rhodozyma (80 mg/kg astaxanthin actual weight, named as group 'PR80') and Haematococcus pluvialis (120 mg/kg astaxanthin actual weight, named as group 'HP120') at their optimal supplementation amounts. Furthermore, the SA80, PR80, and HP120 groups performed better in all aspects, including survival, growth, immune response, antioxidant activity, thermal resistance, and disease resistance, compared with the GL group. The PR80 and HP120 group also had a better growth performance than the SA80 group. In terms of heat stress and bacterial challenge, abalone in the PR80 group showed the strongest resistance. Overall, 80 mg/kg astaxanthin supplementation from Phaffia rhodozyma was recommended to obtain a more effective and comprehensive outcome. This study contributes to the discovery of the optimum dietary astaxanthin supplementation source for abalone, which is helpful to improve the production efficiency and economic benefits of abalone.

The immobilized diatoms remained alive and maintained their capacity to multiply after I year of storage in absolute darkness at 4 'C without liquid media. These diatoms were subsequently applied as feed to cultivate post-larvae of H. diversicolor.

The effects of these algal diets on the free amino acid (FAA) profiles inthe viscera and muscle of animals were investigated. To find a suitable index to evaluate the protein quality of natural diets for algivores, several indices were computed and correlated to the growth performance of abalone using correlation analysis. These two species of abalone have a very similar amino acid composition, indicating that they may have similar amino acid requirements. In all the selected algae, arginine may be the limiting amino acid, and in some instances methionine, threonine or histidine may be also limiting. Judging from the results of feeding test and amino acid analysis, P. palmata and A. esculenta seem to have the better amino acid pattern and availability among the selected algae. On the other hand, U. lactuca and C. crispus appear to be poor in their amino acid availability and/or pattern. Dietary treatments significantly affected the FAA profiles in animal tissues.

Six experimental diets were formulated containing 33.50 % of different carbohydrate sources including dextrin, pregelatinized wheat starch, wheat starch, tapioca starch, potato starch and corn starch. The diets were fed to the abalone with an initial weight of 3.42 f 0.02 g in triplicate tanks for 24 weeks, housed in a recirculation system, with seawater maintained at 18-20 degrees C. There were no significant differences detected in the average daily increment in shell length (DISL, mu m/day) or survival of abalone fed the six treatments containing different carbohydrate sources. However, there were significant differences detected in the average final weight and weight gain rate (WGR, %) parameters, with the lowest final weight (8.16 f 0.29 g) and WGR (140.38 f 6.57 %) observed in the potato starch fed abalone.

There was no significant difference found in the soft-tissue lipid content (5.84-6.87 %). The dextrin-based diet led to elevated plasma glucose (0.85 f 0.06 mmol/l) in abalone compared with the other treatment groups. The concentration of muscle glycogen in abalone fed with pregelatinized wheat starch showed the highest values with 78.45 f 1.53 mg/g tissue, which was significantly different to the other treatment groups, however, the digestive gland glycogen content (15.56-19.27 mg/g tissue) was maintained at a constant level regardless of the dietary carbohydrate sources.

Our study confirmed that carotenoids in abalones mainly come from diets, and the carotenoid types in the muscles were similar to their diets. We also found that feeding on G.lemaneiformis played an important role in maintaining a stable carotenoid content over time, especially zeaxanthin in H.gigantea. Our data also provided that abalones had a good growth performance under the feeding conditions of G.lemaneiformis.

This study aimed to assess the effect of different feeding regimes on the reproductive performance of Tripneustes gratilla. To achieve this, broodstock animals were conditioned on four diets [formulated feed, kelp (Ecklonia maxima), green seaweed (Ulva lacinulata) and mixture of the three diets] for four months, and various broodstock traits, including gonad development, gonad coloration, gamete (egg and sperm) quality, egg energetic components and egg fatty acids were assessed. In this study, broodstock animals fed natural feeds and a mixed feeding regime had greater gonad and egg redness indices, possibly as a result of dietary carotenoids being incorporated into their gonads. These pigments have known antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, pro-vitamin A, photoprotection and immunity-related roles. Results from this study showed that a formulated feed (20U) should not be fed in isolation for reproductive purposes, as these broodstock animals displayed lower gonad and egg quality indices. Furthermore, this diet showed poor fatty acid provisioning, with an excess linoleic acid being detected in eggs. In contrast, animals fed a mixed diet displayed the most diverse egg fatty acid profile, with a high proportion of fatty acids commonly found in sea urchins, such as palmitic acid, myristic acid and the omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid.

This fatal disease for abalone is produced by a rickettsia-like organism (WS-RLO), the bacterium Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis. To evaluate the potential of the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) to improve its resistance to infection by WS-RLO, the additive genetic component in the variation of this trait was estimated. For this, the variation in infection intensity with WS-RLOs and WS-RLOv (phage-infected RLOs) was analyzed in 56 families of full-sibs maintained for three years in a host-parasite cohabitation aquaculture system. A WS-RLO prevalence of 65% was observed in the analysed population; and from the total WS-RLO inclusions 60% were hyperparasited with the phage (WS-RLOv). The decrease in the food ingestion rate was the sole negative effect associated with increasing WS-RLO intensity of infection, suggesting that the high level of WS-RLOv load may have diminished the symptoms of WS disease in the analyzed abalones. The estimated heritabilities were moderate to mid, but significant, varying from 0.21 to 0.23 and 0.36 for WS-RLO and WS-RLOv infections, respectively. This suggests that variation in resistance to infection with WS-RLO may respond to selection in the evaluated red abalone population. Estimated response to selection (G) for the level of infection by WS-RLO indicated that if the 10% of red abalone with the lowest infection level is selected as broodstock, a 90% reduction in the intensity of infection in the progeny can be expected, even with the lowest estimation of heritability (h(2) = 0.21). This strong response would be also due to the large phenotypic variance of this trait. Strong positive correlations, both phenotypic and genotypic, were observed between infection intensities with WS-RLO and WS-RLOv, indicating that selection to increase resistance to one of the types of RLOs will affect resistance in the other in the same direction. This is the first study that demonstrates the existence of additive genetic variation for resistance to WS-RLO in abalone. Consequently, it is possible to increase the resistance to WS-RLO in H. rufescens by selective breeding, which can be an economically attractive and environmentally friendly manner to reduce mortalities and growth effects caused by WS in abalone farms.",10.1016/j.jip.2017.08.014,"Farias, William/0000-0002-6360-2231; Brokordt, Katherina/0000-0003-3773-2064",0022-2011,1096-0805,,NOV,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2017.08.014,28870439

MAPK1 is a member of the extracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERKs), playing roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and development. This is mainly in response to growth factors, mitogens, and many environmental stresses. In the current study, we have characterized the structural features of a homolog of MAPK1 from disk abalone (AbMAPK1). Further, we have unraveled its expressional kinetics against different experimental pathogenic infections or related chemical stimulants. AbMAPK1 harbors a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 23 bps, a coding sequence of 1104 bps, and a 3' UTR of 448 bp. The putative peptide comprises a predicted molecular mass of 42.2 kDa, with a theoretical pI of 6.28. Based on the in silica analysis, AbMAPK1 possesses two N-glycosylation sites, one S_TK catalytic domain, and a conserved His-Arg-Asp domain (HRD). In addition, a conservative glycine rich ATP phosphate -binding loop and a threonine-x-tyrosine motif (TEY) important for the autophosphorylation were also identified in the protein. Homology assessment of AbMAPK1 showed several conserved regions, and ark clam (Aplysia californica) showed the highest sequence identity (87.9%). The phylogenetic analysis supported close evolutionary kinship with molluscan orthologs. Constitutive expression of AbMAPK1 was observed in six different tissues of disk abalone, with the highest expression in the digestive tract, followed by the gills and hemocytes. Highest AbMAPIC1 mRNA expression level was detected at the trochophore developmental stage, suggesting its role in abalone cell differentiation and proliferation. Significant modulation of AbMAPK1 expression under pathogenic stress suggested its putative involvement in the immune defense mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The cephalic, epipodial and mantle tentacles bear papillae with ciliary tufts at their tips. Chemoreceptors with 14-21 ciliated cells were found at high density on the snout. When the tentacles were touched with a bamboo rod or a piece of plastic sheet, the abalone contracted the tentacle stimulated, indicating mechanoreception. The contact of a piece of brown algae Laminaria japonica to any of three tentacles elicited a typical feeding response: shell lifting, pedal sole expansion and lifting, and food seizing with pedal sole. The response disappeared when the algae was separated from the tentacles, indicating that the ciliated cells were contact chemoreceptors as well as mechanoreceptors. A possibility of distant chemoreception was examined in a Y-maze in which seawater flowed over the algae and was directed towards the abalone. The algal stimulant triggered the food searching movement of the abalone which randomly chose both the stimulant containing water from the algal containing side and the control water without stimulant. This implies the possession of distant chemoreception possibly by the osphradium, but the abalone lacks a function to detect the origin of the smell.",10.2331/suisan.76.185,,0021-5392,1349-998X,,MAR,http://dx.doi.org/10.2331/suisan.76.185,

The immune- stimulating potential of two hydrolysed protein sources (self-prepared fish silage and a commercial fish protein hydrolysate) at two dietary inclusion levels in abalone diets was therefore measured in the South African abalone Haliotis midae, using animals of initial mean weight of 123 g-128 g. Diets containing the high inclusion levels were also fed in two feeding regimes: continuous feeding, or phase feeding, where the hydrolysed protein diets were alternated monthly with the control diet. In low inclusion diets, hydrolysate inclusion contributed 6 g center dot kg(-1) protein in the final diet, whilst in high inclusion diets this was increased to 18 g center dot kg(-1). It was found that the low inclusion level of the commercial hydrolysate significantly increased the cellular immunity through increasing the phagocytic activity of haemocytes by 18% compared to the control diet, whilst none of the other diets showed any significant differences compared to the control. Both inclusion levels of the commercial hydrolysed protein significantly improved daily weight increase of animals. Phase feeding had no positive impacts on immunity or production performance. The inclusion of both types of hydrolysed protein sources significantly decreased the water stability of feeds compared to the control, except at the lowest inclusion level of the commercial hydrolysate. It is concluded that the use of dietary hydrolysed proteins can lead to improved cellular immunity and growth in abalone, however it is important to determine appropriate inclusion levels to prevent negative impacts on feed water stability and production performance.

The 32-week trial was divided into two phases, a somatic growth phase (20 weeks) and a gonad enhancement phase (12 weeks), with different combinations of feeds tested during each phase. The five feeding regimes included an FU only treatment for 32 weeks; FU for 20 weeks followed by the 20U diet for 12 weeks (FU- 20U); and, similarly, FU-0U, 20U-FU and 0U-FU treatment regimes for 20 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively. Comparable somatic growth was recorded during the first 20 weeks of the trial from ju-venile/small adult urchins fed the formulated feed containing Ulva (20U) and the fresh Ulva (FU) diet; whereas a formulated feed with the same nutritional properties, but without the addition of Ulva (0U), produced urchins that were significantly smaller. Gonad production during the first 20 weeks of the trial was higher for urchins fed formulated feeds (0U and 20U); however, the reduced test size of urchins fed the 0U diet resulted in a significantly reduced gonad mass. Following the change in diets at 20 weeks, both gonad size and colour were significantly affected. Formulated feeds promoted gonad growth of urchins previously fed FU, while administration of FU improved gonad colour of urchins previously fed the formulated diets. The FU only treatment produced gonads with the most desirable colour, but these gonads were smaller in size compared with urchins fed dry formulated feeds. These data suggest that the use of high protein formulated diets during the somatic growth phase of small adult urchins is not necessary, as comparable growth can be produced by feeding Ulva. Gonad production on a diet of Ulva alone, however, is significantly lower than that obtained using a formulated diet. It is therefore recommended that FU is used for the somatic growth phases of this species, while formulated feeds, especially the 20U diet, are used subsequently for gonad development and/or enhancement. Statement of relevance: The combination of sea urchin/Ulva systems will be very beneficial to the commercial production of Tripneustes gratilla, in terms of lowering farm operational costs, as fresh Ulva armoricana can produce better/comparable somatic growth to high protein (26%) formulated feeds (0U and 20U). Dry formulated feeds such as 20U should be used at the end of cultivation as a finishing feed, 2 months prior to harvest, to enhance gonad growth and increase product yield. Findings from this study will contribute to lowering operating costs and help to improve the commercial success of echinoculture operations, focused on the production of T. gratilla, in South Africa and around the world.

The impact of algal supplementation on hemolymph immunity was mainly represented by a drop in total hemocyte counts (THC) and some diet specific effects on superoxide anion and antibacterial activity against Vibrio anguillarum. No effect of diet was observed on phagocytosis, phenoloxidase, or antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1. It is conceived that the humoral antimicrobial factors in abalone hemolymph are innately biosynthesized rather than dietary derived compounds. Nevertheless, concomitant with strong antiviral activity against HSV-1 in a lipophilic extract of U. lactuca and S. filamentosa, higher antiviral activity was detected in the digestive lipid extract of abalone fed U. lactuca (64.2% at 650 mu g ml(-1)) or S. filamentosa (69.51%) compared to abalone fed pellets (47.42%) or pellets supplemented with A. maxima (46.3%) or D. sauna (46%). This suggests that abalone may also derive some protection against oral pathogens by algal derived bioactive compounds. These results indicate that abalone growth rate could be optimized by A. maxima and D. salina supplementations, whereas U. lactuca and S. filamentosa could be useful supplements for abalone aquaculture, especially in areas with high risk of herpesvirus infection.

Each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate groups of abalone and fed to abalone every other day for 16 weeks. After the 16week feeding trial, abalone were subjected to air exposure for 24 h, and then survival was monitored for the next 6 days. All formulated diets achieved greater weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) than those of abalone fed the S. japonica. Weight gain and SGR of abalone linearly improved with dietary increased substitution levels of S. japonica with CEB. Shell growth of abalone tended to agree with growth rate. The chemical composition of the soft body of abalone was not affected by the experimental diets. Survival of abalone fed all formulated diets was (P < 0.05) higher than that of abalone fed S. japonica at the end of the 6-day post observation period after the 24-h air exposure.

Each library has an average of 53,361,675 clean reads. Approximately 85.71% reads were mapped to the reference genome of Haliotis discus hannai Ino. In comparison with A0h group, 7,656 and 2,789 genes were differentially expressed in the A8h and A48h groups, respectively. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mostly enriched in oxidation-reduction process and oxidoreductase activity from GO analysis as well as immunity and metabolism-related pathways from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis. Cluster analysis demonstrated that all DEGs were categorized into eight subclusters by adopting the gene expression model. Specifically, a total of 1,070 significantly downregulated genes from two clusters were related to some metabolic pathways, ABC transporters, and cell adhesion. Moreover, 212 upregulated genes in one subcluster were enriched in several immune-related pathways, including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling pathway and apoptosis. Some members of the pattern recognition receptors family, which can initiate inflammatory signaling and induce apoptosis, were stimulated to upregulate in gill after challenge including C1q, perlucin, and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein.

However, a limited occurrence of the orange-footed muscle trait makes it a valuable candidate for breeding programs. In our research, we examined the inheritance pattern of the orange-footed trait and conducted a 90-day feeding trial for H. gigantea to compare the influence of formulated feed and macroalgae on pigment enrichment and growth rates. Our results suggest that the orange-footed trait has a recessive nature relative to its common counterpart and demonstrates stable inheritance. We also identified a significant correlation between color-difference values (a*) and total carotenoid content (TCC) (R-2 = 0.955, p < 0.05), suggesting the TCC in abalone foot muscle can be estimated using the a* value. Furthermore, introducing carotenoids to formulated feed imparts an orange hue to the foot muscle, but this effect is inferior compared to using Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis with a similar carotenoid content. This suggests that H. gigantea has a higher absorption efficiency for the carotenoids from the macroalgae G. lemaneiformis compared to formulated feed. Growth assessments indicate that the formulated feed, enriched with higher crude protein than G. lemaneiformis, optimally supports H. gigantea growth.

We aimed to determine if dietary intervention could alleviate mortality demonstrated by abalone at high water temperatures. As this issue is most relevant to farm production, we aimed to demonstrate that different mortality patterns are evident for 2- and 3-year-old greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata Donovan), irrespective of reproductive state, and to provide potential, practical solutions to this issue. Growth rate, feed intake and haemolymph variables were measured. To test if dietary intervention could minimise mortality at high water temperatures, we selected a commercial diet routinely fed on-farm when SM occurred, as a negative survival control, and live macroalgae (Ulva lactuca Linnaeus) as a positive survival control. In Experiment 1, 30 mm 2-year-old and 70 mm 3-year-old abalone were subjected to water temperatures of 18, 22 and 26 degrees C for 36 days. In Experiment 2, 60 mm 3-year-olds were subjected to 22 and 26 degrees C for 38 days. In Experiment 1, survival was > 95% for all treatments at 18 and 22 degrees C (P > 0.05); whereas, survival was significantly reduced by 35% in 3-year-olds fed the commercial diet at 26 degrees C compared to all other treatments (P < 0.05).

The results showed that the average weight gain rate (WGR, %), daily increment in shell length (DISL, mum/day), soft-body alkaline phosphatase activity (SBAKP, U/g protein) and soft-body zinc concentration (SB zinc, mug/g) of the abalone were significantly (ANOVA, P < 0.01) affected by dietary treatment, and responded in broken-line models to increases in dietary zinc levels from the two zinc sources. The requirements for dietary zinc using ZnMet and ZnSO4 as the supplemental zinc sources, determined by broken-line regression analysis, on the basis of maximum WGR were 15.49 and 34.10 mg/kg, respectively, on maximum DISL were 15.16 and 33.99 mg/kg, respectively, on maximum SBAKP were 15.54 and 31.91 mg/kg, and on maximum SE zinc deposition were 17.75 and 34.29 mg/kg, respectively. The shell zinc concentration, as well as iron concentration in soft-body and shell of the abalone, however, was maintained relatively constant (ANOVA, P > 0.05) regardless of dietary treatment. Based on these results, a minimum requirement for dietary zinc was recommended to be 16-18 mg/kg from ZnMet, and 35 mg/kg from ZnSO4. This experiment also showed that the bioavailability of dietary zinc with ZnMet was approximately three times as high as that of ZnSO4 to H. discus hannai Ino. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Six groups of leeches housed in tanks were randomly divided into five treatment groups (fed a basal diet supplemented with 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, or 12.5 g/kg of Radix Isatidis) and one control group (fed a basal diet). Compared with the control group, the specific growth rate (SGR) and weight gain (WG) were significantly decreased in the treatment groups supplemented with Radix Isatidis. However, supplementation with 2.5 to 10.0 g/kg of Radix Isatidis did not produce an effect on mortality. Mortality was recorded after the leeches were challenged with P. mirabilis, and changes were observed in the serum cortisol, glucose, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 3,5,30-triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxin (T4), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total protein (TP), globin, and lysozyme contents. In the ingluvies, changes were observed in the total anti-oxidative capacity, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene expression over a period of 7 d. Treatment with 5.0 to 10.0 g/kg of Radix Isatidis increased the following parameters: total anti-oxidative capacity of the ingluvies prior to infection and at 1, 2 and 7 d after infection; serum ALP activity and serum globin concentrations prior to infection and at 1 and 2 d after infection; T4 concentrations prior to infection; serum lysozyme activity at 1 d after infection; SOD and CAT activity in the ingluvies prior to infection and 7 d after infection; T3 concentrations at 1 and 2 d after infection; and the relative level of HSP70 mRNA expression in the ingluvies at 2 d after infection. However, treatment with 5.0 to 10.0 g/kg of Radix Isatidis increased the following parameters: ALT contents prior to infection and 1, 2 and 7 d after infection; serum cortisol concentrations and serum glucose at 1, 2 and 7 d after infection; MDA contents of the ingluvies at 1 and 2 d after infection; and T4 concentrations at 2 and 7 d after infection. Compared with the control group, significantly lower mortality was observed in the groups supplemented with 5.0 to 10.0 g/kg of Radix Isatidis. These results suggest that supplementation with 5.0 to 10.0 g/kg of Radix Isatidis in the basal diet could enhance resistance to P. mirabilis infection in P. manillensis. Statement of relevance: We believe that this manuscript is appropriate for publication in Aquaculture because it provides a natural method of controlling disease in P. manillensis, thereby avoiding the use of antibiotics and the development of antibiotic resistance.

Recent research suggests that temperature-induced tissue breakdown allows bacteria entry to the host, and nutritional supplementation can alleviate this breakdown. The aim of this study was to alleviate mortality of greenlip abalone, Haliotis laevigata, cultured at high summer water temperatures (25 degrees C) by dietary intervention using graded levels of peanut skin extract (PE; 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5%), green tea extract (GTE; 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5%) and vitamin C (1.0% vitamin C; 1.0% vitamin C + 1.0% GTE; and 1.0% vitamin C + 1.0% PE) in a commercial diet; these supplements contain antioxidant and bioactive compounds. The commercial diet containing 5.0% Australian grapeseed extract (GSE) fed at 25 degrees C was also included as a negative temperature/positive diet control due to improved survival and health of abalone at high temperatures in our previous study. Three-year-old abalone (49.21 g; 70.26 mm) were fed the commercial diet at 22 degrees C (positive temperature control), and the commercial diet (negative temperature control) and test diets at 25 degrees C for 38 days. Abalone survival was 85% for the commercial diet at 22 degrees C, whereas survival of abalone was significantly reduced to 40% when fed the commercial diet at 25 degrees C. There were no significant differences in survival of abalone fed the commercial diet at 22 degrees C and those fed 5.0% GSE, 0.5% GTE and 2.5% GTE diets at 25 degrees C. Supplements did not significantly affect oxygen consumption, ammonia excretion rates and total hemocyte count. Abalone fed 5.0% GTE had significantly lower phagocytic activity than those fed the commercial control diet at 22 degrees C. Supplementation with PE and vitamin C had no beneficial effects on survival, while GTE holds promise as a potential dietary additive to enhance the survival of abalone at higher water temperature. This study confirms that supplementation of 5.0% GSE in the commercial diet also improves the survival of greenlip abalone cultured at high summer water temperature in the laboratory setting. Statement of relevance: Purported to have diverse health benefits including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties, 5% Australian grape extract, graded levels of green tea extract, peanut skin extract and vitamin C were supplemented in a commercial abalone diet in order to improve survival of greenlip abalone at high water temperature.

"Lesoway, MP; Page, LR",Growth and differentiation during delayed metamorphosis of feeding gastropod larvae: signatures of ancestry and innovation,2008,MARINE BIOLOGY,153,4,723,734,,"Extent of larval growth among marine invertebrates has potentially profound implications for performance by benthic recruits because body size influences many biological processes. Among gastropods, feeding larvae often attain larger size at metamorphic competence than non-feeding larvae of basal gastropod clades. Delay of metamorphosis can further influence size at recruitment if larvae continue to grow during the delay. Some caenogastopod larvae grow during delayed metamorphosis, but opisthobranch larvae do not. Data on larval growth of neritimorph gastropods are needed to help determine which of these growth patterns for planktotrophic gastropod larvae is more derived. We cultured planktotrophic larvae from all three major gastropod clades with feeding larvae through delays of metamorphosis of 3-10 weeks. Larvae of the caenogastropod Euspira lewisii and the euthyneurans Haminoea vesicula (Opisthobranchia) and Siphonaria denticulata (Pulmonata) conformed to previously described growth patterns for their respective major clades. Furthermore, the caenogastropod continued to lengthen the prototroch (ciliary band for swimming and feeding) and to differentiate prospective post-metamorphic structures (gill filaments and radular teeth) during delayed metamorphosis. Larvae of the neritimorph Nerita atramentosa arrested shell growth during delayed metamorphosis but the radula continued to elongate, a pattern most similar to that of non-feeding larvae of Haliotis, a vetigastropod genus. Character mapping on a phylogenetic hypothesis suggests that large larval size and capacity for continued growth during delayed metamorphosis, as exhibited by some caenogastropods, is a derived innovation among feeding gastropod larvae. This novelty may have facilitated post-metamorphic evolution of predatory feeding using a long proboscis.",10.1007/s00227-007-0849-z,"Lesoway, Maryna/0000-0003-0218-3333",0025-3162,,,FEB,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-007-0849-z,

Recent research identified higher optimal dietary CP levels of greater than or equal to 35% for younger than 1-y-old abalone at higher water temperatures (20-22 degrees C). To validate the results of the laboratory-based research, the current trial was designed to investigate the effect of feeding two different commercially manufactured diets (standard-protein diet, 32% CP, versus a high-protein diet, 39% CP) to hybrid abalone (Haliotis laevigata x Haliotis rubra; initial weight: 3.10 g) on growth performance, feed utilization, and sales revenue under on-farm conditions. During this 18-mo trial, abalone were cultured using normal commercial practices over two summer periods at Great Southern Waters abalone farm (Indented Head, VIC, Australia). A significant improvement in specific growth rate (SGR) led to a 9% improvement in biomass gain for abalone fed with the high-protein diet. This improvement was achieved with no differences in survival, and minimal difference in feed input between diets. In addition, the feed conversion ratio of abalone fed with the high-protein feed was 7.1% superior to that of animals fed with the standard-protein diet. On the basis of a farm gate value of AUD35/kg abalone, for an additional feed input cost of AUD2/m(2) slab tank/y, a 9.5% increase in basic annual sales revenue (AUD44/m(2) slab tank/y) was achieved feeding the high-protein diet. In addition, due to an increased SGR by feeding the high-protein diet, the duration of a typical 3-y production cycle for hybrid abalone may be shortened by up to 3.4 mo. By adopting the high-protein diet, farmers may also harvest abalone sooner, and reduce exposure to one less summer. This may reduce heat-related mortalities and further improve productivity, and when combined with savings made with biomass and feed efficiency gains, a more than 10% improvement in productivity across the entire grow-out period for hybrid abalone may be achieved.",10.2983/035.035.0316,"Harris, James/0000-0002-0997-3015",0730-8000,1943-6319,,OCT,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.035.0316,

This study evaluated some parameters of the systemic antioxidant and immune responses in red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) exposed to 0.25 mL L- 1 eugenol (EUB), 3.0 mL L- 1 phenoxyethanol (PEB) and CO2 at saturation, as well as in a control (CT) without anesthetic. Abalone were anesthetized for 45 min and, during the recovery stage, hemolymph samples were collected at 0.5, 1, 2 and 24 h. Total protein content (TP), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, as well as nitric oxide (NO) production, were evaluated in hemolymph cell-free fraction (HCF) and hemocytes lysate (HL). In addition, total hemocyte count (THC) was determined. In HCF, TP was significantly higher in abalone exposed to PEB than in the other treatments and CT at 0.5, 1 and 24 h. SOD activity in HCF was significantly higher in all treatments compared to the CT (1 h), while CAT and MPO activity was only significantly higher in abalone exposed to EUB compared to PEB at 1, 2 and 24 h. In the HL fraction, the percentage of SOD inhibition was significantly higher only in abalone anesthetized with EUB compared to the CT (0.5 h). These results suggest that the antioxidant activity of the species during the recovery phase from anesthesia was transient and restored after 24 h. Similarly, the immune response of H. rufescens at the systemic level was not altered by the anesthetics, suggesting that the species adequately tolerated the anesthesia process.

An integrative approach consisted in monitoring the seasonal composition changes of these algae in terms of protein, lipid, soluble carbohydrate, fatty acid and amino-acid contents, and to relate it to seasonal growth and reproduction investment during a large-scale experiment. Abalone and algae were studied for one year in commercial sea-cage structures. Abalone fed with monospecific diet using either P. palmata or S. latissima, and with mixed diet presented the best growth rate, muscle ratio and gonad development. Seasonal daily weight gain was mainly associated with n-3/n-6 ratio, soluble carbohydrate content and total protein content. In term of aminoacid contents, the daily weight gain was associated with free phenylalanine as well as isoleucine levels. Moreover, 90% of 2-years old abalone started gonad development but less than a quarter featured a fully matured gonad. The gonad development of H. tuberculata was mostly associated to total valine, methionine, leucine, arginine and isoleucine levels. The age of initial sexual maturity in H. tuberculata turned to be a highly plastic trait in response to different growth rates and algal diets.

The gross energy content of the diets ranged from 4.26-3.68 kcal/g. Within a particular protein level, growth did not differ significantly. When dietary protein levels exceeded 32%, a trend of higher growth of abalone was observed for dietary treatments that contained lower levels of lipid (higher starch to lipid ratios). The amount of protein consumed daily for the 32%a dietary protein is apparently insufficient to meet requirements for energy and maximum growth. No notable diet-dependent differences in the proportional composition (dry weight) of the shell and the soft tissue, and the energy content of the soft tissue were observed. Daily food intake and consumed energy were significantly different among treatments, being inversely related to the calculated P:E ratios. The increased consumption may have been somewhat overestimated because of loss arising from lower water stability of the diets. Ammonia excretion ranged from 7.9-4.8 mu g NH(4)(+)/h /g abalone but was not significantly different among treatments except for the treatment containing 32% crude protein and a low carbohydrate: lipid ratio.

Diets were formulated to contain three levels of protein (24, 34 and 44%), each with three levels of fat (2, 6, and 10%), to produce diets with estimated protein energy (PE) ratios ranging from 14.5-32.0 mg/kJ. The rates of weight gain, nutritional indices and body composition of both the smaller (0.2-1.0 g) and larger (7.0-14.0 g) abalone were significantly affected by the levels of protein and energy in the diets. Moreover, the two size classes of abalone differed in their responses to the diets. Maximum growth was achieved at a higher dietary protein level in the larger abalone (44%) than the smaller abalone (34%). The protein content of the larger abalone soft tissue was higher (ca. 7%) than the smaller abalone. Irrespective of the lipid content, the percentage of protein deposited by the larger abalone was highest in those fed the 34 and 44% protein diets, whereas that of the smaller abalone was highest for the 24 and 34% protein diets. The condition factor (CF) of small abalone was significantly higher for those fed the 24% protein diets in comparison to those fed the 34 and 44% protein diets, whereas the reverse was found in the larger abalone. It was concluded that the larger abalone had a higher protein requirement than the smaller abalone. Diets containing the highest level of dietary fat (10%) produced significantly lower growth rates and efficiencies of protein deposition in comparison to abalone fed the diets containing 6 and 2% fat, however, these trends were more marked among the small abalone size class. In addition, the feed conversion ratio (FCR) of small abalone fed the 10% fat diets was consistently poorer, but this trend was not present among the larger abalone whose FCR improved with an increasing PE ratio. It was concluded that a dietary lipid level of 10% is too high for H. midae to maintain a maximal growth rate. Proximal analysis of abalone fed the experimental diets revealed that the PE ratio of the diet as well as abalone size significantly affected the carcass composition.

Biofilm confers to bacteria more resistance to physical and chemical agents as well as to different mechanisms of the innate immune system. The aim of this work was to evaluate the ability of in vitro biofilm production in 32 S. uberis isolates from bovine mastitis and identified by biochemical tests and subsequently confirmed by the amplification of the pauA gene. The isolates were cultivated in TMP broth and TMP broth with the addition of 0.5% glucose, 1% sucrose, 1% lactose or 0.5% skim milk in microtiter plates stained with crystal violet. We demonstrated that S. uberis isolated from bovine mastitis are able to produce biofilms in TMP broth and, also that biofilm formation by S. uberis can be significantly enhanced by the addition of 0.5% glucose or 1% sucrose to TMP broth. This may suggest that the carbohydrates in milk or within the ruminant gut might affect the growth mode of S. uberis. In addition, our results showed that in vitro biofilm production under different conditions of supplementation displays variation among the isolates and that each isolate shows a particular profile of biofilm production. This phenotypic heterogeneity in biofilm production exhibited by S. uberis could at least partly explain why this bacterium has the ability to adapt to different niches facilitating survival to diverse and stressful conditions.

In the current study, a member of the MACPF domain-containing proteins, macrophage expressed gene-1 (MPEG1) encoding 730 amino acids with the theoretical molecular mass of 79.6 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.49 was characterized from disk abalone Haliotis discus discus (AbMPEG1). We found that the characteristic MACPF domain (val(131)-Tyr(348)) and transmembrane segment (Ala(669)-Ile(691)) of AbMPEG1 are located in the N- and C-terminal ends of the protein, respectively. Ortholog comparison revealed that AbMPEG1 has the highest sequence identity with its pink abalone counterpart, while sequences identities of greater than 90% were observed with MPEG1 members from other abalone species. Likewise, the furin cleavage site KRRRK was highly conserved in all abalone species, but not in other species investigated. We identified an intron-less genomic sequence within disk abalone AbMPEG1, which was similar to other mammalian, avian, and reptilian counterparts. Transcription factor binding sites, which are important for immune responses, were identified in the 5'-flanking region of AbMPEG1. qPCR revealed AbMPEG1 transcripts are present in every tissues examined, with the highest expression level occurring in mantle tissue. Significant up-regulation of AbMPEG1 transcript levels was observed in hemocytes and gill tissues following challenges with pathogens (Vibrio parahemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus) as well as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs: lipopolysaccharides and poly I:C immunostimulant). Finally, the antibacterial activity of the MACPF domain was characterized against Gram-negative and -positive bacteria using a recombinant peptide. Taken together, these results indicate that the biological significance of the AbMPEG1 gene includes a role in protecting disk abalone through the ability of AbMPEG1 to initiate an innate immune response upon pathogen invasion.

The immune and inflammatory responses of invertebrate clade B SERPINs have not been widely reported. In the present study, three proteins with high similarity to clade B SERPINs, referred to as AbSERPIN-1, AbSERPIN-2 and AbSERPIN-3, were identified from disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus). While AbSERPIN-1 (399 aa) was of a typical size for this protein class, AbSERPIN-2 (506 aa) and AbSERPIN-3 (532 aa) were relatively larger. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the characteristic SERPIN domain in each AbSERPIN. In addition, the N-terminal region of both AbSERPIN-2 and AbSERPIN-3 contained a predicted low complexity region (LCR) and a signal peptide, suggesting that these proteins are secretory proteins and are, thus, novel peptides. Tertiary structural models of the AbSERPINs highlighted their structural and functional conservation. Ubiquitous expression of AbSERPIN transcripts was evaluated by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) analysis in seven tissue types. AbSERPIN-1, AbSERPIN-2, and AbSERPIN-3 transcript levels were highest in mantle, hemocytes, and muscles, respectively. Temporal expression analysis revealed that AbSERPINs were significantly (P < 0.05) elevated in hemocytes during the early/middle stages following the injection of a bacterial pathogen (Vibrio parahaemolyticus or Listeria monocytogenes) or an immuno-stimulant (lipopolysaccharide). Moreover, mantle tissue injury led to significant changes in the temporal expression of AbSERPIN mRNA. Specifically, transcription of AbSERPIN-1 and AbSERPIN-3 was considerably up-regulated, while expression of AbSERPIN-2 was suppressed. These results suggest a potential role of AbSERPINs in response to pathogen invasion and tissue injury in disk abalone. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Results showed that the daily increment in shell length (DISL) of abalone in the treatment with 1 x 10(3) IU vitamin A per kilogram diet was significantly higher than that with 0 or 1 x 10(6) IU vitamin A per kilogram supplementation (P < 0.05). Vitamin A deficiency (0 IU/kg) significantly elevated the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reductase (GR) in the viscera of abalone (P < 0.05). In muscle, the effects of vitamin A deficiency on SOD and GPX activities were the same as those in viscera, however, the activity of GR significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Vitamin A deficiency significantly decreased the ratio of CAT to SOD (catalase/superoxide dismutase) in viscera (P < 0.05). Nevertheless, it significantly decreased the ratio of GR to GPX in muscle (P < 0.05).

With a 3 x 2 factorial design, three levels of dietary lipid (1.59 %, 3.95 % and 6.83 %, respectively) and two water temperatures (17 degrees C and 23 degrees C) were set. After a 100-day feeding trial, results showed that compared with 6.83 % and 1.59 %, 3.95 % of dietary lipid significantly increased the weight gain ratio (WGR) and daily increment in shell length (DISL) of abalone. Compared with 17 degrees C, 23 degrees C of water temperature increased WGR of abalone. Both of dietary lipid level and water temperature play main effects on WGR and a significant interaction was observed. Dietary lipid level plays a main effect on DISL. 3.95 % of dietary lipid level significantly increased trypsin activities in intestine under two water temperatures. Compared with 17 degrees C, 23 degrees C of water temperature significantly increased the activities of trypsin and Na+-K+-ATPase in intestine of abalone in 1.59 % of dietary lipid level. Dietary lipid level plays a main effect on trypsin activity. Water temperature plays a main effect on activities of trypsin, amylase and Na+-K+-ATPase. The 6.83 % of dietary lipid level decreased survival and cumulative mortality after Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection. Compared with 17 degrees C, 23 degrees C of water temperature significantly decreased survival and increased cumulative mortality, where both dietary lipid level and water temperature play a main effect. 6.83 % of dietary lipid level significantly decreased respiratory burst activity, blood cell count and acid phosphatase activity. Compared with 23 degrees C, 17 degrees C of water temperature significantly increased respiratory burst activity, blood cell count, activities of lysozyme and acid phosphatase. Dietary lipid level significantly affected respiratory burst activity, blood cell count and acid phosphatase activity. Water temperature significantly affected respiratory burst activity, blood cell count and activities of lysozyme and acid phosphatase, and a significant interaction between dietary lipid level and water temperature on respiratory burst activity and blood cell count was observed. The 6.83 % dietary lipid level up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines expression which was associated with Perilipin2/TLR-s/MyD88/IRAK4/(NF-kappa B or AP-1) signaling, down-regulated relative gene expression of anti-oxidative enzymes which was related to Keap1/Nrf-2 signaling, up-regulated caspase-3 and caspase-7 expression which was related to JNK/(Bcl2 and Bax) signaling, down-regulated ATG101, Beclin-1 and LC3 expression and decreased LONP, HSP70 and HSP90 expression which was related to HSF-1/Sirt3 signaling. Compared with 17 degrees C, 23 degrees C of water temperature up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines expression which was related to activating Perilipin2/(NF-kappa B or AP-1) signaling, down-regulated mRNA levels of antioxidative enzymes which was related to inhibiting Keap1/Nrf-2 signaling, up-regulated caspase-3 expression which was related to Bcl2/Bax signaling, down-regulated ATG101, Beclin-1 and LC3 expression, down-regulated expression of LONP, HSP70 and HSP90 which was related to inhibiting HSF-1/Sirt signaling. Taken together, 3.95 % of dietary lipid level at 23 degrees C of water temperature increased growth performance and decreased immune function of abalone, while 3.95 % of dietary lipid level at 17 degrees C showed the opposite trend.

A modified metabolite extraction protocol using deuterated solvents was developed for H-1-NMR-based metabolite profiling of digestive gland in response to the short-term feeding/starvation experiment, to avoid lyophilisation prior to biochemical analysis. PLS-DA revealed that fed and starved abalone are metabolically distinct from each other after 28 and 56 days. After 28 days, the fed group was defined by an increase in arginine, glucose, glutamate, glycine, inosine and uracil (P < 0.05), and the starved group was defined by an increase in N,N-dimethylglycine. After 56 days, the fed group still displayed increased glucose (P < 0.05), while N,N-dimethylglycine remained elevated in the starved group (P < 0.05). Arginine and glycogen were all higher at 28 days compared to 56 days, suggesting decreased anaerobic energy production at the later time point. Only glucose and N,N-dimethylglycine were significantly different between the fed and starved groups after 56 days, suggesting that abalone had not acclimatised to the starvation treatment after 28 days.

The cDNA sequences of AbC1qDC1, AbC1qDC2, and AbC1qD0 consisted of 807, 1305, and 660 bp open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 269, 435, and 220 amino acids (aa), respectively. Putative signal peptides and the N-terminal gC1q domain were identified in all three AbC1qDC proteins. An additional predicted motif region, known as the coiled coil region (CCR), was identified next to the signal sequence of AbC1qDC2. The genomic organization of the AbC1qDCs was determined using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library. It was found that the CDS of AbC1qDC1 was distributed among three exons, while the CDSs of AbC1qDC2 and AbC1qDC3 were distributed between two exons. Sequence analysis indicated that the AbC1qDC proteins shared <40% identity with other counterparts from different species. According to the neighbor joining phylogenetic tree, the proteins were grouped within an invertebrate group with high evolutionary distances, which suggests that they are new members of the C1qDC family. Higher expression of AbC1qDC1 and AbC1qDC2 was detected in hepatopancreas, muscle, and mantle tissues compare to the other tissues analyzed, using reverse transcription, followed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) using SYBR Green, whereas AbC1qDC3 was predominantly expressed in gill tissues, followed by muscles and the hepatopancreas. The temporal expression of AbC1qDC transcripts in gills after bacterial (Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes) and lipopolysaccharide stimulation indicated that AbC1qDCs can be strongly induced by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species with different response profiles. The results of this study suggest that AbC1qDCs are involved in immune responses against invading bacterial pathogens.

In a 12-week study, the effects of age, water temperature and dietary protein levels on digestive enzyme activity in greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) were investigated. One-and 2-year old abalone were fed diets with crude protein (CP) levels from 24 to 36% (18.0-28.6% digestible protein) and cultured at 14, 18 and 22 degrees C. Diets were formulated to be isoenergetic (12.5 MJ kg(-1) digestible energy) and isolipidic (3.6% crude lipid). Trypsin, alpha-amylase and lipase activities were measured, and were influenced differently by abalone age, water temperature and dietary protein levels. Lipase and alpha-amylase activities significantly increased as water temperatures were raised. In contrast, trypsin activity was not affected by water temperature. Trypsin activity of 2-year old abalone was significantly lower (53%) than that of 1-year old abalone. The alpha-amylase activities of 1-year old abalone were significantly up-regulated as dietary protein levels increased. In contrast, 2-year old abalone down-regulated alpha-amylase activity by 55% when fed 33% CP, compared to abalone fed 30% CP. The significant trypsin activity down-regulation in 2-year old abalone compared to 1-year old animals provides further support to reducing dietary protein for 2-year old abalone to optimise cultured greenlip abalone production. Significantly higher alpha-amylase activity in 1-year old abalone as starch levels were reduced indicates a compensatory effect in abalone fed carbohydrate deficient diets. Further research is recommended to optimise the protein to energy ratio for different age classes of greenlip abalone, especially when fed high dietary protein levels.

However, due to a paucity of genetic information, such as transcriptome resources, our un-derstanding of their stress adaptation is restricted. In this research, using single-molecule long-read (SMRT) sequencing technology, a library composed of ten tissues (i.e., haemocytes, gills, muscle, hepatopancreas, digestive tract, mantle, mucous gland, ovary, testis and head) was constructed and sequenced. In all, 41,855 high-quality unique transcripts, among which 24,778 were successfully annotated. Additionally, 13,463 SSRs, 1,169 transcription factors, and 18,124 lncRNAs were identified in H. discus hannai transcriptome. Furthermore, multiple immune-related transcripts were identified according to KEGG annotation, and a portion of these transcripts were mapped into several classical immune-related pathways, including the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Additionally, 24 typical sequences related to the immunity pathway were detected by RT-PCR; the results showed that most of the immune-related genes showed signifi-cantly high expression at 72 h after bacterial challenges and thermal stress, especially the expression level of genes in gills was significantly higher than that in haemocytes under V. parahaemolyticus stress at 24 h.

Gonad growth and total food consumption were significantly higher in the control group (normoxia) compared with the hypoxic groups at the end of the experiment. Weekly feed intake and total feed consumption were significantly reduced in the two hypoxic groups.

However, knowledge regarding invertebrate galectins is still in its infancy. With the intention of filling the knowledge gap, here we identified a quadruple domain-containing galectin from marine invertebrate disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus (AbGalec), and characterized it. AbGalec consisted of four distinct carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) and lacked a signal peptide. Expression analysis revealed AbGalec to be ubiquitously expressed in all the examined early embryonic stages of abalone, with highest expression in the 16-cell stage, suggesting the importance of AbGalec in early developmental processes. Tissue distribution analysis revealed the highest expression of AbGalec in abalone mantle, followed by that in gills and hemocytes. Immune challenge experiments revealed significant upregulation of AbGalec at 24 h and 48 h post injection (p.i.) with bacterial and viral components. These results suggested the possible involvement of AbGalec in host defense mechanisms. Polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) injections were capable of inducing AbGalec transcript expression more prominently than bacterial stimulants, thus providing evidence for its role in viral infections. We determined the virus-neutralizing ability of a quadruple domain-containing galectin for the first time, by analyzing the downregulation of VHSV transcripts during the overexpression of AbGalec. Significant downregulation of VHSV transcripts was observed after 24 h and 48 h of post infection.

A comparison of prey consumed with the relative abundance of prey groups shows that the wrasse takes prey more or less in proportion to its abundance, with variation in this pattern attributed to prey defences and predator choice. A long-term study showed that per capita consumption of cryptic abalone increased with increasing abalone density, suggesting a functional response of wrasse to the density of a preferred prey. The wrasse is a diurnal predator with a defined home range that increases with increasing size of wrasse.

To enhance the viability of cultivating H. kamtschatkana for commercial and restoration purposes, more information is needed on the optimal macroalgal diet that maximizes abalone growth and nutrition. This study compares the suitability of two commonly cultivated species of macroalgae as feed: Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp), a kelp with relatively low protein content, and Devaleraea mollis (Pacific dulse), a rhodophyte with comparatively high protein content. Fifty H. kamtschatkana specimens, with a mean shell length of 45.25 +/- 4.26 mm, were collected from the wild and fed either S. latissima, D. mollis, or an alternating diet of the two for 28 wk. Feed consumption was measured weekly, whereas shell length and weight change were recorded every 2 mo. Despite consuming significantly more S. latissima than D. mollis (P < 0.001, H. kamtschatkana showed no significant difference in specific growth rate (SGR) (P = 0.775) or linear growth rate (LGR) (P = 0.746) among the diets. Feed conversion efficiency (FCE) was significantly higher for D. mollis than S. latissima (P < 0.001), although there was no significant difference in protein efficiency ratio (PER) (P = 0.129). Proximate composition analyses of abalone tissue showed no significant difference in protein, lipid, carbohydrate, or caloric content across macroalgae diets.

BLAST analysis revealed that HdhHSP90 shared high similarity with other known HSP90s, and the five conserved amino acid blocks defined as HSP90 protein family signatures were also identified in HdhHSP90, which indicated that HdhHSP90 should be a cytosolic member of the HSP90 family.

The results showed that the expression levels of HdhHSP90 transcript were significantly up-regulated and reached the maximum (0.47-fold) in hepatopancreas of Pacific abalone fed with optimal dietary Se (1.32 mg Kg(-1)) (p < 0.05). However, these levels significantly decreased in hepatopancreas at the excessive dietary Se (48.70 mg Kg(-1)) (p < 0.01).

Results demonstrate the importance and effect of light intensity on the growth of diatom species and the growth, survival and behaviour of juvenile H. laevigata. Results also show that light intensity for diatom culture and husbandry of juveniles in a hatchery needs to be considered carefully. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The meat quality of abalone is affected by diet and temperature, and this in turn directly influences consumer acceptance of abalone products and financial returns to producers. The aim of this study was to investigate the impacts of diet (Gracilaria lemaneiformis vs artificial feed) and water temperature (low, 19 degrees C and high, 27 degrees C) on growth performance, nutritional value, flavor, and sensory quality of abalone. The results showed that artificial feed led to increases in growth, content of body protein, total free amino acids (TAA), delicious amino acids (DAA), volatile compounds (alcohols, acids, aromatic compounds, and esters), and sensory quality (hardness) of abalone meat. High temperature significantly decreased the growth, body moisture, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and hardness but increased the contents of DAA, TAA, alcohols, acids, and ar-omatic compounds in abalone meat. Our study suggests that high temperature significantly decreases the growth and nutritional value of abalone muscle but does provide a different mouthfeel and flavor for consumers, and nutrition-balanced artificial feed as the diet at a low water temperature maximizes the growth of abalone without sacrificing meat quality. The results may help to formulate an optimal feed strategy for farming industries throughout the abalone culture period, thereby allowing farmers to harvest premium quality abalone and elevate the market value of abalone products.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739241,"Ma, Yao-Bin/0000-0003-3344-4719",0044-8486,1873-5622,,Mar-30,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739241,

The thermal resistance of purebreds, hybrid F-1 and backcross populations were evaluated through Arrhenius break temperature (ABT) of cardiac performance in this study. The results showed that the hybrid F-1 had the best thermal resistance, and the ABT gradually decreased with the increase in recurring number.

These diets were the red alga Palmaria palmata, which had been grown in seawater enriched with two levels of ammonia-N and contained a protein content of either 41% (High-N) or 3 2% (Low-N) and the brown alga Laminaria saccharina (23% protein). A significantly different response to the macroalgal diets by the two sea urchin species was found in terms of food consumption rate, food conversion efficiency, gonadal growth and gonad nutritional composition. P miliaris was able to efficiently utilise the High-N P palmata, whereas P lividus exhibited a higher food conversion efficiency (FCE) and specific growth rate (SGR) when fed the Low-N compared with the High-N P palmata. P miliaris had a significantly higher food consumption rate and higher gonad index (GI) compared with P lividus, irrespective of diet type. The lowest FCE, SGR and GI were shown by both species fed L. saccharina. No interspecific difference in gonadal nitrogen content was observed, although a positive relationship was shown between dietary and gonadal nitrogen content for both species. All three macroalgal diets produced bright orange or yellow orange gonad colour in P lividus. High-N and Low-N P. palmata improved gonad colouration in P miliaris compared with L. saccharina. The results suggest that P. miliaris can efficiently assimilate high protein plant-based diet, whereas P. lividus is less capable of benefiting from high dietary protein levels and this should be taken into consideration when culturing this species either in land-based or sea-based polyculture systems.

Summer mortality likely involves complex interactions between biological, environmental, husbandry and nutritional factors; however, this is poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a case-control study for farmed greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) and hybrid abalone (H. laevigata x Haliotis rubra) to identify risk factors associated with summer mortality. Farm mortality data from 2015 to 2021 were used to identify tanks which fit the case definition and tanks that did not. We constructed a model to predict summer mortality risk using logistic regression and forward variable selection. Modelling considered 61 potential risk factors (examples included water quality, husbandry, climate, biology). The final selected model including six main effects and five two-way interactions. Except for maximum water temperature in the week prior to the case/control date, all parameters selected in the final model were involved in one or more interactions. The model identified interactions between age and each of previous year summer mortality, size when removed from weaning tanks and feed rate. There were also interactive effects of previous year summer mortality and size when removed from weaning tanks, and of feed rate and post-grading mortality. The risk of summer mortality was two times more likely for every 2 & DEG;C increase in maximum weekly water temperature. Post-grading mortality was associated with an increased risk of summer mortality, but relative risk decreased at higher feed rates. Risk of summer mortality in younger abalone increased with higher feed rates, while increasing feed rates for 30-month abalone had no effect on the risk of summer mortality. Abalone in tanks which experienced summer mortality the previous year were at a higher risk of summer mortality regardless of age. For abalone that did not experience summer mortality the year prior, the subsequent risk of summer mortality increased with abalone age.

To examine the circadian expression pattern of orexin receptor type 2 (OX2R) and its potential effect on the feeding behavior of abalone, the coding region sequence of OX2R that is 1215 bp in length and encodes 404 amino acids was first cloned using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique. A recombinant expression vector was constructed for H. discus hannai based on the OX2R protein, obtaining a recombinant protein with a molecular weight of 46 kDa. Polyclonal antibody was prepared with the purified recombinant protein used as the antigen, and the antibody titer of >= 512 K was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression levels of OX2R determined using western blotting were highest in the intestinal tract (P < 0.05), but they were not significantly different from the levels in the pedal. Immunofluorescence experiments affirmed that OX2R was widely expressed in the columnar cells of the intestinal mucosal epithelium. To further account for the relationship between the onset of feeding behavior and the expression level of OX2R in abalone, the circadian expression characteristics of OX2R were analyzed by dissecting the intestinal tissues after three days of normal feeding and fasting and following the refeeding treatment. The expression levels of OX2R in the refeeding group were significantly higher than those in the normal feeding and fasting groups at any time point (P < 0.05). The cosine curve analysis revealed that the expression levels of OX2R lost rhythmicity after fasting. Based on the quantification of behavioral data for abalone after fasting and refeeding, the cumulative movement distance and movement duration in each group followed a significant cosine rhythm (P < 0.05), which is consistent with abalone's nocturnal ecological habits. However, the cumulative movement distance and movement duration in the fasting group were significantly lower than those in the normal feeding and refeeding groups (P < 0.05). The peak phases of the cumulative movement distance and movement duration in the refeeding group (ZT08:22 and ZT08:44) shifted backward compared to the normal feeding group (ZT07:33 and ZT07:39). The above results first identified the structural characteristics and circadian expression patterns of OX2R in the marine mollusk abalone, which may reveal the molecular mechanism behind the generation of a feeding rhythm in marine nocturnal organisms and serve as a tool helping to maintain the diversity of marine benthic resources.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.12.313,,0141-8130,1879-0003,,Feb-28,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.12.313,36587646

In some invertebrates, heat shock proteins (HSPs) are immune effectors and have been described as potent activators of the innate immune response. Several diseases have become a threat to abalone farming worldwide; therefore, increasing disease resistance is considered to be a long-term goal for breeding programs. A trait will respond to selection only if it is determined partially by additive genetic variation. The aim of this study was to estimate the heritability (h(2)) and the additive genetic coefficient of variation (CVA) of HSP70 as a component of innate immunity of the abalone Haliotis rufescens, in order to assess its potential response to selection. These genetic components were estimated for the variations in the intracellular (in haemocytes) and extracellular (serum) protein levels of HSP70 in response to an immunostimulant agent in 60 full-sib families of H. rufescens. Levels of HSP70 were measured twice in the same individuals, first when they were young and again when they were pre-harvest adults, to estimate the repeatability (R), the h(2) and the potential response to selection of these traits at these life stages. High HSP70 levels were observed in abalones subjected to immunostimulation in both the intracellular and extracellular haemolymph fractions. This is the first time that changes in serum levels of HSP70 have been reported in response to an immune challenge in molluscs. HSP70 levels in both fractions and at both ages showed low h(2) and R, with values that were not significantly different from zero. However, HSP70 induced levels had a CVA of 13.3-16.2% in young adults and of 2.7-8.1% in pre-harvest adults. Thus, despite its low h(2), HSP70 synthesis in response to an immune challenge in red abalone has the potential to evolve through selection because of its large phenotypic variation and the presence of additive genetic variance, especially in young animals.",10.1371/journal.pone.0141959,"Farias, William/0000-0002-6360-2231; Brokordt, Katherina/0000-0003-3773-2064",1932-6203,,,Nov-03,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0141959,26529324

Abalone artificial diets generally include fishmeal, limiting their utilization in ecologically sustainable aquaculture and affecting abalone quality and acceptance by the consumers. A six month feeding trial was conducted to assess the nutritional value of four different dried seaweed meals: Ulva lactuca (Chlorophyta), Gracilaria cornea (Rhodophyta), Laminaria digitata (Phaeophyta) and Palmaria palmata (Rhodophyta), as ingredients to all-vegetable-based formulated feeds for abalone Haliotis tuberculata coccinea (33.1 +/- 0.8 mm and 4.7 +/- 0.6 g). A mixed fresh algae diet of G. cornea and U. Ulva rigida, reared in an Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) system, served as control. Survival rates were very high (95-98%), regardless of the diet fed. Enriched fresh algae produced a significantly higher growth for H. tuberculata coccinea (169% weight gain) than all the artificial diets (49-84% WG). Comparison among abalone fed the different formulated diets showed that the inclusion of P. palmata improved growth, condition index and dietary protein utilization. On the contrary, the use of L. digitata markedly reduced the efficiency of dietary protein since the protein-related nutritional index (PER), the percentage of protein deposited in the foot muscle as well as the meat to shell ratio recorded for animals fed this diet were the lowest, despite a higher feed intake. Large differences were found in the FA profile of fresh algae as compared with the three formulated diets. The n-3/n-6 ratio was much higher in the fresh algae and, consequently, in the foot tissues of abalone fed this diet in comparison to the one of those fed the formulated ones. The elevated contents of 20:4n-6 in the abalone fed the experimental diets and 20:5n-3 in abalone fed the fresh algae, as well as their respective metabolites, suggest that abalone have the ability to desaturate and elongate LA to ARA and ALA to EPA.

In the current study, two selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidases (AbSeGPxs) that shared 54.3% identity were identified from the disk abalone Haliotis discus discus. The open reading frames (ORFs) of AbSeGPx-a and AbSeGPx-b coded for 222 and 220 amino acids, respectively, with a characteristic selenocysteine residue encoded by an opal stop codon (TGA). The conserved selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element was predicted in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of both isoforms, and they were found to form two stem-loop structures. Amino acid comparison and phylogenetic studies revealed that the AbSeGPxs were closely related to those in other mollusk species and were evolutionarily distinct from those of other taxonomic groups. The SYBR Green qPCR was employed in investigating the transcripts of AbSeGPxs. The expression of AbSeGPxs mRNA was examined in different embryonic developmental stages and differential expression patterns for AbSeGPx-a and AbSeGPx-b were noted. Meanwhile, the highest expression of AbSeGPxs was detected in the hepatopancreas of healthy adult animals. Next, transcriptional levels were profiled in hemocytes of adults to determine the immune responses of AbSeGPxs to microbial infections. The results revealed the significant up-regulation of AbSeGPx-a in a time-dependent manner after bacterial (Listeria monocytogenes and Vibrio parahaemolyticus) and viral (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus) infections.

Analysis of the borehole positions on shells of H. rubra showed that they were significantly concentrated in the area where the abalone muscle is attached. This is in sharp contrast to other drilling predators of molluscs. The whelks did not change their choice of drilling site in response to experimental removal of the shell surface, or to changes in shell thickness. They may use shell ridges and possibly the morphology of the abalone shell to determine where to drill, The behaviour of the prey appears unlikely to affect the drilling position, and shell repair by the abalone is too slow to act as an effective defence in any area. The area over the muscle is the thickest part of the shell covering abalone tissue, and requires a much longer time to penetrate, as drilling is slow. The cost of drilling through the thicker part of the shell is presumably outweighed by the benefits gained from feeding on the muscle tissue.

Commercial abalone nurseries typically settle larvae onto vertical plastic plates coated with algae that act as a settlement cue and an important post-settlement food source. It becomes increasingly difficult to maintain an adequate algal food supply as the abalones grow and for this purpose many nurseries use the alga, Ulvella lens, as it is a very effective settlement cue as well as offering a resilient food source for the developing abalones. However, juvenile abalones can deplete a film of diatoms on the plates before they are capable of ingesting U. lens, and once abalone reach similar to 5 mm SL the high grazing pressure may exceed even what U. lens can support, requiring nurseries to provide additional cultured algae or prematurely wean the juveniles onto manufactured diets. Three prospective microfilamentous algal species isolated from the tanks of a commercial abalone facility, were selected as potentially suitable nursery algae as they demonstrated resistance to intensive juvenile grazing pressure, displayed rapid vegetative growth, and could be triggered to mass sporulate as a means of rapidly coating nursery tanks. The current study involved two experiments and assessed the suitability of each species as a live algal feed for juvenile abalones compared to U. lens. These experiments measured: (1) ingestibility and grazing resistance of each alga against juvenile abalone 1-8 mm SL, and (2) the ability of each species to recover once grazers had been removed. Two algae (Ulvophyceae sp. 1 and 3) demonstrated the desirable properties of being easily grazed by abalones of a smaller size (average SL 2.33 mm and 2.20 mm respectively) than U. lens (2.89 mm) yet provide an algal film that is likely to be resilient and durable under grazing pressure. These algae also displayed significantly greater rates of recovery following grazing than U. lens (p<0.01), an important attribute for restoring algal films in nursery systems between grazing events or between batches of juvenile abalones. The results of this study indicate that these novel algae have a combination of desirable characteristics for use in commercial abalone nurseries. Further experiments in commercial scale nursery systems should be pursued to assess the food value and performance of these species as a feed for juvenile abalones. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This study examined the effect of three probiotic candidates (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens MA228, Enterobacter ludwigii MA208, and Pediococcus acidilactici MA160) on the growth and survival rates of juvenile abalone, Haliotis asinina L). The three probionts were incorporated as a mixture of two or three onto Gracilaria sp. and fed to juvenile abalone for 62 days. Then, specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and survival rate (SR) were measured. The results showed that the increments in weight and length were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the abalone that received a mixture of probionts. While feed conversion ratio (FCR) was significantly lower than the control. The supplementation of B. amyloliquefaciens MA228 and E. ludwigii MA208 (2P) in the Gracilaria sp. resulted in an increase of 9% SGR in terms of weight and decreased FCR value 0.2 unit, compared with the control. However, there was no difference in the survival rates between the mix of 2 and 3 probionts, > 72% among the treatments and control.

The high water temperature in the middle of the summer season frequently limits the aquaculture productivity of abalone. To cope with the problem, this study aimed to investigate viability, attachment rate, changes of immune response, and physiological properties of juvenile small abalone Haliotis diversicolor aquatilis against high water temperature stress under (CO)-C-60-gamma irradiation-mediated hormetic effects. To examine physiological changes of abalone, the gamma-ray irradiated and non-irradiated groups were distinguished by grouping a total of 70 abalones in a treated group and a control group (each group included twenty-five female and ten male abalones). The treated group was exposed to (CO)-C-60-gamma irradiation using a designed experimental apparatus, the control group was not. Our results revealed that the low level of gamma ray (20 Gy)-irradiated Haliotis diversicolor aquatilis showed a 100% survival rate during the experiment. After gamma ray exposure, all the abalones were cultured without feeding and bioactivities were measured to examine gamma ray-induced physiological responses. The results suggested the potential for selective breeding using gamma ray irradiation hormesis to manipulate the number of eggs, fertilization rate, hatching rate, and attachment rate. The shell length of juvenile abalone was significantly enhanced by a 20 Gy radiation dose. We could presume that the effect of hormesis in the gamma-ray irradiation parent shellfish also had a genetic effect on the offspring. In order to verify changes in immune response and stress tolerance of abalone under high temperature stress, lysozyme activity and survival rates were compared at a water temperature of 30 degrees C. Interestingly, the Co-60 gamma ray-irradiated abalones exhibited almost a 1.65-fold enhanced survival rate along with reduced lysozyme activity after 12 h of high temperature stress. Our results speculate that low levels of Co-60 gamma ray-mediated hormetic effects can be an effective strategy for shell length growth and high temperature stress tolerance.",10.3390/jmse8110906,,,2077-1312,,NOV,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jmse8110906,

Growth and fatty acid composition of the muscle tissue were compared to that of abalone fed a reference diet that contained no added lipids (0.25% total lipids). After 75 days of culture in a flow-through system, no significant differences in growth were found among abalone fed the different oil types. Responses to different dietary levels of lipid were significantly different but not to sources of oils. Maximum growth was achieved at a 1.5% inclusion of oil sources. It appears that abalone have a great capacity to synthesize lipid from carbohydrate sources. Results also suggest that abalone are capable of desaturation and elongation of 18 C polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of the n - 3 and n - 6 family to 20:5n - 3 and 20:4n - 6. Synthesis of 22:6n - 3 from 20:5n - 3 is not reflected in the results. The lack of a growth response to the different levels of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) provided by the different oils included in the experimental diets may be due to an insufficient duration of the experiment to achieve an essential fatty acid deficiency. The relationship between fatty acid profiles of tissue and the diets fed to the abalone suggests that metabolic activity of the gut microflora is not a source of essential fatty acids.

In the current study juvenile H. midae were exposed for one month to two constant temperatures (14 degrees C and 19 degrees C), with three oxygen levels (82%, 98% and 126% oxygen saturation) at each temperature. One additional treatment was included at 19 degrees C, 126% oxygen, where feed was supplemented with L-proline. The results presented here suggest that long-term 19 degrees C exposure is more stressful to H. midae juveniles than a 14 degrees C exposure of the same duration, since exposure to higher temperature generally resulted in higher activities of the antioxidant enzymes measured but lower total antioxidant capacities. Haemolymph glucose levels responded to oxygen treatment at the 14 degrees C exposure, but the same response was not initiated in the 19 degrees C treatment, possibly because the animals exposed to the 19 degrees C treatment relied on proteins to a larger extent. Increased oxygen levels at the 19 degrees C treatment did not cause more DNA damage or protein carbonylation compared to lower oxygen levels. Supplementing feed with L-proline at the high temperature/high oxygen treatment caused a decrease in haemolymph haemocyanin (which may exhibit catalase function) content and a slight decrease in some of the antioxidant enzyme activities, while maintaining the same total antioxidant capacity compared with the same treatment where feed was not supplemented. The overall DNA integrity profile also changed with proline-supplementation, as did the induction level of hsp70. When projecting tissue growth over a 12 month period under these conditions, we estimate that H. midae juveniles in this study may exhibit a significant increase in mass when their feed was supplemented with L-proline, indicating that L-proline supplementation provides some benefit to the individual. It might therefore warrant conducting long-term growth trials on land-based mariculture facilities to further investigate its potential benefit to the mariculture industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A brown epiphyte, Myrionema strangulans, causes a disease of the Ulva, which is currently managed by farmers by restocking. The main potential threat is that some farmers are wary of integrated systems, fearing they may promote disease in abalone, although Ulva has been grown in abalone effluent and fed back to the abalone on one farm for 6 years without adverse effects. Opportunities exist for the expansion of Ulva cultivation via further spread of the abalone industry, the inclusion of seaweed raceways in proposed fish-farming activities, or the potential for the inclusion of high quality cultivated Ulva as a constituent in aquafeed.

In this study, we characterized two ferritin homologues in the red abalone Haliotis rufescens, a species of economic importance for Chile, USA and Mexico. Two ferritin subunits (Hrfer1 and Hrfer2) were cloned. Hrfer1 cDNA is an 807 bp clone containing a 516 bp open reading frame (ORF) that corresponds to a novel ferritin subunit in H. rufescens. Hrfer2 cDNA is an 868 bp clone containing a 516 bp ORF that corresponds to a previously reported ferritin subunit, but in this study 5'- and 3'-UTR sequences were additionally found. We detected a putative Iron Responsive Element (IRE) in the 5'-UTR sequence, suggesting a posttranscriptional regulation of Hrfer2 translation by iron. The deduced protein sequences of both cDNAs possessed the motifs and domains required in functional ferritin subunits. Expression patterns of both ferritins in different tissues, during different developmental stages, and in response to bacterial (Vibrio splendidus) exposure were examined. Both Hrfer1 and Hrfer2 are most expressed in digestive gland and gonad. Hrfer1 mRNA levels increased about 34-fold along with larval developmental process, attaining the highest level in the creeping post-larvae. Exogenous feeding is initiated at the creeping larva stage; thus, the increase of Hrfer1 may suggest and immunity-related role upon exposure to bacteria. Highest Hrfer2 expression levels were detected at trochophore stage; which may be related with early shell formation. Upon challenge with, the bacteria an early mild induction of Hrfer2 (2 h post-challenge), followed by a stronger induction of Hrfer1 at 15 h post-challenge, was observed in haemocytes from adult abalones. While maximal upregulation of both genes in the whole individual occurred at 24 h post-challenge, in juveniles.

However, the relative long-term effects of hypoxia on bivalves, including abalone, are not well understood. In this study, we examined the effects of exposure to hypoxic (2.5 and 4 mg O-2 L-1) and normoxic (8 mg O-2 L-1) conditions on the growth, survival, and immune and antioxidant responses of the economically important Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai over a 4 month period. We observed that exposure to 2.5 mg O-2 L-1 resulted in marked reductions in assessed shell parameters, average meat weight, and survival compared with exposure to 4 and 8 mg O-2 L-1. There were also significant reductions in oxygen consumption and ammonia-N excretion in abalone exposed to 2.5 mg O-2 L-1. We also detected initial immunosuppression in the 2.5 mg O-2 L-1 -treated abalone, as evidenced by a significant reduction in total hemocytes and inhibition of antibacterial and lysozyme activities. Furthermore, intracellular malondialdehyde concentrations were significantly elevated at 1 month in the 2.5 mg O-2 L-1 treatment group, whereas there were reductions in the levels of glutathione and enzymatic activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase, thereby indicating potential hypoxia-induced oxidative stress and a depression of antioxidant capacity. After 4 months of treatment, severe hypoxia (2.5 mg O-2 L-1) had significantly modulated all measured parameters, whereas exposure to 4 and 8 mg O-2 L(-1 )had induced no significant effects. Collectively, our observations indicate that under long-term exposure to hypoxia, Pacific abalone failed to maintain an effective antioxidant defense system and adequate immunity, with the observed biochemical disruptions leading to a reduction in growth and survival.",10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105596,"Rhee, Jae-Sung/0000-0003-3313-8850; Haque, Dr.Md.Niamul/0000-0002-2571-1285",0166-445X,1879-1514,,OCT,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105596,32827874

To explore the potential roles of invertebrate IKKs on immunity, three IKK encoding genes have been identified from molluscan species disk abalone and designed as AbIKK1, AbIKK2 and AbIKK3 at the transcriptional level. Coding sequences of AbIKK1, AbIKK2 and AbIKK3 encode the peptides of 746, 751 and 713 amino acids with the predicted molecular mass of 86.16, 86.12 and 81.88 kDa respectively. All three AbIKKs were found to share conserved IKK family features including the kinase superfamily domain (KD), ubiquitin-like domain (ULD), and alpha-helical scaffold/dimerization domain (SDD), similar to their mammalian counterparts. Under normal physiological conditions, AbIKKs were ubiquitously detected in six different tissues, with the highest abundance in the digestive tract and gills. Temporal transcriptional profiles in abalone hemocytes revealed the induction of AbIKK1, AbIKK2, and AbIKK3 expression following exposure to Gram-negative (Vibrio parahemolyticus) and Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes) bacteria, viruses (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, VHSV), LPS, or poly I:C. The overexpression of AbIKKs in HEK293T or RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells induced NF-kappa B promoter activation independent of stimulation by TNF-alpha or LPS. Moreover, iNOS and COX2 expression was induced in AbIKK transfected RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells and the induced state was maintained post-LPS treatment. Furthermore, mRNA levels of three selected cytokine-encoding genes (IL-1 beta, IL6, and TNF-alpha) were found to be elevated in abalone IKK overexpressed RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells, both with and without LPS exposure.

L-ascorbyl-2-molyphosphate (LAMP) was added to the basal diet to formulate four experimental diets containing 0.0, 70.3, 829.8 and 4967.5 mg AA equivalent kg(-1) diets, respectively. Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of adult abalone in acrylic tanks (200 L) in a flow-through seawater system. Each tank was stocked with 15 abalone. Animals were fed once daily (17:00) to apparent satiation for 24 weeks. The results showed that the dietary AA (703 mg kg(-1)) could significantly up-regulate the expression levels of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), feritin (FT) and heat shock protein 26 (HSP26) in the hepatopancreas of abalone in this treatment compared to the controls. However, the expression levels of Mn-SOD, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx), selenium-binding protein (SEBP), HSP70 and HSP90 were significantly down-regulated. Compared with those in the group with 70.3 mg kg(-1) dietary AA, the expression levels of CAT, GST and HSP26 were decreased in abalone fed with very high dietary AA (4967.5 mg kg). In addition, significant up-regulations of expression levels of Mn-SOD, GPX, TPx, SEBP, FT, HSP70, HSP90 and NF-kappa B were observed in abalone fed with apparently excessive dietary AA (829.8 and 4967.5 mg kg(-1)) as compared to those fed 70.3 mg kg(-1) dietary AA. These findings showed that dietary AA influenced the expression levels of antioxidant proteins, heat shock proteins and NF-kappa B in the hepatopancreas of abalone at transcriptional level.

Although seven STAT members have been reported in mammals, very limited information on STAT genes in molluscans is available. In this study, we identified and characterized a STAT paralog that is homologous to STAT5 from the disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus, and designated as AbSTAT5. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence for AbSTAT5 (790 amino acids) with other counterparts revealed conserved residues important for functions and typical domain regions, including the N-terminal domain, coiled-coil domain, DNA-binding domain, linker domain, and Src homology 2 (SH2) domains as mammalian counterparts. Analysis of STAT phylogeny revealed that AbSTAT5 was clustered with the molluscan subgroup in STAT5 Glade with distinct evolution. According to the genomic structure of AbSTAT5, the coding sequence was distributed into 20 exons with 19 introns. Immunologically essential transcription factor-binding sites, such as GATA-1, HNF, SP1, C/EBP, Oct-1, AP1, c-Jun, and Sox-2, were predicted at the 5'-proximal region of AbSTAT5. Expression of AbSTAT5 mRNA was detected in different stages of embryonic development and observed at considerably higher levels in the morula and late veliger stages. Tissue-specific expressional studies revealed that the highest level of AbSTAT5 transcripts was detected in hemocytes, followed by gill tissues. Temporal expressions of AbSTAT5 were analyzed upon live bacterial (Vibrio parahemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes), viral (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus), and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (lipopolysaccharides and Poly I:C) stimulations, and significant elevations indicated immune modulation. These results suggest that AbSTAT5 may be involved in maintaining innate immune responses from developmental to adult stages in the disk abalone.

Seven semi-purified diets with graded levels of AA (0, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 5000 mg/kg) were fed to abalone (initial weight: 12.01 +/- 0.001 g, initial shell length: 48.44 +/- 0.069 mm) for 100 days. The survival, weight gain rate and daily increment in shell length were not affected by dietary AA. The AA content in the gill, muscle and digestive glands of abalone was significantly increased by dietary AA. In terms of immunity, dietary AA significantly improved the total hemocyte count, respiratory burst and phagocytic activity in hemolymph, and lysozyme activity in cell-free hemolymph (CFH). In the digestive gland, the TLR-MyD88-dependent and TLR-MyD88-independent signaling pathways were suppressed by dietary AA supplementation. The mRNA levels of beta-defensin and arginase-I in the digestive gland were significantly increased by dietary AA. In the gill, only the TLR-MyD88-dependent signaling pathway was depressed by dietary AA to reduce inflammation in abalone. The level of mytimacin 6 in the gill was significantly upregulated by dietary AA. After Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection, the TLR signaling pathway in the digestive gland was suppressed by dietary AA, which reduced inflammation in the abalone. In terms of anti-oxidation, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities, as well as total anti-oxidative capacity and reduced glutathione content in CFH, were all significantly upregulated. The malondialdehyde content was significantly downregulated by dietary AA. The anti-oxidative capacity was improved by triggering the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway in abalone. In terms of apoptosis, dietary AA could enhance the anti-apoptosis ability via the JNK-Bcl-2/Bax signaling cascade in abalone.

The blacklip abalone Haliotis rubra was rarely eaten on most reefs, but aggregations of the starfish were found feeding on abalone at some times and places where other suitable prey were scarce. Where abalone were eaten, a higher proportion of small abalone were eaten than larger ones. Starfish preferred small abalone to mussels of the same weight in laboratory choice experiments, and the time required for the starfish to eat mussels and abalone of the same size were similar. Previously unobserved aspects of the escape response of abalone may explain the variable rate of predation on abalone by C. calamaria. Abalone displayed various behavioural responses to attack that increase the likelihood of escaping. One response apparently involves the production of a chemical deterrent in the abalone epithelium. It appears that as a result abalone are not often eaten unless mussels stocks are depleted and the starfish are al high densities. This is most likely on offshore reefs where abundant mussel recruitment in most years sustains large numbers of C. calamaria.",10.1080/10236249509378925,"Dowell, Ashley/0000-0001-9297-1709; Day, Robert/0000-0001-5913-2292",1023-6244,1029-0362,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10236249509378925,

This factor greatly affects crucial biological process such as feeding rates, energy balance, physiological stress status, and consequently, growth and survival of farmed abalone. Most of these effects have been studied in the economically valuable abalone Haliotis discus hannai. The use of specific photoperiods, and/or light qualifies and intensifies, have been proposed as managing strategies to increase its production; however, for extensive off-shore or in intensive land-based farming systems, lighting conditions are not likely to be easily managed. Despite the great importance of the biological responses to the light/dark stimuli for abalone farming production, to the best of our knowledge the genetic control upon the variation associated behavioral traits have not been studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the heritable variation and potential responses to selection for the phototaxis [i.e., displacement towards (positive) or against (negative) the light source] and locomotion behaviors associated to the intensity of the response (i.e., crawling speed and displacement distance) to the light/dark stimuli in juvenile H. discus hannai. Genetic and phenotypic correlations between these traits were also estimated. Results showed moderate but significant heritable variations for phototaxis (h(2) = 0.15) and locomotion responses (h(2) = 0.18-0.37); and significant positive genetic correlations among them. Expected gain responses to selection per generation (with a selection intensity of 2.06, i.e., selecting 5% of the individuals from a population) were moderate for phototaxis variation (16%) and high for locomotion responses variation (33-67 or 36-73%, depending on the model used for the estimations).

Recently, dietary macro-algae supplementation has gained interest as an promoter of health and growth in abalone. In this study, the effects of three graded levels of dietary protein (35, 41 and 47 %) and 15 % dietary supplementation of dried and ground Ulva lactuca on the digestion and excretion processes in juvenile Australian hybrid abalone (Haliotis rubra x H. laevigata) were investigated through analysis of metabolic oxygen consumption (M(center dot)O2 ) and nitrogen excretion (M(center dot)NH4+-N) during meal digestion and assimilation. Trials were conducted at three farm-relevant acclimation temperatures (12, 17 and 22 degrees C), and abalone acclimated to the highest temperature were additionally subjected to a simulated heatwave. Within the ranges of 35 and 47 % dietary crude protein, no differences were observed in total postprandial energy use, however, significant differences were observed between the three temperatures. Similarly, differences in nitrogen excretion were observed across temperatures but not across dietary protein treatments. Dietary supplementation of U. lactuca led to significantly higher peak and total M(center dot)O2 throughout the postprandial period at 22 degrees C. Additionally, total NH+4 -N excretion was higher at 17 degrees C when abalone were fed the U. lactuca supplemented diet. No differences in survival were observed between any of the dietary treatments when juvenile abalone underwent the simulated heatwave, however, the 15 % U. lactuca treatment did exhibit consistently higher M(center dot)O2 .

Most commercial abalone nurseries settle larvae onto vertical plastic plates coated in a film of algae that acts as a settlement cue and an important postsettlement food source. As abalone grow, their food consumption increases exponentially, and it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain an adequate supply of algal food. Even grazing-resistant algae, like Ulvella lens, are often depleted when abalone reach 3-5 mm SL, requiring nurseries to provide additional algae or to wean the juveniles prematurely onto manufactured diets. Early weaning typically results in slower growth and higher mortality relative to live algal feeds. The current study tested various algal species to aid early weaning of the abalone Haliotis iris. Two experiments were conducted pairing nursery tanks of similar environmental conditions to test a total of three algal treatments: (1) the benthic diatom Nitzschia longissima, (2) a film of N. longissima and U. lens, and (3) a film of N. longissima and a naturally occurring mixture of green algal species that remained on weaning tank surfaces after a previous cohort of abalone had been harvested from the tank. Algae were established prior to the introduction of juvenile (SL, 2-7 mm) H. iris at a density of 15,000-30,000 abalone per tank (2.5 m(3) water volume, 13 m(2) surface area). The abalone were raised to approximately 15 mm SL with twice-weekly supplementary feeding of suspended N. longissima during the first 4 wk, and the addition of manufactured feed 3 times a day for the duration of the experiment. The N. longissima films were completely removed by grazing within 4-5 days whereas the green algal films persisted for 60-120 days. Despite the difference in resilience of algal films, there was no significant difference (P>0.05) in abalone performance between treatments 1 (98.7% survival, growth of 85 mu m/day) and 2(98.3% survival, growth of 92 mu m/day). In a second experiment, treatment 2 provided slightly greater growth than the mixed algal film of treatment 3 (101 mu m/day vs. 96 mu m/day, P = 0.034), but survival rates were similar (98.2% vs. 98.3%, P = 0.86). All 3 algal treatments offer practical and effective means of weaning H. iris onto manufactured feeds at an SL of more than 3 mm.

Increases in itaconic acid, decreases in fatty acids, and increases in amino acids were found in hepatopancreas tissues. The alterations of these metabolites suggest osmotic stress, oxidative stress, changes in amino acid metabolism and protein synthesis in the immune system of P. canaliculus caused by Vibrio sp. infection.

Abalone consumed three phenolic-poor algal species, Laminaria sinclarii (Harvey) Farlow, Macrocystis pyrifera Agardh, and Nereocystis luetkeana Postels et Ruprecht (mean phenolic content = 0.52% dry mass), at a greater rate than two phenolic-rich species, Dictyoneurum californicum Ruprecht and Cystoseira osmundacea Agardh (mean phenolic content = 4.60% dry mass). This inverse relationship between phenolic content and consumption rate also existed after the algae were macerated and the liquid portion of the blended slurry incorporated in agar discs. However, the correlation between grazing rate and phenolic content improved in this latter experiment, thus suggesting that abalone grazing was deterred significantly by the morphology of L. sinclarii and, to a lesser extent, of M. pyrifera. Polyphenolics extracted from D. californicum reduced abalone grazing rates by 90% when incorporated into agar discs at a concentration of 6 mg.ml-1. Although abalone were unable to maintain body mass when fed ad libitum on macerated M. pyrifera incorporated into agar discs, polyphenolics from D. californicum further inhibited shell growth when added to the discs at 5 mg.ml-1. The abalone ate less of the phenol-containing discs than of the discs lacking phenolics. Our results support findings of several prior studies that polyphenolic compounds from brown algae deter grazing by coastal zone herbivores in the northeast Pacific Ocean.",10.1016/0022-0981(92)90067-K,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-0981(92)90067-K,

While numerous studies have examined the direct effects of temperature on species fitness, fewer studies have analyzed how individual impacts may translate to downstream primary consumers. Temperature-induced changes in the nutritional quality of seaweed may cause critical shifts in energy and nutrient availability for these consumers. A multifaceted experiment was conducted to assess the indirect impacts of California's coastal climate conditions on abalone growth. This experiment fed juvenile red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) of two different size classes in ambient water conditions with the seaweed dulse (Devaleraea mollis), conditioned at 13 degrees C, 15 degrees C, and 17 degrees C for 92 days. Nutritional analyses revealed significantly higher protein and nitrogen content in the 17 degrees C dulse culture than in the 15 degrees C and 13 degrees C cultures, and no significant differences in carbohydrates. Furthermore, analyses on body weight ratio and condition factor indicate that juvenile red abalone of smaller size display significantly better growth and condition when fed dulse cultured at higher temperatures.

This paper gives an overview of the development of the South African abalone industry and analyses how abalone farming, natural kelp beds and seaweed harvesting are interlinked. It discusses options and constraints for expanding the abalone industry, focussing especially on abalone feed development to meet this growing demand. Kelp will continue to play an important role as feed and kelp areas previously not utilised may become cost-effective to harvest. There are many benefits from on-farm seaweed production and it will probably be a part of future expansion of the abalone industry. Abalone waste discharges are not at present regarded as a major concern and fanning brings important employment opportunities to lower income groups in remote coastal communities and has positive spillover effects on the seaweed industry and abalone processing industry.

Finally, these candidate genes were further proved to be associated with the hightemperature resistance trait of DF by the analysis of differential expression genes between sensitive and tolerant individuals. These candidate genes involved regulatory mechanisms such as cell stability, protein repair, lipid metabolism and immune regulation. Notably, the mechanism by which the e3rglg4 gene was involved in the degradation of abnormally folded proteins of abalone under heat stress, corroborating the reliability of the results of GWAS and Sequenom MassARRA.

In this study, we explored the effect of changing seawater temperature on the foraging and hiding behaviors of the juvenile Pacific abaloneHaliotis discus hannai.First, we tested whether their hiding behavior in response to light differs depending on the temperature (11 degrees C, 14 degrees C, and 17 degrees C) when only artificial shelter was provided. We observed that the abalones hid under the shelter much faster at 17 degrees C than at 11 degrees C. Second, we tested whether their hiding and foraging behaviors changed in response to increasing temperature when both food and shelter were provided. At high water temperature (17 degrees C), abalones emerged more quickly than at low water temperature (11 degrees C), and the total number of feeding abalones was higher at high temperature than that at low temperature. However, the hiding speed in response to light in the morning was not significantly different among different temperatures. These results suggest that although the basic response to a single stimulus (i.e., light or food) was faster at higher temperatures than at lower temperatures, abalones may increase their boldness under higher temperatures when deciding whether to feed or hide.",10.1007/s12601-020-0024-8,,1738-5261,2005-7172,,SEP,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12601-020-0024-8,

This view is challenged by recent laboratory studies which show that marine invertebrate embryos of some nonarthropodan phyla are able to transport and use dissolved organic material (DOM, e.g. amino acids and fatty acids) in seawater as a source of material (energy) for metabolic needs and growth. Here we present results of experiments conducted in situ (in Antarctica and N. Pacific) and in the laboratory, which show that embryos could, in some cases, meet the metabolic costs of embryonic development and increase in organic weight (biomass) prior to being able to feed on particles. Increases in biomass of embryos of temperate species correlated with the timing of spring phytoplankton blooms. In contrast, the biomass of embryos (of temperate species) reared during periods of low primary productivity decreased, or remained constant. Phytoplankters exude DOM into seawater and these exudates are shown here to enhance embryonic growth. In most cases, there was no net use of endogenous reserves during prefeeding development; growth and energy needs were apparently met through consumption of DOM in seawater. We suggest that DOM is an important food source for embryos of soft-bodied marine invertebrates in polar and temperate oceans.",10.3354/meps109173,,0171-8630,,,JUN,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps109173,

Fish meal production relies on finite wild-marine resources and is considered as an unsustainable ingredient. Insect meal (IM) is considered a sustainable source with high levels of protein suitable for growth promotion. Grape marc (GM) is a waste byproduct of the winery industry rich in pigments with antioxidant capacity. However, the inclusion of both ingredients can affect the flavor of the meat of abalone and the color of the shell due to different nutritional profiles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the dietary inclusion of IM and GM on the flavor volatile compounds and shell color of the juvenile Haliotis iris in a 165-days feeding trial. Abalone were offered four experimental diets with different levels of IM and GM inclusion and a commercial diet (no IM or GM). Soft bodies of abalone were used to characterize volatile compounds using solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and color changes were analyzed in ground powder of abalone shells using color spectrophotometry 400-700 nm (visible). The results showed 18 volatile compounds significantly different among the dietary treatments. The inclusion of IM did not significantly affect the flavor volatile compounds detected, whereas the inclusion of GM reduced volatile compounds associated with lipid-peroxidation in abalone meat. The inclusion of IM and GM did not significantly affect the lightness nor the yellowness, blueness, redness, and greenness of the ground shells.

Undaria pinnatifida is an edible and expensive seaweed conventionally used in abalone diets. The study was conducted to evaluate Sargassum horneri as a substitute for U. pinnatifida in high plant protein diets for juvenile Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus). Dried and ground U. pinnatifida and S. horneri were used for the experiment. Diets were formulated to contain 100 g kg-1 fish meal and 300 g kg-1 seaweed meal. Control diet (SA0) was prepared including 300 g kg-1 U. pinnatifida meal. Three other diets were designed to contain 100, 200, and 300 g kg-1 S. horneri (SA10, SA20, and SA30) by replacing U. pinnatifida meal from control. Triplicate groups of abalones stored in fifteen plastic baskets were hand-fed one of four experimental diets or dried U. pinnatifida once every other day for 16 weeks. Growth performance of abalone fed SA10 and SA20 diets were comparable to SA0 and U. pinnatifida groups. Hemolymph non-specific immune parameters were significantly higher in SA20 group compared to SA0 and U. pinnatifida groups (p < 0.05). Moisture and lipid levels in edible portions of abalone fed S. horneri diets were significantly higher than in control (p < 0.05). Water stability was higher in SA0 diet and gradually decreased with the increase of S. horneri meal in diets. After air exposure, abalone fed S. horneri diets exhibited higher survival than SA0 and U. pinnatifida groups. Therefore, S. horneri can be used to replace U. pinnatifida from abalone diets.

This lack of response was caused by chemical suppressants, rather than by lack of stimulatory compounds. Excitatory responses were induced by single, low molecular weight compounds, but these responses were inhibited by suppressants which occur naturally in the muscle fraction. Amino and organic acids were found highly stimulatory to lobsters, but nucleotides and sugars were not. A mixture of monocarboxylic amino acids and dicarboxylic organic acids was much more effective in eliciting behavior than either of the constituents tested alone, at the same overall concentration. Mixtures which combined either ammonium or urea with amino or organic acids significantly reduced behavioral activity caused by these latter substances.

Competent larvae (10 days old at 16 degreesC) were induced to attach and metamorphose with 2 muM GABA. Post-larvae were either fed diatoms (Nitzschia longissima) or starved. In Experiment 1, post-larvae were starved immediately after metamorphosis for periods of 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 20, 25 and 30 days. Starved post-larvae grew relatively well for several days after metamorphosis despite the absence of food (averages of 10.4 and 17.8 mum shell length (SL) per day after 8 days for two batches). Subsequent growth was minimal, averaging 1.7 and 0.7 mum day(-1) over 6-7 days for the two batches, There was no clear relationship between period of starvation and growth rate when fed. Mean daily growth rate over 3 weeks when fed ranged from similar to 15-22 mum day(-1). However, the duration of starvation did have a significant effect on survival. Survival of post-larvae fed after 1-2 days of starvation was 90-100% after 3 weeks of feeding. Longer starvation periods gave progressively lower survival and post-larvae starved for 30 days all died within a week of being fed. In Experiment 2, post larvae were fed for 3 weeks after metamorphosis, then starved for 0, 3, 7, 14 or 21 days. Growth rates of starved post-larvae averaged only 5-6 mum day(-1) in the first week (vs. 30 mum day(-1) in controls), and later declined to zero. Growth resumed within a week following return to food, but the 14- and 21-day starvation treatments took 2 weeks to reach growth rates comparable to controls. The no-starvation controls and the 3- and 7-day starvation treatments all had > 70% survival over 4 weeks after return to food. Survival in the 14- and 21-day starvation treatments was 15-20%, with almost all mortalities occurring in the first week after return to food. These data suggest that Haliotis iris post-larvae are relatively tolerant of starvation, so abalone farmers have a week or so to remedy food shortages before major post-larval mortality begins.

After feeding for 100 days, the results of the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that the enriched GO terms of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Se15 and Se30 groups were mainly focused on the cellular components, whereas the GO terms enriched in the Se60 group were mainly related to the metabolism of nutrients and the activities of various enzymes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the DEGs of the Se30 group were mainly enriched in various disease pathways, whereas the DEGs of the Se60 treatment were associated with the metabolism of various nutrients. Further analysis of DEGs showed that toxic dietary concentrations of Se decreased the immunity of abalone by affecting the biosynthesis and metabolism pathways of various nutrients. Additionally, toxic dietary concentrations of Se retarded the growth of abalone by decreasing the expression of various genes associated with shell formation, including lustrin A, perlucin, perlustrin, dermatopontin, chitin synthase, and chitinase as well as the genes associated with muscle production, including collagen, myosin heavy chain, myosin essential light chain, and paramyosin.

GIE time was also assessed using radiography. GIE times were significantly affected by water temperature (P < 0.001) and age (P < 0.05). GIE times decreased for both age classes with increasing temperatures, and the GIE time of 2-y-olds was significantly faster than for 3-y-olds. GIE times never exceeded 60 h. There was no significant effect of either factor on the duration that the marker diet was voided, suggesting that differences in GIE times are due to factors other than the transit of feed through the intestine. Dry matter ADCs were not affected by temperature (P > 0.05) but were affected by age (P < 0.001; 2-y-old <3-y-old). Protein and energy ADCs were not affected by temperature or age. Results may be used to predict purging times and also indicate that further investigations into feeding frequencies are recommended. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It is hypothesised that spirulina algae, which are high in protein, may be a suitable feed ingredient for weaning abalone. Over a period of 27 days, the growth and survival of juvenile (4-6 mm shell length) Haliotis midae were compared when weaned from diatoms onto agar-bound, 48% protein diets with either spirulina, fishmeal, or fishmeal and spirulina as the sources of nutrition. Agar-gel alone was used as a control (0% protein) and a commercial abalone diet, Abfeed (R)-S34 (34% protein), was included as a reference. Abalone that were fed fishmeal and spirulina combined performed best in both weight and shell-length gain (36.87 +/- 2.19 mg and 2.29 +/- 0.05 mm). The growth of agar-fed control animals was worst of all treatments (1.26 +/- 2.03 mg and 0.19 +/- 0.14 mm) and had a markedly reduced survival rate (18.6 +/- 5.5%). Growth in abalone that were fed the spirulina only (9.41 +/- 3.39 mg and 0.58 +/- 0.27 mm) was better than the control-fed abalone and was substantially lower than other diet treatments, but not significantly different from them.

Four diets (a commercial reference and iso-nutrient diets containing fish silage oil, unprocessed rainbow trout viscera or shrimp protein hydrolysate) were evaluated both with and without addition of 2 g kg(-1) dietary formic acid, thus yielding a total of eight treatments, in feeding trials with cultured South African abalone Haliotis midae. Results indicated that inclusion of unprocessed rainbow trout viscera without formic acid decreased production performance of experimental animals, as evidenced by significantly decreased final animal weight and daily weight gain, and significantly increased feed conversion ratio compared to the iso-nutrient control. The decreased production performance was attributed to decreased feed water stability of the diet incorporating untreated trout viscera. Dietary formic acid supplementation partially mitigated the negative impacts of viscera inclusion on production performance of the experimental animals, as seen in significantly higher final animal weight and daily weight gain, and lower feed conversion ratio when compared to non-formic acid-supplemented, viscera-containing diet. However, no beneficial effects on production performance or water stability were found upon formic acid inclusion in diets not containing trout viscera.

Meanwhile, phagocytosis was inhibited, but apoptosis, reactive oxygen species formation, and caspase 3 expression were significantly induced (p < 0.01), and they were all suppressed with 14-3-3 zeta knockdown (p < 0.01). The differences were that silencing 14-3-3 epsilon reverted the decline in the phagocytic rate derived from bacterial infection, while ROS formation was not influenced significantly. In addition, the expression levels of several antimicrobial peptide and proinflammatory cytokine genes were also decreased with the silencing of 14-3-3 genes.

The growth rate of antibiotic-treated H. midae was extremely poor in comparison to abalone that had not been treated with antibiotics when fed an unsupplemented kelp diet, reflecting the importance of gastrointestinal microflora in abalone growth. Alginate Iyase activity in the H. midae digestive tract was significantly higher in abalone fed kelp supplemented with strain C4 compared to abalone fed unsupplemented kelp. Antibiotic-treated abalone incorporated C-14-labelled strain C4 proteins into their tissue.

In postlarvae of similar to 0.5 mm SL, a rachidian tooth (R), 2 pairs of lateral teeth (L1, L2), and 2-3 pairs of marginal teeth (M) per row were present. Only the number of marginal teeth increased to 12-13 pairs per row by 1.5 mm SL. An additional 2 pairs of lateral teeth (L3. L4) were added progressively from 1.5-2 mm SL. The L5 teeth were added at about 6 mm SL. Postlarvae with < 2 mm SL had strongly curved rachidian and lateral teeth with clearance angles of -15 degrees to 20 degrees. Each tooth had many serrations on the working edges. These structures of the teeth are probably suitable for collecting biofilm components such as extracellular mucus of diatoms. Postlarvae with > 2.5 mm SL had higher clearance angles of 20 degrees to 35 degrees. Serrations on the working edges of rachidian and lateral teeth became progressively shallower. These changes suggest that the teeth are more suitable for grazing substrata to efficiently remove strongly attached diatoms. As abalone grew larger than 2 mm SL, the L3 and L4 teeth became longer than R, L1, and L2. The radula development of H. diversicolor aquatilis shown in this study is similar to that of H. discus hannai. However, it is suggested that the feeding transitions in the postlarval stage occur later in H. diversicolor aquatilis than in H. discus hannai.

The sizes of L4 and L5 teeth of juvenile and adult H. diversicolor aquatilis were much smaller than L3 teeth, whereas sizes of L3-L5 teeth were not clearly different in H. discus hannai.

The mode of growth enhancement could not be established; it could not be shown that the acid and salt treatments or the AGP had any effects on intestinal microflora, but possible energy effects of the acids were eliminated as potential mechanism; it is unclear what role gut acidification played in the enhanced growth performance.

Temperature is a crucial environmental factor influencing abalone's physiology and energetics, leading to a change in nutritional requirements. However, feeds are generally formulated to match the nutritional requirements at their optimal temperature. Hence, there is a need to optimise dietary protein levels to match temperature-specific requirements during extreme conditions (winter and summer). Given this, a growth trial evaluating five experimental feeds consisting of graded protein inclusion levels (320, 350, 380, 410, and 440 g center dot kg(-1)) was conducted on subadult hybrid abalone (Haliotis rubra x H. laevigata) at three different temperatures reflecting winter (12 degrees C), summer (22 degrees C), and the annual average water temperature (17 degrees C) for 143 days. At lower water temperature (12 degrees C), there was a marginal improvement in growth performance as dietary protein levels increased from 320 to 440 g center dot kg(-1). However, at higher water temperatures (when the culture water temperature is above 17 degrees C), there was a significant improvement in growth performance as dietary protein levels increased from 320 to 440 g center dot kg(-1) as evidenced by an improved weight gain, specific growth rate, and feed conversion ratio. Furthermore, increasing dietary protein levels did not compromise the nutritional quality of the abalone tissue at all three tested temperatures. Therefore, during periods of higher water temperatures, feeding Australian hybrid abalone with a relatively high dietary protein level (410 g center dot kg(-1)) is expected to result in improved growth, shorter culture duration, and profit maximisation.",10.1155/2023/1676340,"Mock, Thomas/0000-0002-5341-3488; Francis, David/0000-0002-4829-6926; Turchini, Giovanni/0000-0003-0694-4283; Rocker, Melissa Marie/0000-0002-1630-8312",1355-557X,1365-2109,,Feb-04,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2023/1676340,

Agar was used as a binding agent and served as a carbohydrate source to make formulated diets. Post-larval abalone were settled on plastic plates and cultured in fiberglass reinforced plastics (FRP) tanks treated with 0.2 ppm ozone. Two experimental conditions, one with shading (90% light shading) and the other without shading were provided. The postlarval abalone were fed with (a) natural diatom biofilm (without diet supplementation, (b) formulated diet containing only agar, (c) formulated diet containing agar and Chlorella powder and (d) formulated diets containing 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0% emulsified fish oil and agar. Experimental duration was 35 days and survival, growth rate, daily growth rate, the amount of bacteria and attached diatoms were identified every 7 days. In the shading condition, post-larval abalone fed a formulated diet supplemented with 0.5% emulsified fish oil and a diet supplemented with Chlorella powder had a significantly higher daily growth rate than those fed other diets. Their daily growth rate in shell length was 78.5 mu m/day and 77.5 mu m/day, respectively. Postlarval abalone fed the diet with 0.5% emulsified fish oil had a significantly higher survival (35.1%) than those fed diets supplemented with only agar, Chlorella powder or natural diatom biofilm. For the treatment groups without shading, post-larval abalone fed a diet with 2% emulsified fish oil had significantly higher final size (3708 mu m) and daily growth rate (98.8 mu m/day shell length) than those fed diets supplemented with only agar or natural diatom biofilm.

Two diatoms, Amphora luciae Cholnoky and Navicula cf, lenzii Hustedt, supported high postlarval growth and survival, especially when supplied in combination. A third species, Nitzschia laevis Hustedt, did not support survival for more than two weeks as a unialgal diet and had limited value in mixed diets. Diatom mixtures were superior to single-species diets as of the first week after settlement. The mixture of N. cf lenzii and A. lucia supported the highest survival, up to 50%, and growth rate up to 36 mu m of shell length per day, reaching a size of 1.4mm 30 days after settlement. The three diatom species contained high levels of total lipids (6.4%-14.5% of dry weight) and fatty acids (16%-22% of lipids); from 39% to 48% of fatty acids were polyunsaturated (PUFA). The three diatoms were richer in n-3 PUFA than in n-6 PUFA. The content of the essential fatty acid 20:5n-3 (EPA) was highest among the PUFAs and higher, though not significantly, in the two diatom species A. luciae and N. cf. lenzii that produced the better results. Among the free amino acids, arginine was dominant in N. laevis, proline in N. cf. lenzii, and both free amino acids plus glutamic acid were equally dominant in A. luciae. The suitability of A. luciae and N. cf lenzii for enhancing growth and survival of postlarvae was attributed to their complementary balanced nutritional properties. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Both Cu and Zn were effectively accumulated by the abalones from water or macroalgae, but their concentration factors and trophic transfer factors were low due to the regulation of Cu and Zn accumulation. Following waterborne or dietary exposure, the abalones exhibited different accumulation patterns of Cu and Zn. The tissue Zn burden decreased quickly after the initial accumulation, and the incoming Zn was mainly deposited in the viscera. In contrast, the tissue Cu burden increased rapidly and gradually reached a steady state. The abalone muscle exhibited a comparable storage capacity of Cu as the viscera and the accumulated Cu in muscle was mainly derived from the dissolved phase instead of trophic transfer. The feeding and growth of the abalone were not influenced in all the exposure regimes. Moreover, the significant induction of metallothionein indicated that the bioaccumulated metals were actively detoxified. In the metal-exposed abalones, more Cu was distributed into the biologically detoxified fractions (metallothionein-like protein and/or metal-rich granule), whereas no significant subcellular redistribution of Zn was observed. Our study suggested that the abalone may have high endurance to the contamination of Cu or Zn. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The full length of HdhGPx cDNA was 963 bp with a 669 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 222 amino acids and a 101 bp eukaryotic selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) in 3' untranslated region (UTR). It was showed that HdhGPx has a characteristic codon at (235)TGA(237) that corresponds to selenocysteine (SeC) as U-72. Sequence characterization revealed that HdhGPx contains a characteristic GPx signature motif 2 ((96)LGLPCNQF(103)), an active site motif (179WNFEKF184). In addition, two potential N-glycosylation sites ((112)NGTE(115) and (132)NLTQ(135)) were identified in HdhGPx. 3D modeling analysis showed that the overall structure of HdhGPx monomer had more similarity to human GPx3 than human GPx1. Relatively higher-level mRNA expression was detected in hepatopancreas, mantle and gonad by real-time PCR assays. The relative expression levels of HdhGPx mRNA in hepatopancreas and haemocytes were detected by real-time PCR in abalone fed with nine different diets containing graded levels of selenium (0.15, 1.32 and 48.7 mg kg(-1)), zinc (6.69, 33.85 and 710.63 mg kg(-1)) and iron (29.17, 65.7 and 1267.2 mg kg(-1)) for 20 weeks, respectively. The results showed that the expressions of HdhGPx mRNA were statistically higher at adequate dietary selenium (1.32 mg kg(-1)), zinc (33.85 mg kg(-1)) and iron (65.7 mg kg(-1)) than those in low dietary minerals, respectively. But HdhGPx mRNA expression levels were down-regulated by high contents of dietary selenium (48.7 mg kg(-1)), zinc (710.63 mg kg(-1)) and iron (1267.2 mg kg(-1)), respectively.

In the present study we aimed to describe selected physiological and molecular responses of winter acclimated, cultured H. midae after acute and chronic exposure to 16, 19 and 22 degrees C. During acute (24 h) exposure to 16, 19 and 22 degrees C we found a significant increase in specific rates of oxygen consumption and nitrogen excretion with higher temperature. This corresponded with a higher reliance on proteins to fuel metabolism and coincided with high d-lactate levels at the 16 degrees C and high levels of Hsp70 proteins at all three temperatures. After chronic (1 month) exposure to 16, 19 and 22 degrees C animals compensated for changes in temperature by decreasing their specific oxygen consumption and nitrogen excretion rates with increase in temperature, showing that the animals had a high level of reliance on carbohydrates as food source at 22 degrees C. d-lactate levels were lower than after acute exposure and Hsp70 protein levels were lower at 16 and 19 degrees C, but remained high at 22 degrees C. Total muscle protein levels were lower in 16 and 19 degrees C animals and very high at 22 degrees C, indicating that animals incorporate proteins into their tissue, because they do not rely on protein catabolism to the same extent compared to lower temperatures. We conclude that cold acclimated H. midae have the ability to adapt to high temperatures, within their optimal range for growth, provided that they are exposed to sustained stable temperatures and do not experience short, high temperature spikes. These findings will aid in a better understanding of feed utilization and growth patterns of H. midae in the thermally variable intensive mariculture environment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Feed was fed to excess daily and uneaten food was collected. Temperature significantly affected the specific growth rate of both year classes of abalone. There was no significant effect of dietary protein level on specific growth rate; however, abalone compensated for a reduction of dietary protein by consuming more feed. This observation was evident with significant increases in feed conversion ratios as dietary protein levels decreased for both year classes. With the exception of abalone grown at 14 degrees C, when protein deposition decreased with increasing dietary protein level, protein deposition increased with an increase in dietary protein for both year classes.

In Experiment 1, the level of nitrate in the culture medium did not significantly affect the protein content of Cocconeis sp., Cylindrotheca closterium or Nitzschia ovalis, and variation in the growth of post-larval Haliotis iris was not associated with nitrate level or the protein content of the diatoms. When the same six diatom diets were added daily as cell suspensions, growth and survival were much lower than for the equivalent strains fed as established films (P < 0.0001). In Experiment 2a, the protein content of Navicula incerta was elevated by nitrate supplementation, and the high nitrate strain retained a higher protein content (P=0.005) even after 24 days growing in unenriched, flowing seawater. Haliotis rufescens post-larvae grew significantly faster when fed N. incerta H than when fed N. incerta S (P=0.006) and survival was also higher with this diet (67 versus 54%).

It is not known whether grazing selectivity occurs by postlarvae and young abalones at this time. Thus, experiments were conducted to determine whether discrimination by juveniles of red abalone (Hellions rufescens) occurs while grazing on diatoms that grow on the rocks and kelp blades extracted from their habitat, and to determine whether the ingested diatoms are, indeed, digested. Our hypothesis was that juveniles of H. rufescens would feed nonselectively on the diatom films, thus, the characteristics of the diatom assemblages (species composition, diversity) from their gut contents should be similar to those upon which they feed. We also expected that the smaller forms of diatoms would pass through the digestive tract intact. Overall, 171 diatom taxa were identified: 123 in the tank walls, 35 on the rocks, 143 in the gut contents, and 38 in the feces. Only Amphora pediculus appeared in all the gut contents examined; however, 12 taxa accounted for 80% of the relative abundance (n = 500). Highest diversity ((H) over bar = 4.46) was measured in the walls of a tank where M. pyrifera was included, but abalone specimens from this tank showed the lowest H' value in their gut contents. The hypothesis that grazing by young H. rufescens is nonselective is supported, as well as the importance of the structure of the diatom assemblage grazed upon (as in H. fulgens), which is reflected in their gut contents.

Hybridization is a classical breeding method that can effectively improve the genetic characteristics of organisms through heterosis. Abalone has become an increasingly economically important aquaculture resource with high commercial value. However, due to changing climate, abalone is now facing serious threats of high temperature in summer. Interspecific hybrid abalone (Haliotis gigantea female x H. discus hannai male, SD) has been cultured at large scale in southern China and has been shown high survival rates under heat stress in summer. Therefore, SD has become a good model material for heterosis research, but the molecular basis of heterosis remains elusive. Results Heterosis in thermal tolerance of SD was verified through Arrhenius break temperatures (ABT) of cardiac performance in this study. Then RNA-Sequencing was conducted to obtain gene expression patterns and alternative splicing events at control temperature (20 degrees C) and heat stress temperature (30 degrees C). A total of 356 (317 genes), 476 (435genes), and 876 (726 genes) significantly diverged alternative splicing events were identified in H. discus hannai (DD), H. gigantea (SS), and SD in response to heat stress, respectively. In the heat stress groups, 93.37% (20,512 of 21,969) of the expressed genes showed non-additive expression patterns, and over-dominance expression patterns of genes account for the highest proportion (40.15%). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the overlapping genes among common DEGs and NAGs were significantly enriched in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, mitophagy, and NF-kappa B signaling pathway. In addition, we found that among these overlap genes, 39 genes had undergone alternative splicing events in SD. These pathways and genes may play an important role in the thermal resistance of hybrid abalone. Conclusion More alternative splicing events and non-additive expressed genes were detected in hybrid under heat stress and this may contribute to its thermal heterosis. These results might provide clues as to how hybrid abalone has a better physiological regulation ability than its parents under heat stress, to increase our understanding of heterosis in abalone.",10.1186/s12864-021-07954-y,"Huang, Ze kun/0000-0001-9499-0954; Shen, Yawei/0000-0002-7539-4388; Xiao, Qizhen/0009-0005-7423-0970",1471-2164,,,Sep-08,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07954-y,34496767

Here, we investigated the effects of different dose levels of Co-60 gamma radiation (GR) on tolerance to high temperature (HT) and low salinity (LS) stress and immunological responses in the commercially consumed abalone, Haliotis discus discus. Although H. discus discus exhibited a significantly lower survival rate (SR) at a high level of GR (25 Gy) than the control (0Gy), an increased SR and higher cardiovascular hemocyte counts were exhibited at 20 Gy. Furthermore, enhanced tolerance to HT (30 degrees C) and LS (25 psu) stress, and increased lysozyme activity, were exhibited by the GR-treated H. discus discus groups. Although similar respiratory burst activity after 24 h of stress exposure was exhibited by all of the groups, significantly enhanced superoxide dismutase activity was exhibited in the GR-treated abalone groups under LS stress. Our results indicate that GR-treated H. discus discus exhibit hormetic responses to (CO)-C-60 gamma radiation against environmental stressors because of increased innate immune responses. Statement of relevance It is considered that our study will provide beneficial information about potential use of gamma-radiation techniques for the environmentally-strong abalone production in aquaculture industry.

It has been associated with conditions of high water temperature (>23 degrees C), low dissolved oxygen levels, and a range of other stressful factors in the culture water during summer months. This study aimed to alleviate mortality experienced by abalone at high water temperatures (26 degrees C), by dietary intervention using grape seed extract (GSE) and dried Ulva lactuca Linnaeus, two products which contain antioxidative and bioactive compounds. These products were formulated into a commercial abalone diet at levels of 5 and 30%. The diets were fed to 3-year-old greenlip abalone (26.8 g; 57.9 mm) at a water temperature of 22 or 26 degrees C for 38 days. No mortalities were observed at 22 degrees C. Compared to the unaltered commercial diet, both GSE and dried U. lactuca additive diets significantly increased the survival of abalone at the 26 degrees C water temperature (P<0.05). GSE addition also significantly increased serum superoxide dismutase activity, feed intake, and meal acceptance of the abalone (P<0.05). These results demonstrate the potential for GSE or dried U. lactuca to act as dietary additives to reduce mortality and improve productivity on abalone farms subjected to high summer water temperatures.

We assessed organismal (rates of oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion) and cellular (heat shock protein expression, anti-oxidant enzymes) responses of juvenile and adult abalone exposed to low (similar to 83% of saturation), intermediate (similar to 95% of saturation) and high (similar to 115% of saturation) oxygen levels for one month. Using the Comet assay, we measured DNA damage to determine whether the observed trends in the protective responses were sufficient to prevent oxidative damage to cells. Juveniles were unaffected by moderately hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions. Elevated basal rates of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase were sufficient to prevent DNA fragmentation and protein damage. Adults, with their lower basal rate of anti-oxidant enzymes, had increased DNA damage under hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions, indicating that the antioxidant enzymes were unable to prevent oxidative damage under hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions.

Strain selection involved using individual parent thalli that were found to remain productive under high seawater temperature (26 A degrees C) at Wando. Male and female gametophytes were isolated through 3 cycles of free-living gametophyte culture to produce the F-3 strain used in the production trials. Production trials using the selected strain were initiated every month between December 2014 and March 2015. This delayed the initiation of culture beyond the latest initiation time currently used by farmers (December). Delaying initiation of cultivation resulted in delayed maximum growth compared to the control. Growth of the F-3 strain continued for up to 3 months longer than normally achieved on farms for non-selected thalli. The mean length, growth rate, and biomass were also greater than those achieved by the control strain. The use of the F-3 strain of S. japonica coupled with delayed initiation of culture can therefore be used to help to ensure a stable year round algal feed supply for abalone industry in Korea.",10.1007/s10811-017-1179-2,,0921-8971,1573-5176,,DEC,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-017-1179-2,

It is associated with high water temperature (greater than 23 degrees C), low dissolved oxygen levels, increased bacterial loads, and immune system suppression during summer months. This study aimed to alleviate mortality rates of greenlip abalone by dietary intervention using vitamin K-1 to support the innate immune system and oxidative status. Dietary vitamin K-1 at 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 mg kg(-1) was added to a commercially formulated diet mash. An additional diet containing 0.5 mg kg(-1) of K-3 was also used for comparison. Diets were fed to 3-y-old abalone (71.51 g; 79.91 mm) at 22 and 25 degrees C water temperatures for 39 days. No mortalities were observed at 22 degrees C; however, high mortalities were observed in all dietary treatments at the water temperature of 25 degrees C. Compared with the negative control diet (0.0 mg additional inclusion of K-1 or K-3 kg(-1)) at 25 degrees C, the inclusion of vitamin K-1 or K-3 did not improve survival of greenlip abalone (P > 0.05). Vitamin K-1 inclusion level resulted in significant increases in vitamin K-1 concentration of visceral organ and muscle tissues (P < 0.05). Steady-state levels of vitamin K-1 were not reached. Steady-state levels of K-2-MK-4 in visceral organ and muscle were reached when analyzed levels of dietary vitamin K-1 reached 0.02 mg kg(-1). This was also true for K-2-MK-7, but in the visceral organ only. Vitamin K-1 inclusion level did not significantly affect total hemocyte count, phagocytic activity, or phagocytic index (P > 0.05). Increasing water temperature to 25 degrees C resulted in significant increases in serum catalase activity (22 < 25 degrees C) and vitamin K-1 concentration in muscle tissue (22 < 25 degrees C).

Five treatment diets had supple-mentation with alpha-starch (Sta), dextrin (Dex), pullulan gum (Pg), xanthan gum (Xg), and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). At the end of the feeding trial, the best growth performance (weight gain, 442.23%) and diet efficiency (protein efficiency ratio, 1.25, and feed conversion ratio [FCR], 2.04) were exhibited by the dog conch fed the Sta diet, whereas the lowest growth performance was observed in the dog conch fed the Xg and CMC diets. Dog conch fed the Sta (2.04) diet had a lower FCR than dog conch fed the other experimental diets (3.92e5.46). Apparent dietary digestibility (ADD) was significantly higher in dog conch fed the Sta diet than in the dog conch that were fed the other experimental diets. The ADD of protein was significantly lower in the dog conch fed the CMC diet than in those fed the other dietary treatments. The lowest ADD for energy was observed in the dog conch fed the CMC diet, followed by the Xg diet and Pg diet. Moisture, crude protein, and muscle crude lipid were affected by the carbohydrate source. An increase in carbohydrate complexity in the diet led to an enhancement of crude protein content and muscle crude lipid content. Compared with the other diets, the Sta diet yielded a significantly greater improvement in all shell parameters. These findings indicate that dog conch fed a Sta diet demonstrate the best growth parameters, feed efficiency, and ADD; therefore, diets sup-plemented with Sta are suitable for improving dog conch growth.",10.51400/2709-6998.2686,,1023-2796,2709-6998,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.51400/2709-6998.2686,

The abalone was reared in P-free artificial seawater for 55 days. Results showed that dietary VD3 was hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 [25(OH)D-3] and 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 [1alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3] in abalone, and subsequently raised the serum levels of these two VD3 metabolites. Dietary P deficiency elevated serum 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D-3 level only when the dietary VD3 supplementation was sufficient. The supplementations of either dietary VD3 or P significantly increased the levels of P in serum, mantle and hepatopancreas, and only the addition of VD3 significantly raised the concentrations of Ca in serum and mantle (P < 0. 05). Interaction between dietary VD3 and P was only found significant on the concentrations of P and Mg in mantle (P < 0.05). The concentrations of Ca, P and Mg in muscle were not significantly influenced by these dietary treatments.

Haliotis diversicolor. In the present study, it was further observed that long-term chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of BaP modulated the immunocompetence of abalones in terms of the change in activity of the antioxidant and immune associated parameters tested. In addition, the effect of tributyltin (TBT), another important genotoxicant in the aquatic environment, was investigated. Exposure of abalones to sublethal concentrations of TBT and BaP for 21 days resulted in significant decrease of total hemocyte count, phagocytosis, membrane stability and lysozyme activity. Conversely induction of extra and intra cellular superoxide generation, nitric oxide, nitric oxide synthase and myeloperoxidase activity was present when the abalones were exposed to TBT and BaP. Most of the immune associated parameters tested showed clear time dependent response to both toxicants. Within 14 days after the 21 day exposure to BaP, recovery was observed as evidenced by most of the parameters returning to their normal level. However, no recovery was observed within 14 days after the 21 day exposure to TBT as evidenced by continued elevation of intra cellular superoxide and nitrite production and decrease in THC, membrane stability and lysozyme activity. This suggested a prolonged TBT-induced impact on the immune reaction and possibly more damage than that caused by BaP. Overall the results suggest that chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of TBT or BaP causes modulations in the immunocompetence of abalones with most of the immune associated parameters tested being stimulated, and this might be harmful to the host.

A total of 900 juveniles were observed, starting with individuals having an average length of 20 mm. The abalone juveniles were fed with two species of macroalgae, half of which was Gracilaria chilensis, and the other was half Ulva sp (mass basis), fed ad libitum.

An inadequate diet can result in adverse effects such as late metamorphosis, starvation, slow growth and even death during this phase. Two strategies have been proposed to increase the growth and survival rates of weaning abalone: (i) extending feeding with benthic diatoms and (ii) abalone hybridization via interspecific crosses. To evaluate the efficiency of the two strategies, we assessed the growth and survival rates of postlarvae of pure red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and a hybrid obtained by crossing red abalone females with green abalone (H. fulgens) males. Both crosses were supplied with six different diets consisting of either one macroalgae mono-diet (Macrocystis pyrifera or Ulva ohnoi) or a mixture with Navicula incerta. Overall, cross-specific diets achieved better growth rates, suggesting that each cross may need specific food items (nutrients) during weaning.

In Trial 1, compared to the Con group, no significant differences were observed in final weight (FW), final shell length (FSL), specific growth rate (SGR), or daily increment in shell length (DISL) at 25% KM replacement by RBM. However, 50% KM replacement significantly reduced the FW, FSL, SGR, and DISL compared to the Con group. There were no significant differences in the proximate composition of the soft body tissues of the abalone. In Trial 2, growth performance parameters of the hybrid abalone were significantly improved with increasing levels of betaine in the diets compared to those fed diet RBM50, reaching the maximum value in the B2 group. Consistent with the feed intake results, the hormone concentrations of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and orexins in the digestive gland and cerebral ganglia of abalone were significantly increased when the supplementation level of betaine in the diets was increased to 0.2%. However, no apparent impacts were observed on NPY or orexin concentrations among the B1, B2, and B3 groups. Finally, we suggest 0.4% betaine supplementation along with replacing 50% of the KM with RBM in the hybrid abalone diet. The optimal diet is a cost-effective alternative feed formulation that can reduce the dependence on KM for abalone production in China. This study also demonstrates the potential of betaine as a feed attractant in abalone aquaculture.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.740161,"Ma, Yao-Bin/0000-0003-3344-4719",0044-8486,1873-5622,,Jan-30,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.740161,

The feeding rate increases slowly in the afternoon, approaching sunset and becomes constant between Sunset and midnight. The abalone remain within shaded refuges during the day, and only emerge from them at night. The present study evaluated some effects of varying the photoperiod on a group of these abalone to determine its potential effects on their feeding behavior. Three groups of juvenile abalone with an initial mean length near 14 mm were maintained in raceway cage culture systems with a continuous flow of fresh seawater and abundant food where each group was exposed to different photoperiods. Growth of the abalone in these systems was monitored for a period of 106 days. Treatment A, considered natural, included 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness. In Treatment 13, the abalone were maintained in complete darkness, and Treatment C included four h of light and 20 h of darkness. The results showed that juveniles cultured in total darkness demonstrated some retardation in growth early in the experiment compared with abalone in a natural light regimen, and those with a partial light regimen. After 43 days, the abalone in the partial light regimen reached and surpassed sizes of the abalone maintained in the natural light regimen and in total darkness, although their feeding activity and growth patterns were erratic compared with abalone in the normal light and total darkness regimes. The results of the experiment were inconclusive as to which light regimen was most favorable when considering the growth patterns and comparative mortality rates within the systems.",10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[763:EOTPRO]2.0.CO;2,,0730-8000,,,SEP,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[763:EOTPRO]2.0.CO;2,

Diet was shown not to have a significant effect on the time in which the worms on live hosts reached their maximum size. Diet did, however, influence the maximum size and consequently the growth rate of worms, which were larger and grew faster on kelp-fed abalone than on those fed a commercial pellet diet. Despite diet having no effect on fecundity and offspring size, kelp-fed worms matured earlier. The maximum size of kelp-fed worms was unaffected by the absence of a live host, suggesting that the worms do not rely on the host for food. The absence of a live host reduced the growth and sexual maturation rates of worms. There was no difference in the size of offspring in the two treatments, but fewer worms matured sexually and fewer broods were produced on shells only than on live hosts.

Between 80 and 102 days PS, L5 teeth appeared on the radula and there were fewer lateral serrations, consistent with the adult form of the animal, suggesting that this development is in preparation for feeding on macroalgae. Digestive gland complexity (tubule number and density) increased between 80 and 102 days PS and is consistent with greater enzyme production and increased digestive efficiency. Of the enzymes studied, laminarinase and lipase exhibited the highest activities in animals fed a diatom diet, both significantly increasing with age of the abalone. High laminarinase activities reflect higher utilisation of the algal polysaccharide chrysolaminarin in the diatom diet. Ingestion of artificial diet had no adverse effects on the morphological development of the digestive system, but trypsin activity in abalone fed the artificial diet was significantly higher than diatom-fed abalone of similar age, indicative of higher levels of protein in the artificial diet. Similarly, lipase activity was significantly lower in abalone fed the artificial diet and may reflect an inability to digest the fish oil component, which is not found in their natural diet. Future development of artificial diets, especially for juvenile abalone, should focus on the levels and type of lipid provided. Runt abalone (i.e. under-developed compared to their siblings) had radulae similar to much younger 80 days PS abalone and digestive tissue degradation at 137 days PS is evidence that runts have limited ability to ingest food and are nutritionally compromised.

Fish meal is a key ingredient used in aquaculture feeds due to its nutritional profile and palatability. Alternative ingredients, such as insect meal and grape marc, are potential candidates to be included in aquafeeds due to their suitable nutritional profile and more sustainable production. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of insect meal and grape marc on growth and nutritional profile using abalone as an animal model in a feeding trial for 165 days. Proximate analyses were used to identify nutritional variations in abalone tissue and faecal matter, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography mass-spectrometry analyses were utilised to characterise amino acid and fatty acid composition. Results showed a 95% survival for all treatments. The inclusion of insect meal and grape marc did not affect the protein proportions of abalone tissues, but differences were found in the carbohydrate and lipid proportions.

A volatile breakdown product of DMSP, dimethylsulfide (DMS), was formed in abalone during canning, causing repellent tastes and odours in some batches of canned meat. Abalone adductor muscle displayed high DMSP concentrations compared to other tissues. Further, the feeding regime determined the level to which DMSP accumulated: abalone previously fed Ulva accumulated DMSP to 16162 +/- 3408 mu g g(-1). This was higher than in wild-collected abalone (471 +/- 339 mu g g(-1)) or those fed with manufactured feeds (up to 46.2 +/- 9.6 mu g g(-1)) or Ecklonia (198 +/- 73 mu g g(-1)). A deputation phase prior to processing allowed for the reduction of tissue DMSP levels to those seen in wild abalone. Knowing the DMSP levels in feeds and its behaviour in abalone tissue will lead to the development of new strategies for controlling abalone taste characteristics. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The simulation model assumed five marker loci associated with genes affecting growth rate explained 50% of the genetic variance for this trait. Use of markers associated with improved disease resistance was also modelled. Parameters and simulation scheme used are described. The simulations accounted for the possibility of early induction of reproductive condition to reduce generation intervals and for selective genotyping. Affects on profitability were calculated using estimates from the industry of income and expenses for a typical farm and accounting for the costs associated with marker testing. While the extra genetic gains from MAS were in the order of 15%, if the cost of genotyping each marker per animal was $10 AUS, then M BLUP for growth was only profitable when 75 progeny per family were genotyped. Early selection (halving the generation interval) was advantageous for MBLUP and BLUP provided the number of progeny per family was greater 5, as the advantage of two generations of selection more than compensated for the decreased accuracy of selection for early growth. However accurate estimates of parameters, such as the genetic correlation between early growth rate and growth and age at first spawning, would need to be obtained before considering implementing this strategy. The advantage of MBLUP was greater for disease resistance than for growth rate. Selective genotyping, which would greatly reduced genotyping costs of implementing MBLUP to improve disease resistance, did not greatly reduce the additional response achieved with marker assisted selection.

Less attention has been given to the resulting quality of the seafood product from formulated feeds and the effect of the reduction of marine ingredients in these feeds. Marine n-3 fatty acids are particularly important nutritional factors of seafood that are lacking from feed ingredients at the base of the aquaculture production chain. Considering that this important category of nutrients is already deficient in the western diet, further erosion through cultivated seafood products is of concern. This study tested the effect of three diet categories on the fatty acid profiles of commercially farmed abalone.

The total lipid content of abalone tissue did not vary substantially across diet categories; however, the ratio of n-6:n-3 fatty acids decreased incrementally with the increasing macroalgae content in the diet and by a factor of two with a 100 % macroalgae diet. Also, equal or higher content of all important long chain n-3 fatty acids was achieved with a macroalgae diet despite the lower dietary content of some of these fatty acids.

Despite the continuous improvement in the productivity of domestic abalone aquaculture, rapid seawater temperature changes caused by global warming have led to mass mortality in coastal abalone farms. Therefore, research on environmental stressors is urgently needed to prevent abalone production losses. This study analyzed the expression of heat shock protein (HSP) genes in foot muscles of H. discus hannai and metabolic parameters including glucose, lysozyme, catalase, D-lactate, and trehalose levels in the hemolymph under acute high temperature, low temperature, low salinity, and air exposure. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that HSP20 expression was downregulated in all experimental groups, whereas HSP70 expression increased immediately in all experimental groups except for the low-temperature stress group. Hemolymph analysis showed that glucose and lysozyme levels increased significantly immediately after treatment in all groups, and decreased during the recovery period. Together, the results indicate that low water temperature stress had the smallest effect on abalone among the treatments. We conclude that the other treatments acted as stressors of abalone and that HSP genes, glucose, and lysozyme can be used as stress indicators in H. discus hannai.",10.1111/jwas.12969,"Lee, Hyobin/0000-0002-1921-2746; Lim, Han Kyu/0000-0001-8522-9901",0893-8849,1749-7345,,OCT,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jwas.12969,

Larvae were settled on Ulvella lens and Ulva rigida germlings at a density of 0.5 larvae cm(2) of substrate. Growth and survival, in each dietary treatment, were monitored during ten weeks. Experimental nursery tanks were weekly inoculated with 2 L of the different diatom inoculums (10(5)-10(6) cells mL(-1)). Proximate biochemical compositions were significantly different for the four diatom species. Amphora sp. presented a significantly higher lipid and protein contents with 7.11 +/- 0.29% DW and 18.50 +/- 0.97% DW respectively, while Proschkinia sp. presented the lowest protein content and the highest ash content The fatty acid profiles of the diatoms were variable but remained typical of the diatom family. Larvae contained significantly more lipids (25.30 +/- 0.93% DW) than juveniles. The different fatty acid compositions found for the various diatom species were dissimilar to the ones of larvae, juveniles and substrates; (Courtois de Vicose et al., in press-a) the fatty acid compositions of these last two not being different among treatments. 16:4n - 3, 20:4n - 6 (arachidonic acid, ARA) and 22:5n - 3 (docosapentaenoic acid, DPA) were the most abundant fatty acids in juveniles while 20:5n - 3 (ecosapentaenoic acid, EPA) was the dominant polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), present at a comparable level in all diatoms. This suggests that the post-larvae and juveniles are capable to absorb a selection of fatty acids from the food source or that they are able to synthesise them from precursor dietary fatty acids. Growth rates obtained in the present study are presenting different phases and diatom diets made little difference to growth rate of post-larvae until reaching around 0.8-1 mm SL, after which divergence in growth rate among diets became significant. Post-larvae fed the diatom with the highest protein and lipid contents (Amphora sp.) showed the best daily growth rate (DGR) of 50 +/- 3 mu m over the feeding trial, highlighting the joint influence of diatoms' protein and lipid content on growth. Around 2 mm SL, juveniles exhibited increased growth rates, in all treatments, reaching 94 mu m day(-1), indicating a possible shift in nutrition towards green macroalgae germlings and suggesting that U. lens and U. rigida are used as a complement to the diatom diet at this stage. 18:2n - 6 and 18:3n - 3 found in high amount in all juveniles as well as in all substrates could be an indication of that nutritional shift and could be involved in growth enhancement.

To determine if a candidate aquaculture species, Haliotis kamtschatkana, exhibits density-dependent growth we raised animals at three density levels and two food treatments: unlimited (ad libitum) and rationed (individual portions were the same among density treatments). We also tested for differences in food consumption, foraging patterns and stacking behaviour among the density levels. We observed density-dependent growth in the rationed treatments, indicating that relatively high growth rates at lower densities are driven, in part, by factors other than differences in food consumption. However, overall the quantity of food consumed related directly to growth; treatments fed ad libitum had higher growth rates. Furthermore, even when food was provided in excess, foraging was restricted to similar to 2 h after sunset in all treatments and the amount consumed per abalone was significantly lower at high densities. This is probably because high density animals could not access the food provided: fewer were observed foraging and they had to move from prominent stacks. Our results indicate that both temporal and spatial access to food are critical and that managers can observe foraging and stacking by abalone in tanks to determine if a specific design will limit food consumption, and ultimately growth.

Starved and refed abalone showed slower growth rates (DGR, 63 and 70 mg/day in the 5/5 and 10/10 groups respectively), as a result of reduced food intake (DFI 15% and 16% day(-1) respectively), after repeated starvation and refeeding cycles. Percentage weight gains (5/5 = 196%, 10/10 = 177%) were significantly lower than that of the control (397%). When refed continuously over 60 days, the starved groups exhibited increased DFI and fed at the rate of 24% and 25% day(-1), which were not significantly different from that of the control at 26% day(-1), At the end of the experiment, no significant differences were observed among three treatments in terms of shell length (range: 4648 mm), body weight (range 25-28 g), % weight gain (392-465%) and per cent survival (range 87-98%). The results indicated that H. asinina had a complete compensatory growth following a return to full rations after a series of intermittent starvation and refeeding cycles.",10.1046/j.1365-2109.2002.00656.x,,1355-557X,,,Feb-28,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.2002.00656.x,

Radula morphology was examined by SEM, and compared with that of competent larvae (260-280 mu m shell length (SL)) and adults (125-130 mm SL). Larvae (130 degrees C.days old) had a well-formed radula with similar to 10 rows of teeth. Each row comprised 1 rachidian tooth, 2 pairs of lateral teeth, and 1 pair of marginal teeth. The number of rows of teeth increased to 26-29 by similar to 500 mu m SL (Day 10 post-settlement) and stayed at that level throughout the post-larval period (maximum size/age observed was 2.7 mm SL at Day 60). Marginal teeth were added steadily to give similar to 30 pairs per row at similar to 2.5 mm SL (compared to 60-80 in adults). Lateral teeth (L3-L5) were added between 1.0 and 1.7 mm SL to complete the adult complement. Progressive changes in the post-larval radula above 1-1.5 mm SL included: (1) reduction of serrations on the margins of rachidian and lateral teeth, particularly the more central (R, L1, L2) teeth; (2) increased spacing between adjacent rows of teeth; (3) lengthening of the outer lateral teeth (L3-L5) making them larger and taller than the central (R, L1, L2) teeth. The clearance angle of rachidian and lateral teeth was variable, but generally increased as post-larvae grew. Post-larvae <1 mm SL had highly curved teeth and apparent clearance angles around or below 0 degrees. Larger post-larvae had positive clearance angles. These developments suggest that the teeth of post-larvae <1 mm SL probably function as scoops which slide across the surface collecting small diatoms and other fine, loose particles. Radulae of post-larvae > 1mm SL become more suitable for collecting larger particles, and gouging feeding substrata.",,"Takami, Hideki/0000-0001-5083-8539; Kawamura, Tomohiko/0009-0008-0086-7428",0730-8000,,,DEC,,

This study aimed to assess the effect of culture methods and tank cleaning frequency on abalone growth, water quality, and sludge characteristics. The study was conducted for 16 weeks. Four treatments were used, namely, abalone cocultured with sea cucumber cleaned once (AS1) and twice weekly (AS2); abalone monoculture cleaned once (A1) and cleaned twice weekly (A2). Abalone (initial avg weight = 40.9 g) were maintained under commercial stocking conditions in flow through systems at a salinity of 35 ppt and fed a commercial formulated diet (Abfeed (TM)) and fresh seaweed (Ulva lacinulata and Gracillaria gracilis). The stocking densities were 200 abalone m(-2) and 50 sea cucumbers m(-2). The sea cucumbers (initial average weight = 12.5 g) fed on the abalone faeces and leftover feed, which settled at the abalone tank's bottom (sludge). There was a significant interaction between the type of culture and the frequency of cleaning on abalone weight (F ((1,476)) = 12.41, p < 0.001). Abalone in the A2 treatment group showed higher growth (p = 0.006) than those of the A1 treatment group, while abalone in AS1 had significantly higher growth (p < 0.001) than those in the AS2 treatment group. Also, abalone in AS1 showed higher growth (p = 0.026) than abalone in the A1 treatment. However, abalone in AS1 had growth similar (p = 0.53) to those in A2. The survival rate of the sea cucumbers was high, however, the sea cucumbers experienced a reduction in weight regardless of the treatment. This study showed that growth optimisation in abalone farming can be achieved by cleaning tanks twice instead of once weekly. However, when abalone are cocultured with sea cucumber, tanks need only be cleaned once a week without compromising abalone growth or water quality. The coculture of abalone and sea cucumber results in an additional aquacultured product, a significant reduction in labour and other associated costs of cleaning, without an additional cost of production.",10.1007/s10499-024-01508-1,"Vine, Niall/0000-0003-1649-6242; John, Abigail/0000-0003-1366-1118; Slater, Matthew James/0000-0001-8588-544X",0967-6120,1573-143X,,DEC,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-024-01508-1,

Settlement was very low on single species diatom films and varied between 1%-6%. Depending on the species combination larvae preferred to settle on films with mixed diatom species than single species films. The highest settlement was achieved with a mixed film of Navicula sp. and Amphora sp. Five and ten-day-old germlings of Sporolithon durum induced settlement of the abalone Haliotis rubra. However, the settlement rate was significantly lower on germlings than on the whole thallus of the alga. Germlings inoculated with the diatom Navicula sp. induced higher settlement than films of the diatom species alone. High settlement of up to 52% was also achieved with germlings of the green alga Ulvella lens. Settlement was reduced on U. lens squares inoculated with the diatom Navicula sp. but higher than on films of the diatom alone. The settlement rate was higher if plates with U. lens were previously grazed by juvenile abalone. Post-larval growth rates were higher on monospecific diatom films than on U. lens or on S. durum. The best growth rate was obtained with Navicula sp. U. lens and S. durum are both good settlement inducers, but are not sufficient to support rapid growth of young H. rubra post-larvae.

Abalone MT shares conserved structural features with previously known gastropod orthologs at both genomic (i.e., tripartite organization) and amino acid (conserved Cys motifs) levels. The 5'-flanking regulatory region of abalone MT gene displayed various transcription factor binding motifs particularly including ones related with metal regulation and stress immune responses. Tissue distribution and basal expression patterns of MT mRNAs indicated a (p)otential association between ovarian MT expression and sexual maturation. Developmental expression pattern suggested the maternal contribution of MT mRNAs to embryonic and early larval developments. Abalone MT mRNAs could be significantly induced by various heavy metals in different tissues (gill, hepatopancreas, muscle and hemocyte) in a tissue- and/or metal-dependent fashion. In addition, the abalone MT gene was highly modulated in responsive to other non-metal, stimulatory treatments such as immune challenge (LPS, polyI:C and bacterial injections), hypoxia (decrease from normoxia 8 ppm-2 ppm), thermal elevation (increase from 20 C to 30 C), and xenobiotic exposure (250 ppb of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol and 0.25 ppb of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin) where differential expression patterns were toward either up- or down-regulation depending on types of stimulations and tissues examined.

During the process, we expect that behavioural and physiological traits may evolve to become more adapted to their captive environment. These modifications may result from intentional selection of production traits or unconscious and unintentional selection due to conditions experienced in the farm environment. To study this process at the earliest stage, the progeny of 3 different broodstocks obtained from wild parents, selected farmed abalone and randomly sampled farmed abalone, were studied. After rearing for 16 mo in separate tanks, offspring from the 3 progenies were placed together in sea cages at the same density. After 3 yr, behavioural traits were studied, and the immune status after a stress situation was assessed. Mortality and growth were also recorded. In spite of the fact that no significant differences were observed in survival, growth or immune status traits between the 3 progenies, less progeny from the selected broodstock performed the complete sequence of anti-predation behaviour, and they took more time to reach their hides compared to the wild progeny. In addition, the shell colours of the selected progeny were more orange and had more stripes compared to the brown-green colour of the wild progeny. Progeny of randomly sampled broodstock showed intermediate responses between those of wild and selected progeny.

Eight experimental diets with graded levels of carbohydrates (18.08%, 22.10%, 26.10%, 29.90%, 34.00%, 38.01%, 41.98% and 45.55%, named as T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7 and T8, respectively) were designed to feed abalone (initial weight 22.52 +/- 0.05 g) for 110 days. The results showed that the diet containing 38.01% carbohydrate significantly increased the survival rate (SR) and weight gain rate (WGR) of abalone (P < 0.05). Based on the quadratic regression mode of WGR, the optimal dietary carbohydrate level for abalone was estimated to be 37.05%. The activities of intestinal digestive enzymes were significantly increased in the T6 group. Moreover, the expressions of pyruvate kinase (pk) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pdh) in digestive glands were up-regulated with the increase of carbohydrate content in diets, while the expression of hexokinase (hk) reached the maximum in the T6 group. The highest expressions of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pepck), glucose-6-phosphatase (g6pase) and insulin signaling pathway related genes were found in the T6 group. The expressions of key genes related to lipolysis reached the highest in the T6 group, and then down-regulated with the further increasing dietary carbohydrate levels. The expression of key genes of lipogenesis was up-regulated with the increasing dietary carbohydrate levels. In conclusion, 38.01% of dietary carbohydrate level improved the growth performance of abalone. Dietary carbohydrate levels influenced the glucose and lipid metabolism including insulin signaling pathway.

L. undosum did not discriminate among three kelp foods (Egregia menziesii, Eisenia arborea and Macrocystis pyrifera) but ate kelp preferentially and more rapidly over all but Ulva spp. among tested macrophytes. Secondary preferences were established for the red alga Pterocladiella capillacea, followed by the coralline Lithothrix aspergillum, whereas the brown seaweeds Zonaria farlowii and Halidrys dioica and the seagrass Phyllospadix torreyi were the least preferred macrophytes. Fastest consumption rates (1.91 g day(-1)) were measured in trials consisting only of kelp foods. These results indicate that L. undosum exhibits clear feeding preferences even when given less-preferred, non-kelp macrophytes. Using an ash-marker technique, we determined total organic, carbon, and nitrogen assimilation efficiencies (AE%) for six macroalgae used in preference trials. Tested macrophytes were assimilated at different efficiencies but a pattern was not detected between AE (%) and a macrophyte's position in L. undosum's preference hierarchy. Highest total organic AEs were found for P. capillacea (61.2%) and H. dioica (59.4%); lowest AEs were detected for E. menziesii (34.9%), a preferred dietary item. Nitrogen was assimilated from red algae with higher efficiencies (74.9-84.3%) than from brown or green algae. These data suggest that the digestive capabilities of L. undosum are better suited for assimilating organic material and nitrogen from less-preferred, non-kelp foods.

Juvenile abalone Haliotis discus hannai INO weighing 3.1-4.3 g in live weight (29-34 mm in shell length) were fed on one of the variety of the formulated test diets containing casein or white fishmeal as a protein source, and different levels of sodium alginate, lipid and a mineral mixture for 30 and 40 days, respectively. The growth rate and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) were compared with those obtained by feeding with live fronds of the alga Eisenia bicyclis as a control, which was known to have high dietary value for this herbivore. Dietary value of the casein diet was found to be comparable or superior to that of the alga. While feeding abalone on a white fishmeal diets resulted in a lower growth and FCE, being about 60% of those compared to the casein diets. These results clearly indicated that the casein diet used in this experiments was suitable as a semipurified test diet for abalone.

Pyrene can cause the immune disturbance and oxidative stress, result in immunotoxicity, DNA damage, reduce reproduction significantly, and induce behavioral changes. Marine bivalves are commonly used as bioindicators for marine pollution, and hemolymph is a metabolite transfer medium for PAH pollutant. However, the vital immune indicator responses of pearl oyster Pinctada martensii hemolymph exposed to pyrene is still unclear. Thus, the immunotoxic responses of pyrene on the hemolymph of the Pinctada martensii were investigated in this study. After exposure to pyrene for 7 days, the total number of hemocytes (THC), cell membrane stability (CMS), phagocytic activity (PA) and total glutathione (GSHT) all decreased significantly. Pyrene also caused a significant increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO). Median effective concentrations (EC50) of pyrene on THC (4.5 mu g L-1) and LPO (5.2 mu g L-1) were lower than those for CMS (13.8 mu g L-1), PA (12.1 mu g L-1) and GSHT (7.2 mu g L-1), which indicates that THC and LPO were more sensitive. Additionally, a clear dose-effect relationship indicated that pyrene stimulated a marked immune response, as well as oxidative stress in P. martensii, which demonstrates the subtle effects of pyrene exposure on marine invertebrates and the potential associated risk.

The present study characterized an initiator caspase (HrCas8) and an effector caspase (HrCas3) from the red abalone Haliotis rufescens using the RACE method and qPCR analysis. HrCas8 showed a complete sequence of 2529 base pairs (bp) with an open-reading frame (ORF) of 1911 bp, a 5'UTR of 201 bp, and a 3'UTR of 417 bp. The estimated molecular mass for the 636 amino acids from HrCas8 was 71.5 kDa with an isoelectric point of 6.2. The HrCas8 sequence had two death-effector domains (DEDs) and the subunits p20 and p10, in addition to an active site characteristic of cysteine proteins. Meanwhile, the effector caspase HrCas3 showed a complete sequence of 1404 bp, a 5'UTR of 82 bp, and a 3'UTR of 574 bp. The ORF of this caspase had 747 bp that coded for 248 residues. Moreover, the predicted molecular mass of HrCas3 was 29.4 kDa; the theoretical isoelectric point was 5.70, and the sequence evidenced a conserved caspase recruitment domain (CARD). The distribution of the caspases in distinct tissues revealed that HrCas8 was principally expressed in the hemolymph, while HrCas3 had a higher expression in the gills. A basal level of expression was found for both caspases in muscle tissue. The immune response of caspases in H. rufescens was evaluated through an injection of Vibrio anguillarum. The results showed an increase in the transcription of HrCas8 post-challenge, as well as an activation of HrCas3, which together suggest the initiation of apoptosis as a response to bacterial infection in H. rufescens.

The heat-resistant strains G. lemaneiformis are extensively cultivated in the northern and southern coasts of China, yet high temperature in the summertime in southern coasts has hindered the growth and limited the cultivated periods of this seaweed. A vast majority of reports have manifested that exogenous phytohormone brassinosteroids (BRs) can improve the plant heat-tolerance. However, little is known about the effect and its underlying mechanism of BRs in algae. In this study, the effect of 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) on the physiological and transcriptional levels was investigated in the high-temperature stressed G. lemaneiformis. Physiological data indicated that EBR application could improve the growth with 1.43-fold on day 5 and non-photochemical quenching parameter, reduce the productions of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), enhance the accumulations of proline, trehalose, and the levels of endogenous 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenine (2MeSiP), 2-methylthio-cis-zeatin riboside (2MeScZR), jasmonic acid (JA), N-[(-)-jasmonoyl]-(l)-phenylalanine (JA-Phe) and salicylic acid 2-O-beta-glucoside (SAG) under high-temperature condition. In addition, transcriptomic analysis identified 656 upregulated- and 680 downregulated-genes following the EBR treatment compared to the control group, revealed that EBR activated the metabolic pathways of the glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, and synthesis of threonine, methionine, and serine. Taken together, the aforementioned results highlighted the beneficial effect of EBR via alleviating the oxidative stress, promoting the accumulations of osmolytes and stress-related phytohormones, and activating the metabolisms of carbohydrate and amino acid, thereby resulting in the mitigating of growth inhibition by high-temperature stress in G. lemaneiformis.",10.1007/s00344-024-11454-0,,0721-7595,1435-8107,,2024 AUG 21,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-024-11454-0,

Currently, summer mortality caused by high temperature, is one of the biggest challenges for abalone aquaculture industry. The hybrid abalone (Haliotis discus hannai ? x H. fulgens ?) was conferred on the new variety . It has heterosis for thermal tolerance and has been cultured at large-scale in southern China. In this study, a transcriptome analysis was performed to identify the related genes in this hybrid abalone under thermal stress and recovery stage.

In this study, 24 degrees C is the critical temperature at which the abalone is subjected to thermal stress. With the temperature rising, the number of stress-responsive genes increased. During the temperature recovering to the optimum, the number of stress-responsive genes decreased gradually. Thus, this hybrid abalone has a rapid response and strong adaptability to the temperature. Under the thermal stress, the abalone triggered a complicated regulatory network including degrading the misfolded proteins, activating immune systems, negative regulation of DNA replication, and activating energy production processes. The more quickly feedback regulation, more abundant energy supply and more powerful immune system might be the underlying mechanisms to fight against thermal stress in this hybrid abalone. These findings could provide clues for exploring the thermal-response mechanisms in abalone.

The animals were fed one of the three experimental diets with 0.10, 1.31 and 4.20 mg kg(-1) of Se from Na2SeO3 center dot 5H(2)O respectively. Results showed that the abalone fed 1.31 mg kg(-1) of dietary Se had the lowest Cu concentration in shell, muscle, mantle, gill, hepatopancreas and serum. Meanwhile, the significant lowest contents of malondiadehyde and protein carbonyl in hepatopancreas were also found in the treatment with 1.31 mg kg(-1) of dietary Se (P < 0.05). In addition, this treatment had significant higher glutathione content and thioredoxin reductase activity in hepatopancreas (P < 0.05).

The effects of five species of macroalgae (Alaria esculenta, Laminaria digitata, Laminaria saccharina, Palmaria palmata and Ulva lactuca) on specific growth rates (SGR) of the abalone and, the relationship between abalone SGR and fatty acid profiles in the algae were investigated. The current study confirmed our previous findings. Based on SGR the dietary values of these macroalgae can be listed in a decreasing order as follows: P. palmata, A. esculenta, U. lactuca, L. digitata and L. saccharina for H. tuberculata and, A. esculenta, P. palmata, L. digitata, L. saccharina and LI. lactuca for H. discus hannai.

The red alga, P. palmata, was characterised by the highest proportion of 20:5n-3 among the selected algae. In the green alga, Li. lactuca, however, the dominant PUFA were C-16 and C-18 fatty acids, while C-20 fatty acids were minimal.

Although mixotrophy elevates the growth rate of T. helix by 79%-185%, its absolute growth rate is still as low as 0.3 d(-1). Thus, if the mortality rate of T. helix due to predation is high, this dinoflagellate may not easily prevail. To investigate potential effective protistan grazers on T helix, feeding by diverse heterotrophic dinoflagellates such as engulfment-feeding Oxyrrhis marina, Gyrodinium dominans, Gyrodinium moestrupii, Polykrikos kofoidii, and Noctiluca scintillans, peduncle feeding Aduncodinium glandula, Gyrodiniellum shiwhaense, Luciella masanensis, and Pfiesteria piscicida, pallium-feeding Oblea rotunda and Protoperidinium pellucidum, and the naked ciliates Pelagostrobilidium sp.

Among the tested heterotrophic protists, O. marina, G. dominans, G. moestrupii, A. glandula, L. masanensis, P. kofoidii, P. piscicida, and Strombidinopsis sp. were able to feed on T. helix. The growth rates of all these predators except Strombidinopsis sp. with T. helix prey were lower than those without the prey. The growth rate of Strombidinopsis sp. on T. helix was almost zero although the growth rate of Strombidinopsis sp. with T. helix prey was higher than those without the prey. Moreover, T. helix fed on O. marina and P. pellucidum and lysed the cells of P. kofoidii and G. shiwhaense. With increasing the concentrations of T. helix, the growth rates of O. marina and P. kofoidii decreased, but those of G. dominans and L. masanensis largely did not change. Therefore, reciprocal predation, lysis, no feeding, and the low ingestion rates of the common protists preying on T. helix may result in a low mortality rate due to predation, thereby compensating for this species' low growth rate.

In contrast, secondary shell openings are rare in snails and are largely limited to slit shells, keyhole limpets, and abalone of the Vetigastropoda. When such features occur in other groups, they are noteworthy and raise interesting questions concerning the functional/adaptive significance of these shell modifications. Here we report on one such modification in a newly described species of vermetid snail. Members of the worm-snail family Vermetidae are sessile, suspension-feeding caenogastropods found in warm temperate to tropical marine environments worldwide. As juveniles, vermetids permanently cement their shells to hard substrata and subsequently produce irregularly coiled polychaete-like shell tubes with indeterminate growth and typically a simple circular shell aperture. In one previously studied group (genus Cupolaconcha), the aperture can be covered by a shell dome with a central slit that retains its widest opening in the center of the aperture. Vermetid specimens collected in the barrier reefs of Belize and the Florida Keys show an extreme aperture modification previously unknown in Gastropoda, in which the shell opening is covered by an apertural dome that leaves two equal-sized circular holes, each corresponding to the inflow and outflow water exchange currents of the animal's mantle cavity. The function of this perforated apertural dome is unknown, and it is in some ways antithetical to the suspension feeding habit of these snails. Further field and laboratory-based studies will be needed to clarify the functional significance and trade-offs of this unique morphology. The new taxon, which is not closely related to the previously described dome-building Glade Cupolaconcha, is described and named as Vermetus biperforatus Bieler, Collins, Golding & Rawlings n. sp.",10.7717/peerj.6569,"Rawlings, Timothy A./0009-0001-5211-7214; Bieler, Rudiger/0000-0002-9554-1947",2167-8359,,,Feb-28,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.6569,

Juvenile snails (average weight, 32 +/- A 0.7 mg) were randomly distributed in forty-eight 25-L aquaria (16 L water each) in a flow-through system at a density of 130 snails per aquarium. Three replicate groups of snails were fed one of the experimental diets ad libitum once per day for 10 weeks. At the end of the feeding experiment, survival of snails was above 98% and not significantly different among the dietary treatments. The best final body weight was observed in snails fed the SBM and WF diets. There were no significant differences in final body weight of snails fed the F-SBM, WF, F-WF and MIX diets, but the value was higher than that of snails fed the FM, F-FM, FWP and F-FWP diets. The lowest value was observed in snails fed the SSM, F-SSM, SCR and F-SCR diets. Whole body protein and lipid contents of snails varied with dietary protein sources. Amino acid composition of whole body was altered by dietary protein sources. The results of the present study indicate that dietary protein sources significantly influence proximate and amino acid composition, and growth performance of snails. Fermentation with ferminpan instant brown yeast does not improve nutritional quality of the protein sources, and soybean meal and wheat flour in combination with fish meal could be potential protein sources in feeds for juvenile snails.",10.1007/s10499-009-9308-9,,0967-6120,,,AUG,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-009-9308-9,

Abalone were initially fed a nutritionally balanced formulated diet. Both PUFA and HUFA were low in the experimental formulated diets. After 60 days, growth rates of abalone fed the formulated diets were low and probably reflective of a lack of sufficient essential fatty acids. However, the total lipid content of the muscle tissue of abalone fed diets LL and HL remained unchanged from that of the start,of the experiment. However, the level in the starved abalone was significantly higher (21.5%) than that of abalone at the start of the experiment. The percentage of polar lipid and neutral lipid in the abalone muscle tissue ranged from 70.8% to 76.1% and 23.9% to 29.2%, respectively. Levels of 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3 and 22:5n-3 in the polar lipid of the muscle of the starved abalone significantly increased while levels of 20:4n-6 and 20:5n-3 in the neutral lipid for abalone in all treatments decreased, suggesting the essentiality of these HUFA. Levels of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 in the polar lipid of the tissue of the starved abalone were significantly higher than the levels of these respective fatty acids in the abalone fed diets HL and LL. These higher levels probably reflect the weight loss associated with starvation combined with lipid not being used as an energy source. More research directed toward the determination of the fatty acid requirements of postlarvae and for successful maturation and a spawning of abalone needs to be conducted. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Undaria is an important species for both the abalone industry and for commercial seaweed mariculture. In an attempt to extend the culture period of Undaria we bred and cultured hybrid kelp that is a cross between free-living gametophytes of U. peterseniana and Undariopsis pinnatifida. The morphological characteristics of the F-1 hybrid sporophytes were intermediate between those of the parent plants having shallow pinnated blades and forming both sorus and sporophyll. A F-2 generation was produced by isolating zoospores from sorus and sporophyll separately from a F-1 hybrid thallus. Using free-living gametophyte seeding and standard on-growing techniques, F-0 (female U. pinnatifida and male U. peterseniana), F-1, and F-2 gametophytes were cultured from December 2011 to May 2013. The morphological differences between the F-1 and F-2 generations were assessed. The F-2 hybrids were found to have longer pinnate blades and narrower midribs than the F-1 hybrid and only formed sporophylls. Growth and morphology of F-2 hybrids originating from the sporophyll or sorus of the F-1 hybrids were not morphologically different from each other. Both of the F-2 hybrids exhibited late maturation, with the early stages of sporophylls appearing in April.

Unlike other IGFBPs, there is no knowledge available on aquatic invertebrate IGFBP7. In this study, a molluscan IGFBP7 gene, saIGFBP7, was cloned for the first time from the small abalone Haliotis diversicolor. Its full-length cDNA sequence is 1812 bp, with a 720 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 239 aa. The molecular mass of the deduced protein is approximately 25.37 kDa with an estimated pl of 5.00, and it shares highest 41% identity to IGFBP7 of Amblyomma americanum. Analysis of conserved domains revealed the presence of an IGFBP N-terminal domain (IB), a kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor domain (KI), and an immunoglobulin-like C2 domain (IgC2) in saIGFBP7. Furthermore, the 12 cysteine residues and the signature amino acid motif 'xCGCCxxC' which are characterized by the amino terminus region of the IGFBP superfamily are all presented in saIGFBP7. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot were employed to investigate the tissue distribution of saIGFBP7, and its expression under bacterial challenge. The saIGFBP7 mRNA and protein could be detected in all examined tissues, with the highest expression level in hemocytes, higher expression level in gills, and was up-regulated in hemocytes and gills after bacterial injection. In addition, saIGFBP7 mRNA transcripts were observed in a subset of the branchial epithelium and the nucleus of hemocytes using the in situ hybridization method. Interestingly, saIGFBP7 was detected mainly in the goblet-like cell of the branchial epithelium by immunohistochemistry. These results suggested that saIGFBP7 was likely to be involved in a function associated with pathogenic infection and may play an important role in the adult abalone immune system.

In the present study, two MyD88 variants were identified from disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) and designated AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X. The deduced AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X comprised 433 and 354 amino acids with predicted molecular masses of 48.85 kDa and 40.17 kDa, respectively. AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X possessed typical MyD88 domain structural features including an N-terminal death domain (DD) and C-terminal toll interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain similar to those in mammals. Expression analysis of AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X mRNA at different early embryonic developmental stages of abalone by qPCR revealed that their constitutive expression at all developmental stages analyzed with the considerably higher values at the 16-cell (AbMyD88-2) and morula stages (AbMyD88-X). In unchallenged disk abalones, AbMyD88-2 was highly expressed in muscles, while AbMyD88-X mRNA was predominantly transcribed in hemocytes. Moreover, AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X mRNA were differentially modulated in abalone hemocytes after a challenge with live bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes), virus (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus), and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (lipopolysaccharides and Poly I:C). Overexpression of AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X in HEK293T cells induced the activation of the NF-kappa B promoter. AbMyD882 and AbMyD88-X involvement in inflammatory responses was characterized by their overexpression in RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells. These results revealed comparatively higher NO (Nitric oxide) production, induction of inflammatory mediator genes (iNOS and COX2), and proinflammatory genes (IL1 beta, IL6 and TNF alpha) expression in abalone MyD88s-overexpressing cells than in mock control in the presence or absence of LPS stimulation. Altogether, these results suggest that existence of a MyD88dependent like signaling pathway in disk abalone and that both AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X might be involved in innate immune and inflammatory responses. 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The gut-bacterial composition of Haliotis midae (5-9 mm) weaned onto either a commercial formulated feed (Abfeed-S34), fresh kelp (Ecklonia maxima), or a commercial formulated feed containing kelp (E. maxima) (Abfeed-S34K) was compared. The gut microbiota of postsettlement diatom-fed abalone was dominated by Planctomycetes. Weaning to kelp or formulated feed resulted in a significant difference in the gut-bacterial communities, with the Firmicutes becoming dominant in the kelp-fed treatment and the Proteobacteria dominating in the two formulated feed treatments (analysis of similarities: R = 0.77, P = 0.02). The gut microbiota of kelp-fed abalone displayed a relatively low diversity compared with that of abalone fed formulated feeds and was dominated by fermentative Clostridia bacteria. There was no difference in gut-bacterial communities of the abalone fed commercial formulated feed with or without kelp inclusion. The dominance of the Clostridia in the kelp-fed abalone guts is explained by the large volume of fermentable polysaccharides present in macroalgae, whereas the energy-rich formulated feeds appeared to reduce the selectivity of the gut environment resulting in a relatively higher bacterial diversity.",10.2983/035.037.0117,"Jones, Clifford/0000-0001-8394-1890; Britz, Peter/0000-0002-4436-0425; Nel, Aldi/0000-0002-5515-4600",0730-8000,1943-6319,,APR,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.037.0117,

Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that marine bivalves, including scallops, are vulnerable to OA due to their poor capacities to regulate extracellular ions and acid-based status. However, the physiological mechanisms of scallops responding to OA are not well understood. In this study, we evaluated the effects of 45 days of exposure to OA (pH 7.5) on the energy metabolism and antioxidant capability of Yesso scallops. Some biochemical markers related to energy metabolism (e.g., content of glycogen and ATP, activity of ATPase, lactate dehydrogenase, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase), antioxidant capacity (e.g., reactive oxygen species level, activity of superoxide dismutase, and catalase) and cellular damage (e.g., lipid peroxidation level) were measured. Our results demonstrate that the effects of the reduced pH (7.5) on scallops are varied in different tissues. The energy reserves are mainly accumulated in the adductor muscle and hepatopancreas. Yesso scallops exhibit energy modulation by increasing lactate dehydrogenase activities to stimulate anaerobic metabolism. The highly active Na+/K+-ATPase and massive ATP consumption in the mantle and gill indicate that a large amount of energy was allocated for the ion regulation process to maintain the acid-base balance in the reduced-pH environment. Moreover, the increase in the reactive oxygen species level and the superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in the gill and adductor muscle, indicate that oxidative stress was induced after long-term exposure to the reduced-pH environment. Our findings indicate that the effects of OA are tissue-specific, and physiological homeostasis could be modulated through different mechanisms for Yesso scallops.",10.3389/fphys.2018.01967,,1664-042X,,,Jan-21,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2018.01967,30719011

To facilitate the restoration of wild stocks of Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) and increase the success rate of release, abalones were monitored for 24 h without interruption in an experimental unit (developed in-house) to assess the flow velocity preferences of marine mollusks. Abalones tended to keep away from areas with higher flow velocities (> 5 cm/s) and they preferred to stay in areas with lower flow velocities (< 5 cm/s). Comparative study of the diurnal behavioral characteristics of abalones under seven different flow velocities (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 cm/s) showed that the cumulative distance moved, movement duration, and feeding time decreased significantly as the flow velocity increased. At flow velocities over 20 cm/s, abalones barely moved or consumed food, and cosine rhythm analysis demonstrated that the diurnal rhythms of behavioral parameters disappeared and the peak movement phase occurred earlier than expected. In addition, increasing the flow velocity reduced the spacing between individuals and the polarity of movement was higher. Individuals changed their coordination levels in groups as an active adaptation to changes in the flow velocity. These findings provide new insights into the ecological habits of abalones. Based on the characteristic movement behaviors of abalones at different flow velocities, bottom-sowing should be conducted in areas with a flow velocity < 5 cm/s instead of areas with a flow velocity > 20 cm/s to improve the efficiency of bottom-sowing stock enhancement.",10.1016/j.gecco.2024.e02823,,,2351-9894,,APR,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2024.e02823,

In this study, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were tested to detect nutritional sources during the early life stages of the abalone Haliotis discus hannai in laboratory experiments to evaluate stable isotope analyses as an appropriate investigative tool for field studies. Fertilized eggs, larvae, and the parent spawner muscle were analyzed to detect a nutritional source during the nonfeedine period. The delta C-13 of fertilized eggs showed slight depletion, about 2 parts per thousand, compared with that of the parent muscle, and was not detectable after lipid extraction of fertilized eggs. As for the larvae, the isotopic values in postlarvae after settlement and metamorphosis were 2 parts per thousand more enriched, become similar to that of the spawner muscle. These results imply that the lipid portion of the eggs is the primary nutritional source during the nonfeeding period of abalone. Laboratory feeding experiments were conducted during which early postlarval abalone (approximately 1 mm in shell length (SL)) were reared for 7 days and supplied with 4 benthic diatoms respectively. The benthic diatom Cylindrotheca closterium produced high growth and survival rates for early postlarval abalone, and there was a significant isotopic shift in their delta C-13, approaching that of C. closterium. Larger postlarval abalone (SL, >1.3 mm) were fed 1 of 5 benthic diatoms and a gametophyte of a macroalga, Undaria pinnatifida, for 21 days. Isotopic changes approaching. the delta C-13 of the provided benthic diatoms were detected from postlarvae fed the benthic diatoms Achnanthes longipes, Cocconeis scutellum, C. closterium, and the gametophyte of U. pinnatifida, which provided high survival rates and growth rates for the postlarvae. From these results, stable isotope ratios of postlarval abalone are suggested to be useful to infer the origin of the assimilated diets.

Abalones (initial weight: 10.98 +/- 0.05 g) were fed with graded levels of dietary lipid (1.57%, 2.34%, 3.17%, 3.82%, 4.63%, 5.56%, 6.17% and 6.72%). Results showed that weight gain rate (WGR) and increment in shell length of abalone were highest in 3.82% dietary lipid level. Based on the quadratic regression analysis for WGR, the optimal dietary lipid level for abalone was estimated to be 3.87%. Concentrations of the total triacylglycerol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-esterified fatty acids in serum as well as lipid contents in hepatopancreas and muscle were positively related to dietary lipid levels. Compared to the group with 3.82% of dietary lipid, higher (6.72%) and lower (1.57%) dietary lipid down regulated the expression of genes involved in fatty acids transport and lipolysis in hepatopancreas and muscle, which might be related to AMP-activated protein kinase alpha 2 (AMPK alpha 2)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) signaling. Higher dietary lipid (6.72%) down regulated, while lower dietary lipid (1.57%) up-regulated the expressions of genes involved in de-novo lipogenesis in hepatopancreas. Both higher (6.72%) and lower (1.57%) dietary lipid down regulated these genes' expression in muscle.

Here, we studied the effects of dietary protein/lipid ratios on the growth and folate metabolism of juvenile clam Sinonovacula constricta. Four microcapsule feeds were formulated with different protein (27-48 %) and lipid (2-14 %) levels, designated as follows: P48L2 (48 % protein and 2 % lipid), P41L6, P34L10, and P27L14 groups. Clams, initially measuring 2.7 +/- 0.08 mm in shell length, were fed these diets for a period of 14 days. Results showed the optimal dietary protein/lipid ratio for juvenile clams was predicted to be 4.6. The lipid level of clam exhibited an upward trend as the dietary protein/lipid ratio decreased, and the appropriate protein/lipid ratio enhanced the activities of amylase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. Transcriptome analysis showed that the pyrimidine/purine metabolism and one carbon pool by folate in the clam fed P41L6 diet was downregulated relative to those fed P34L10 and P27L14 diets. Meanwhile, compared with P34L10 group, the clam in the P41L6 group exhibited decreased levels of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and folate, and increased levels of L-methionine and S-adenosylmethionine. Our results for the first time revealed that the optimal dietary protein/lipid ratio for clam was 4.6. Furthermore, the high-protein/low-lipid diet may inhibit growth by causing abnormal accumulation of metabolites in the methionine cycle and inhibiting the folate metabolism, ultimately resulting in reduced purine and pyrimidine synthesis.

Thioredoxin acts as an active regulatory enzyme to eliminate excessive reactive oxygen species, thereby preventing cellular damage. In this study, the cDNA sequence of thioredoxin domain-containing 5 (AbTXNDC5) from the disk abalone transcriptomic database was characterized. An in silico analysis of AbTXNDC5 was performed, and its spatial and temporal expression patterns in hemocytes and gills in response to bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes), viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, and pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules were observed. Furthermore, AbTXNDC5 expression was examined in different developmental stages. Functional assays to explore insulin disulfide reduction, antiapoptotic activity, and protection against hypoxic cell death of AbTXNDC5 were conducted through recombinant proteins or overexpression in cells. AbTXNDC5 contains a 1179-bp open reading frame coding for 392 amino acids. Conserved thiol-disulfide cysteine residues within two Cys-X-X-Cys motifs were found in AbTXNDC5. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction indicated that healthy digestive tract and hemocyte tissues expressed high levels of AbTXNDC5 mRNA, which may protect the host from invading pathogens. Immune challenged abalone hemocytes and gills exhibited upregulated expression of AbTXNDC5 at different time points. rAbTXNDC5 also exhibited a functional insulin disulfide reductase activity.

A novel haplosporidian was associated with high mortalities (82.5-90%) of cultured juvenile paua (Haliotis iris) in New Zealand. Disease outbreaks among cultured abalone in Tasmania, Australia were associated with two species of Vibrio (V. harveyi and V. splendidus I) and a Flavobacterium-like bacterium with stress factors precipitating the diseases in most cases. The agent of withering syndrome responsible for mass mortalities of black abalone (H. cracherodii) in southern California was identified as the Rickettsiales-like prokaryote Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis. The exotic sabellid polychaete that seriously impacted abalone culture in California was named Terebrasabella heterouncinata and experimentally found to reproduce at low temperatures but with a significantly temperature-dependant generation time (a developmental cycle of 298 days at 11.2degreesC in comparison to 165 days at 15.6degreesC). To assess the health of cultured abalone, histologic examinations are essential. For histology, tissue samples (less than 1 cm thick) should be fixed in Davidson's solution or 10% formalin in seawater such that there is at least 10 parts fixative to 1 part tissue. Histopathology will not only indicate the presence of infectious agents but can be useful for monitoring the suitability of the diet and aquaculture environment. These assessments will benefit abalone aquaculture and provide assurance that only healthy animals are used in stock rehabilitation programs.",,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,DEC,,

The antioxidant enzymes include Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), catalase (CAT), mu-glutathione-s-transferase (mu-GST) and thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx). The results showed that the mRNA expression of these antioxidant enzymes increased and reached the maximum at the dietary zinc level of 33.8 mg/kg, and then dropped progressively.

Relative amounts of individual saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were similar in eggs of both wild caught and conditioned broodstock. The relative proportions of some polyunsaturated fatty acids of the broodstock diets were reflected in the eggs and varied between batches of conditioned and wild broodstock. Formulated feed has high linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and the proportion of this fatty acid was 10 times higher in eggs spawned from animals fed formulated feed than in eggs of wild caught broodstock. Eggs derived from wild broodstock, which feed preferentially on red seaweeds, showed about twice as much arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) compared with eggs from conditioned broodstock, which were supplied with a formulated diet low in arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is a major precursor of prostaglandins, which play a vital role in molluscan reproduction. In this study, the levels of ARA were higher in eggs than in the respective diets of the broodstock, except of the Gracilaria diet, indicating that ARA was preferentially incorporated into the eggs of broodstock feeding on formulated feed and Ulva australis.

In order to determine physiological response of A. purpuratus under different salinities and temperature conditions, two groups of juvenile scallops (small: h=6.5 mm and large: h=25.5 mm) were acclimated and close-cultured at salinities of 34, 38, and 42 g/l, at 16 and 22 degrees C and fed on Isochrysis galbana and Chaetoceros calcitrans. Survival, shell growth and scope for growth were determined at the end of the trials. Survival showed an inverse relationship with temperature and ammonia levels. In small scallops an increase in salinity at 16 degrees C increased survival. However, this relationship was not evident at 22 degrees C. On the other hand, salinity did not affect survival of large juveniles. Small juveniles had a lower survival (approximately 40%) than larger scallops (up to 85%) throughout the trials. Oxygen consumption was not affected by salinity. Small scallops showed similar oxygen consumption at 16 and 22 degrees C but in large juveniles higher values were registered at 22 degrees C. In large juveniles routine consumption at 16 degrees C was higher (up to 35%) than standard consumption. This pattern was not evident at 22 degrees C, suggesting that oxygen demand is higher regardless of feeding condition. NH4+-N excretion rate is inversely related to salinity. Only small juveniles showed a higher NH4+-N excretion rate at 22 degrees C. Scope for growth was positive in all treatments, although the upper limit of salinity should not be based only in this index. Higher scope for growth values at 38 and 42 g/l was related with a reduction in ammonia excretion and high absorption efficiency. In addition, an increase in salinity produced a reduction in NH3-N proportion and under hypersaline conditions scallops tended to decrease excretion as a way of osmoconformation. This explains our findings of higher survival rates at higher salinities. Even though the scope for growth is positive at 42 g/l, the osmotic stress reduces the survival chances. The data obtained can be considered useful information for A. purpuratus culture under controlled conditions. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The experimental diets containing graded levels of dietary iron (24.9-212.7 mg iron/kg) provided as either FeMet or FeSO4 were fed to juvenile abalone. Abalone juveniles of similar size were distributed in a flow-through system using a completely randomized design with thirteen treatments and three replicates of each treatment. Abalone fed the basal diet without iron supplementation exhibited significantly lower survival and carcass protein than the other groups. The average weight gain rate (WGR, %). daily increment in shell length (DISL, mum/day), and soft-body iron concentration (SB iron. mug/g) of the abalone were significantly affected by dietary treatment, and responded in broken-lint models to increases in dietary iron levels from the two iron sources. The optimal levels of dietary iron using FeMet and FeSO4 as the supplemental iron sources, determined by broken-line regression analysis, on the basis of maximum WGR, were 62.79 and 58.35 mg/kg, respectively. On maximum DISL, the values were 66.12 and 62.11 mg/kg, respectively, and on maximum SE iron deposition were 66.78 and 64.55 mg/kg, respectively. The content of iron and manganese in the shell, however, was maintained relatively constant regardless of dietary treatment. Significantly reduced manganese deposition in soft-body parts was observed for the abalone Fed diets containing high levels (greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg) of iron From FeSO4. However, this effect of excess iron on the utilization of manganese was not found when using FeMet as the iron source. Based on these results, an optimal level of dietary iron was recommended to be 65-70 mg/kg with either FeMet or FeSO4 as the iron source. This experiment also showed that the bioavailability of dietary iron from FeSO4 was as high as that from FeMet.",,,0730-8000,,,DEC,,

Nine experimental diets in a 3 & times; 3 two-factor design were formulated with different carbohydrate levels (27.5%, 32% and 36.5%) and vitamin D3 levels (0, 1000 IU/kg and 5000 IU/kg). Results showed that the highest specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone was observed in the treatment with 36.5% of dietary carbohydrate and 1000 IU/kg of vitamin D3. The serum glucose, body crude lipid and muscle glycogen contents of abalone significantly increased with increasing dietary carbohydrate levels (P < 0.05). Diet with 1000 IU/kg of vitamin D3 significantly reduced the serum glucose and body crude lipid content (P < 0.05). Significant interactions between dietary carbohydrate and vitamin D3 were observed in SGR and crude lipid content (P < 0.05). Diet with 36.5% carbohydrate up-regulated the expression of pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate (IRS), protein kinase B (Akt), glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase (PYG), whereas decreased the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6P) and glycogen synthesis kinase-3 beta. Diet with 1000 IU/kg of vitamin D3 significantly up-regulated the hexokinase, IR, IRS, Akt and glucose transporter 1 mRNA levels, whereas decreased the G6PDH (P < 0.05). The interaction between dietary carbohydrate and vitamin D3 were significant on PEPCK, G6P, G6PDH and PYG mRNA levels (P < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary carbohydrates and vitamin D3 could affect glucose metabolism by regulating glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and pentose phosphate pathway in abalone.

Two strains (Achnanthes longipes-l and Nitzschia sp.) produced significantly faster growth (means 34-35 mu m shell length per day) than the remaining six strains (means 11-17 mu m/day). The two fast-growth strains were efficiently digested by post-larvae, with 93-94% of live cells ruptured during passage through the gut. Two of the remaining strains could not be ingested during the growth experiment because the cells were too large (A. longipes-2) or too strongly attached (Cocconeis pseudomarginata). For the other four strains (Navicula britannica, Nav. ramosissima, Navicula sp. and Nitzschia ovalis) most cells passed through the gut alive. Survival rate was highest on the two fast-growth strains, and survival was positively correlated with both growth rate (r = 0.73, P < 0.05) and digestion efficiency (r= 0.80, P < 0.05) of diatoms. The digestion efficiency of diatom strains appears to be an important factor determining their dietary value. Digestion efficiency can be influenced by diatom morphology, attachment strength, frustule strength and post-larval age/size.

The ability to optimize energy acquisition to this episodic thermal oscillation may determine the survival, growth and development of these ectotherms. We compared the physiological and molecular responses of Haliotis discus hannai cultivated in suspended cages to fluctuating or stable temperature conditions. Several physiological indicators (respiration, excretion rates and O:N) were measured in both conditions, and alterations in the proteome during thermal fluctuations were assessed. No summer mortality was observed in abalone cultivated in fluctuating temperatures compared with that at stable high temperatures. Metabolic rates increased sharply during stable warm summer conditions and fluctuated in accordance with short-term temperature fluctuations (20-26 degrees C). Ammonia excretion rates during acute responses were comparable in both conditions. When abalone were exposed to fluctuating temperatures, enzyme activities were downregulated and structure-related protein expression was upregulated compared with that at an acclimation temperature (26 degrees C), highlighting that exposure to low temperatures during fluctuations alters molecular processes.

Changes in messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of melatonin receptor (MT-R), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and antioxidant enzymes, as well as alterations in H2O2 levels in the hemolymph, were examined. The results revealed that high-temperature-stressed abalones treated with melatonin injections or exposed to red LED light showed a significant increase in MT-R mRNA expression, while HSP70 mRNA expression decreased. Notably, HSP70 mRNA expression levels in the red LED light-irradiated group were similar to those in the group injected with 10(-8 )M melatonin after 24 h exposure. Abalones treated with melatonin at 20 degrees C or irradiated with red LED light exhibited decreased H2O2 levels and reduced antioxidant enzyme mRNA expression compared with those of the control group.

Moreover, abalones exposed to high-temperature stress exhibited hepatopancreatic DNA damage, which was attenuated by melatonin treatment or red LED light irradiation. Hence, red LED light reduces oxidative stress, boosts antioxidant enzymes, and alleviates DNA damage in high-temperature-stressed abalones, akin to 10(-8 )M melatonin treatment.

The aim of this study was the understanding of a possible role of the p38 MAPK in abalone haemocyte responses towards this bacterium. First, the pathogenicity of different V. harveyi strains was compared in both immersion and injection trials, and clear differences were detected. The three strains, ORM4, 04/092, and 05/053, all isolated front moribund abalone, induced up to 80% mortalities in immersion or injection challenges (LD50 (ORM4) = 2.5 x 10(2) CFU animal(-1)). The two strains, LMG 4044T and LMG 7890 were non-pathogenic towards abalone in immersion trials, and needed very high numbers for killing by intramuscular injections (LD50 = 8.9 x 10(4) and 1.6 x 10(5) CFU animal(-1), respectively). To start unraveling the mechanism explaining these differences, the p38-MAPK, a keyplayer in antimicrobial immune response, was studied. The non-pathogenic strain, LMG 7890 can be eliminated by abalone haemocytes and induces haemocyte phagocytosis and high ROS production. With different concentrations of a p38-specific inhibitor, SB203580, p38 implication was shown. This inhibitor reduced phagocytosis and ROS induction leading to LMG 7890 proliferation. In the case of the pathogenic ORM4 which can not be eliminated by abalone haemocytes, no phagocytosis and ROS production was induced, and a retarded p38 activation was observed. Taken together, our results suggest that p38 MAPK modulation may be one of the ways of virulent V. harveyi to attack its host and escape abalone immune response. J. Cell. Biochem. 106: 152-160, 2009.

Proteinase inhibitors play a key role in regulating the activity of the respective proteinases. Among serine proteinase inhibitors, kazal-type proteinase inhibitors (KPIs) are widely found in mammals, avians, and a variety of invertebrates. In this study, we describe the identification of a kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor (Ab-KPI) from the disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus, which is presumably involved in innate immunity. The full-length cDNA of Ab-KPI includes 600 bp nucleotides with an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 143 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of Ab-KPI contains a putative 17-amino acid signal peptide and two tandem kazal domains with high similarity to other kazal-type SPIs. Each kazal domain consists of reactive site (P-1) residue containing a leucine (L), and a threonine (T) located in the second amino acid position after the second conserved cysteine of each domain. Temporal expression of Ab-KPI was assessed by real time quantitative PCR in hemocytes and mantle tissue following bacterial and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) challenge, and tissue injury. At 6 h post-bacterial and -VHSV challenge, Ab-KPI expression in hemocytes was increased 14-fold and 4-fold, respectively, compared to control samples. The highest up-regulations upon tissue injury were shown at 9 h and 12 h in hemocytes and mantle, respectively. The transcriptional modulation of Ab-KPI following bacterial and viral challenges and tissue injury indicates that it might be involved in immune defense as well as wound healing process in abalone.

Larvae of the abalone Haliotis discus hannai were offered, in a petri dish, a choice of several food patches, each made of a diatom monoculture layer. The distribution of the larval settlement on the patches of 17 diatom species was determined. Nitzschia laevis induced the most abalone larvae settlement, followed by Navicula cf lenzii and Amphora luciae. The attractiveness of these diatoms for abalone larvae settlement was not directly related to algal biochemical composition or algal color. It is suggested that compounds excreted by algal cells determine their inductive properties for larval settlement. The larval chemosensory response depends on the concentration of these inductive substances. Sonicated diatom cell suspensions strongly induced larvae attachment, whereas dilute suspensions did not. Boiling settlement-inductive sonicated diatom cell suspensions did not affect their induction ability, implying that native proteins are not essential for the response. Aspartic acid was the only free amino acid excreted by two tested diatoms. It was also the only pure amino acid found inductive for larval settlement. It is therefore suggested that aspartic acid is a component of the settlement induction complex.",,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,AUG,,

It is vital in aquaculture by bringing beneficial traits into hybrids. People have utilized the heterosis theory in aquaculture for years. However, the molecular basis of heterosis remains elusive. Evident growth and survival heterosis were shown in the hybrid (Dongyou-1) of two Haliotis diversicolor geographic genotypes (Japan and Taiwan). To explore the molecular basis underlying the hybrid abalone's heterosis, we conducted comparative mRNA and miRNA transcriptional analysis in the hybrid and parental genotypes. Differentially expression analysis identified 5,562 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 102 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) between the three genotypes. 1,789 DEGs and 71 DEMs were found to be non-additively expressed in the hybrid. Meanwhile, both the expression level dominance pattern (ELD) and expression level overdominance pattern (ELOD) were found in the DEGs and DEMs, showing the existence of dominance and overdominance models in the hybrid's transcriptome and post-transcriptional regulation. Functional analysis showed the non-additively expressed genes, ELD genes, and ELOD genes were significantly enriched in growth, immunity, and stress response related pathways, while some of the pathways were regulated by the mRNA-miRNA interactions. The expression levels of FGF, C1Q, HC, CAT, SEGPX, and MGST were significantly up-regulated in the hybrid compared to the middle parent value. In conclusion, we identified the existence of non-additivity, dominance, and overdominance models in the transcriptome and miRNAome of the H. diversicolor hybrid; these models facilitate the advantageous parental alleles' integration into the hybrid, contributing to the hybrid's growth and survival heterosis.",10.3389/fmars.2021.667636,,,2296-7745,,Jun-04,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.667636,

However, nothing is known about gene expression of triploid abalone to modulate physiological responses under different environmental stresses. Transcriptomic response to the acute heat-stress and hypoxia were explored in hepatopancreas of diploid and triploid Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) juveniles. A total of 316 million clean reads were de novo assembled into 271,039 contigs, of which a transcriptome with 209,974 non-redundant transcripts was produced. Using generalized fold change (GFOLD) algorithm with a cut-off |GFOLD value| > 4, we identified differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) from diploid and triploid abalone in responses to acute heat-stress and hypoxia treatments, respectively. Comparative analysis of the identified DETs revealed alteration of transcript expression profile, level, and process in triploid abalone compared to their diploid siblings.

Results showed that the relative growth rate of G. lemaneiformis decreased while the principal economical metabolites, including agar, polysaccharides were accumulated significantly under blue light. To further understand the response mechanism of G. lemaneiformis to blue light, the omics analysis was used, which revealed that blue light redirected metabolic pathways toward the synthesis of diverse primary and secondary metabolic products, divided into four categories, including photosynthesis, antioxidant system, energy metabolism and carbohydrate synthesis. Among them, the genes encoding photosynthetic pigments and phycobiliproteins increased significantly, but the carbon fixation pathway, the ASA-GSH cycle, and TCA cycle were down-regulated, and more carbon flowed into the synthesis pathway of agar and polysaccharides, which were consistent with the changes of physiological parameters.

Significant survival heterosis in summer were observed in hybrids between two phylogenetically closely-related oysters, Crassostrea gigas and C. angulata, but an explicit understanding of hetemsis has been lacking. Here, we investigated the survival performance, oxygen consumption rate (OR) and enzyme activity (i.e., SOD, CAT and MDA) in C. gigas (GG), C. angulata (AA) and their hybrids C. gigas female x C. angulata male (GA) and C. angulata female x C. gigas male (AG) under acute heat stress containing five levels: 22, 26, 30, 34 and 38 degrees C. Compared with parental strains, the hybrid strains exhibited higher cumulative survival rate at all temperatures, indicating hetemsis for thermal tolerance. Cox regression analysis showed that hybrid strains challenged with heat shock exhibited lower hazard ratio and longer expected lifetime. Moreover, OR in hybrid strains were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those in parental strains under 34 and 38 degrees C. Arrhenius break-point temperature (ABT) and temperature coefficient (Q/O) revealed that hybrids had broader temperature range of aerobic metabolism and lower sensitivity to rising temperature. In addition, the activities of SOD and CAT of hybrid strains were significantly higher than the parental strains at 34 and 38 degrees C-level treatment after 6 h and at 34 degrees C-level treatment after 3 h, whereas the MDA content were reduced, indicating their stronger antioxidant capacity.

Three different temperatures (12, 16 and 20 degrees C) were chosen to measure the effect of fatty acid accumulation or synthesis compared to the control diet. After 200 days of experimentation, abalone exhibited different growth between each temperature, whereas no differences were observed between diets. However, a higher fatty acid accumulation was observed in muscle tissue at 12 degrees C. The relative amount of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) in the muscle tissue was similar between those individuals fed with the restriction (LC-PUFA free) and full diets. This was clearly observed within the LC-PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), but not with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), suggesting that H. tuberculata is able to synthesize the former FAs from their precursors. This pattern was also observed with arachidonic acid (ARA). In general abalone is able to synthesize and accumulate the necessary fatty acids to sustain growth at a wide range of temperatures and dietary sources, especially at lower temperatures, that could mean that this species is able to cope with a broad range of environmental conditions. However, DHA requirement in the H. tuberculata seems to be much inferior than previously reported, and its biosynthesis is undetectable under the present experimental conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.

Consequently, it is becoming increasingly important to characterise the abalone immune system in order to better understand their ability to combat infection. This study reports the identification and characterisation of a perforin-like protein, designated hmMpeg1, which is believed to be involved in the H. midae immune system. hmMpeg1 encodes for a 78 kDa protein that has significant sequence similarity to Mpeg proteins from other abalone species and includes the conserved cytolytic membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain of perforin. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis demonstrated expression of hmMpeg1 mRNA in haemocytes and epipodia samples from H. midae exposed to a heat-killed, Gram-negative bacterial pathogen, Vibrio anguillarum 5676. hmMpeg1 mRNA in haemocytes increased significantly 48 h post-infection (h.p.i) (8.2 fold; P < 0.05), coinciding with a decrease in the total number of circulating haemocytes, and reached a maximum at 96 h.p.i (17.2 fold; P < 0.05).

In order to investigate this further, the objective of this study was to localise the bacterial probiont Vibrio midae SY9 and one of the extracellular proteases it produces in the digestive tract of the South African abalone Haliotis midae.

In situ histological comparison of abalone fed either a basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with V. midae SY9::Tn10.52 using a cocktail of DNA probes to the gfp gene localised the probiont to the crop/stomach and intestinal regions of the H. midae digestive tract. Generally, the ingested probiotic bacterium occurred in association with feed and particulate matter within the crop/stomach and intestinal regions, as well as adhered to the wall of the crop/stomach. Histological immunohistochemical examination using polyclonal anti-VmproA antibodies localised an extracellular protease produced by V. midae SY9 to the H. midae crop/stomach and intestine where it appeared to be associated with feed and/or other particulate matter in the abalone gut. Thus the data suggests that V. midae SY9 colonises and/or adheres to the mucous lining of the abalone gut.

This infection, caused by the rickettsial-like intracellular organism (RIO) Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis, can severely impair the normal development of affected animals, and ultimately, their survival. The most common line of action against the WS has been the use of antibiotics, specifically oxytetracycline (OTC), administered via intramuscular injection and per os via medicated feed. In the present study, we have assessed the effectiveness of OTC baths as therapeutic treatment for the control of the WS agent in H. rufescens. Clinical signs of infection were monitored for 11 months in treated juveniles, in addition to feed consumption rate, growth patterns and gonad development. Abalones were asymptomatic until the end of the experiment, when a small number of non-treated animals exhibited clinical signs of infection. Gonad maturity was not observed. OTC treated animals grew significantly less than their non-treated counterparts, being 4.3% shorter and 13.6% lighter at the end of the experiment. They also displayed negative allometry, i.e. for the same shell length, they were lighter than non-treated groups. Furthermore, the weight of muscle and soft tissues in OTC treated animals was lighter than in the other groups, while no differences were found in shell weight. The feed consumption rate was the same for all groups, thus the observed growth patterns cannot be attributed to a decreased feed intake. One possible explanation is that antibiotic treatment may have impacted gut microflora, thus preventing efficient nutrient digestion and absorption and, indirectly, reducing growth. Prevalence of RLOs causing WS (WS-RLO) and the variant form (RLOv), infected with a bacteriophague and non virulent, were significantly lower in the OTC-treated group than in the other groups. Similar results were observed for the mean intensity of RLOv, while for WS-RLO, the intensity in the OTC-treated group was higher, although not statistically significant, than the rest of the groups. These observations may be the consequence of an increased bacterial sensitivity to OTC effects associated with the phage infection or faster reproduction of WS-RLOs than RLOv after OTC treatment. Our results let us infer that the prophylactic use of OTC in abalone to avoid the negative effects of WS on abalone farms could have an undesired negative effect on the biological control exerted by the phage on the bacteria after OTC treatment.",10.1016/j.jip.2018.02.019,,0022-2011,1096-0805,,MAR,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2018.02.019,29501500

We have identified Se-GPx full length cDNA from disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) designated as AbSe-GPx. It has a characteristic codon at (223)TGA(225) that corresponds to selenocysteine (Sec) amino acid as U-75. The full length cDNA consists of 675 bp, an open reading frame encoding 225 amino acids. Sequence characterization revealed that AbSe-GPx contains a characteristic GPx signature motif 2 ((97)LGFPCNQF(104)), an active site motif ((WNFEKF188)-W-183) and essential residues for the enzymatic function. Additionally, the eukaryotic selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) is conserved in the 3' UTR. The AbSe-GPx amino acid sequence exhibited the highest level of identity (46%) with insect (Ixodes scapularis) GPx, and shares 41% with bivalve (Unio tumidus) Se-GPx. The RT-PCR analysis revealed that AbSe-GPx mRNA was expressed constitutively in gill, mantle, gonad, abductor muscle, digestive tract, and hemocytes in a tissue specific manner. AbSe-GPx mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated in gill and digestive tract tissues after H2O2 injection and Vibrio alginolyticus infection. However, AbSe-GPx expression was not up-regulated after Aroclor 1254 injection. These results indicate that AbSe-GPx mRNA is expressed at a basal level in abalone tissues, which can be up-regulated transcriptionally by H2O2 oxidative stress and Vibrio alginolyticus infection. Therefore, AbSe-GPx may be involved in a protective role against H2O2 oxidative stress and immune defence against bacterial. infection.

Land-based abalone aquaculture mainly uses commercial feeds (CFs) to promote faster growth, which include FM as a primary protein component. Alternative ingredients, such as insect meal (IM) and grape marc (GM) are potential candidates for FM replacement due to their suitable nutritional profile and sustainable production. This paper reports on a novel nutritional approach for the New Zealand farmed abalone, which replaces FM with IM by 10% and includes a waste by-product (GM) by 30% as a potential prebiotic source. The study was performed in two stages: (a) physico-chemical determination of diets delivered in an alginate matrix (experimental diets) and their stability in seawater compared to CF and (b) evaluation of growth and feed intake for the New Zealand black-foot abalone. There were significant differences between experimental diets and CF in terms of sinking rate, particle weight, and microscopic observations. Water stability of the experimental diets was increased by 50% in 24 and 48 hr compared to CF, producing less solid waste, and potentially reducing cleaning efforts in the farm. The inclusion of IM and GM did not compromise overall animal growth or their feed conversion ratio, however, further evaluation need to be explored in the future research. The findings revealed that the developed encapsulated feeds are a more stable food delivery method for Haliotis iris compared to the CF. Furthermore, both IM and GM can be included in feed formulations as a more sustainable strategy without compromising weight and shell gains in the abalone farming.",10.1155/2023/8887768,"Bullon, Natalia/0000-0003-1284-6700",1353-5773,1365-2095,,Oct-11,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2023/8887768,37885797

Three iron concentrations (0.15, 1.5 and 15mgL-1 of Fe) and a control (no iron added) were used to culture H. rufescens postlarvae while being fed the diatom Navicula inserta over 10days. Results indicate that H. rufescens postlarvae accumulate iron granules in the stomach, digestive gland and mantle, but not in the gills or other tissues. The number and diameter of iron granules in tissues increased with increasing iron concentration in the culturing environment. The iron accumulation is assumed to have been acquired in the digestive system through the iron-enriched diatom feed and in the mantle through subcutaneous iron transfer. The lack of iron granules in the gills suggests that iron is not absorbed through the respiratory system, as is the case for many filter feeding bivalves. Exposure to the highest iron concentration (15mgL-1) resulted in tissue abnormalities where granules accumulated, and may have significantly affected the health of H. rufescens postlarvae.

Survival of OTC-injected red and black abalone was significantly higher than that of sham-treated animals (p<0.001 and p=0.036, respectively). Microscopic examination revealed that these animals died from WS and that tissue damage was beyond the ability of the animals to repair. Feeding rates of treated abalone were also significantly higher than for sham-treated control animals (p<0.001 for black abalone and p<0.0001 for red abalone). Oral administration (oxytetracycline medicated feed for 14 consecutive days) also effectively controlled WS in both pilot and production scale applications. The treatment caused significant and persistent long-term reductions in the intensity of bacterial infection as well as in the degree of morphological changes in the digestive gland (p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively).

On a commercial scale, a dry floating feed containing 2.6% OTC was found to be just as effective. Withering syndrome caused heavy (41%) mortality in control production tanks, but treated tanks experienced only 9% mortality (p<0.001). Treated tanks produced 56% more market sized abalone than control tanks (p<0.001), and larger abalones were harvested from treated than control tanks.

The present study examined the effects of dietary tryptophan on fitness-related behaviors under two common handling stresses (seawater washing and air exposure) in sea cucumber aquaculture. We found that sea cucumbers that consumed a diet with 3% dietary tryptophan demonstrated significantly enhanced crawling ability, adhesion index, food choice, and feeding ability compared to those fed with diets containing 0%, 1%, or 5% tryptophan after seawater washing. Adding 3% tryptophan to the diet effectively reduces the negative impacts of seawater washing on sea cucumbers. Similarly, sea cucumbers whose diets were supplemented with fed with 3% dietary tryptophan showed significantly better crawling and feeding behaviors after air exposure, suggesting that tryptophan effectively reduces the negative effects of this stress. However, there were no significant difference in righting response time, adhesion index, and food choice among sea cucumbers fed different levels of tryptophan after air exposure. The present study suggests aqua-farmers incorporate 3% dietary tryptophan into sea cucumber feed to minimize the behavioral harms caused by handling stresses.",10.1007/s10499-024-01579-0,,0967-6120,1573-143X,,DEC,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-024-01579-0,

Moreover, nuclear power plants (NPPs) also release excess thermal energy into the environment, contributing to rising seawater temperatures and exacerbating this threat. However, studies on the potential negative impacts of thermal pollution on mariculture are scarce, especially in field environments. Herein, a comparative investigation of hybrid abalone (Haliotis discus hannai female x Haliotis fulgens male) under thermal stress was performed in laboratory and field to evaluate the potential ecological risks of NPP thermal discharge. The survival rate, behavioral changes, antioxidant enzyme activity, and transcriptional profiles of antioxidant-relevant genes were determined in hybrid abalones under thermal stress. Under a natural water temperature of 29 degrees C, an increase of 4 degrees C led to the death of all abalones. In the field study, a temperature increase of 2 degrees C resulted in the partial death of these abalones and a decrease in their adhesion capacity, which did not occur in laboratory. In addition, thermal stress caused considerable changes in the antioxidant enzyme activity in these abalones, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase, and malondialdehyde content. Moreover, transcriptional levels of sod, cat, and heat shock protein 70 genes were substantially induced in laboratory and field studies. The integrated biomarker responses version 2 (IBRv2) method was used to comprehensively assess the effects of thermal discharge on the abalones. The relationship between the IBRv2 values and thermal stress is not linear.

Because of this feeding preference, thr structure of the digestive tract of H. laevigata was investigated using histological and scanning electron microscopy (SEM?) techniques. The digestive tract of both starved and fed adult H. laevigata revealed the presence of ciliated, mucus, and secretory cells throughout the digestive tract. The esophagus contained secretory, ciliated, and large mucous cells, with fragmentation spherules also present. The crop extended from the esophagus to the stomach. It was surrounded by thin muscularis and consisted mainly of secretory cells, although some phagocytes were present. The stomach possessed mainly secretory cells, although some ciliated cells, mucous cells, and phagocytes were present. The style sac differed from the stomach, having more ciliated cells. In intestinal regions I to In, the epithelium was shorter than in previous regions. Few cilia were present on the ridges, although many were observed in the gutters. Intestinal regions IV to V contained more mucous cells than intestine III, and more bacteria were observed associated with the fecal string than in other regions. The low incidence of bacterial association with the put epithelium was attributed to the occurrence and number of mucous cells, common throughout the digestive tract. Spherical bodies present in the lumen are believed to be fragmentation spherules involved in waste removal and enzyme release.

This work reviews physical and nutrient requirements for P. mollis culture and its nutritional value for three abalone species, the Japanese abalone Haliotis discus hannai, the red abalone Haliotis rufescens, and the U.S. Federally endangered white abalone Haliotis sorenseni. P. mollis growth was positively correlated with light over specific light densities (SLD) ranging from 0.0048 to 0.036 mol photons g(-1) fresh weight d(-1), under tumble culture conditions. Under low light conditions, growth was greatest at a temperature of 12 degreesC (SGR = 8.69 +/- 0.29% d(-1)), while under high light conditions growth was greatest at a temperature of 14-18 degreesC (SGR = 10.5 +/- 0.12% d(-1)).

Additionally, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using transcriptome sequencing. When the salinity dropped from 30 parts per thousand (S30) to 14 parts per thousand (S14), the phagocytic activity of blood lymphocytes, the O-2(-) levels produced from respiratory burst, the content of reactive oxygen species, and the activities of lysozymes and acid phosphatases increased significantly, whereas the total count of blood lymphocytes did not increase. Total count of blood lymphocytes in 22 parts per thousand salinity (S22) was significantly higher than that in any other group. The raw data obtained from sequencing were processed with Trimmomatic (Version 0.36). The expression levels of unigenes were calculated using transcripts per million (TPM) based on the effects of sequencing depth, gene length, and sample on reads. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq (Version 1.12.4). Transcriptome sequencing revealed 269 (101 up-regulated, 168 down-regulated), 326 (246 up-regulated, 80 down-regulated), and 185 (132 up-regulated, 53 down-regulated) significant DEGs from comparison of the S14 vs. S22, S22 vs. S30, and S14 vs. S30 groups, respectively. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the DEGs in these salinity comparison groups revealed that the cellular amino acid metabolic process, the regulation of protein processing, the regulation of response to stress, and other terms were significantly enriched. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis showed that nucleotide-binding, oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling pathway (ko04621), apoptosis-multiple species (ko04215), Toll and Imd signaling pathway (ko04624), NF-kappa B signaling pathway (ko04064), apoptosis (ko04210), and focal adhesion (ko04510) were significantly enriched in all salinity comparison groups. qRT-PCR verification of 12 DEGs in the above six pathways was conducted, and the results were consistent with the transcriptome sequencing results in terms of up-regulation and down-regulation, which illustrates that the transcriptome sequencing data are credible. These results were used to preliminarily explore the effects of a sudden drop of salinity on blood physiological and biochemical indexes and immunoregulatory mechanisms of A.kagoshimensis.

Abalones were placed in four stocking densities (20, 30, 40, and 50% coverage of available surface area of the culture cage) in this platform, and a control group with one density was set in the traditional aquaculture system. In addition, the effects of different diets (formulated diet, dried Laminaria japonica, and fresh Gracilaria lemaneiformis) for abalone were also studied. Over 240 days, reductions of the survival rate and growth rate of shell length and body weight were observed with the increase of the stocking density. Although the abalone were fed adequate food, the growth rate was limited by the stocking density. Condition index increased with the culture time but decreased with the increase of the stocking density. The growth rates of the shell length and body weight in the formulated diet group were significantly higher than the other two diets. The results also indicated that the medium and large-sized abalone may be more suitable for the new platform, as the medium and large-sized abalone had a higher growth rate when culturing on the mechanized platform, whereas small abalone grew faster on the traditional model.

Twelve abalone farms, with an estimated investment of US$12 million, have since been established on the coast of South Africa, with a projected production of 500-800 tons. While Haliotis midae could reach a maximum size of about 200 mm shell length at an age of over 30 years in the wild, farm production is concentrating on an average size of 100 mm after 5 years. Growth rates of 0.08-4.5% body weight day(-1) for abalone of 10-17 mm shell length have been found under stimulated farming conditions on formulated diets. while the corresponding feed conversion ratio (FCR) was 0.9-2.4. Growth rate, FCR and protein efficiency ratio decline at water temperatures above 20 degreesC. Anaesthetics, for example magnesium sulphate, are used to prevent injury during removal from tanks.

Although fish meal has been found to be the most suitable protein source for inclusion in formulated diets, plant proteins such as soy bean meal, cottonseed meal and sunflower meal presented good growth and apparent protein digestibility. The parasite sabellid polychaete, Terebrasabella heterouncinata, recently named by Australian and American researchers, is indigenous to a variety of South African intertidal molluscs and impedes growth by causing irritation beneath the mantle in abalone.

Likewise, a histological study on the gonadal morphology revealed that ripe-stage individuals fed on a Low-N G. cornea diet had a larger macrophage populations and the areas of degenerated oocytes increased. These results suggest that macroalgae cultivated in seawater enriched with ammonium may be a good choice for producing food for female H. tuberculata coccinea broodstock in the Canaries.",10.1111/j.1749-7345.2012.00617.x,"Hernandez-Cruz/0000-0001-8048-3150; Uriarte, Iker/0000-0001-5082-4188",0893-8849,1749-7345,,DEC,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2012.00617.x,

This worm is endemic to South Africa and the locally cultured abalone, Haliotis midae, are under constant threat of infestation. An understanding of factors that influence abalone growth and sabellid infestation levels under intensive culture conditions is therefore imperative to controlling infestation levels. Abalone were held on an abalone farm at stocking densities of 18%, 23% and 28% of the surface area available to the abalone. They were fed kelp or a pelleted diet, Abfeed(TM). Their growth and infestation levels were monitored for 14 months. Within the range of abalone sizes used for this study kelp-fed abalone grew significantly better than Abfeed(TM)-fed abalone (F-1,F-197 = 7.99; P less than or equal to 0.005), while stocking density had no effect (F-2,F-196 = 1.41; P less than or equal to 0.246) on growth. Abalone that became infested grew at the same rate as those that did not (0.09 less than or equal to P less than or equal to 1). No growth-limiting effect of infestation was detected. There was no effect on total intensity (i.e., the total number of worms per sample of 60 abalone; 0.41 less than or equal to P less than or equal to 1 and 0.17 less than or equal to P less than or equal to 1), or prevalence (i.e., the percentage of infected abalone within a sample; 0.50 less than or equal to P less than or equal to 1 and 0.19 less than or equal to P less than or equal to 1) of infestation by diet and stocking density, respectively. There was a significant positive coefficient of correlation of 86.2% between the level at which an increase in total intensity starts, and the average increase in total intensity per day (F-1,F-10 = 62.2; P less than or equal to 0.0001). A regression model is presented to estimate total intensity based on prevalence. The greatest increase in total intensity levels coincided with the onset of spring, and a possible seasonal component to the reproduction of this sabellid is discussed.

Seven purified dicis were formulated to provide a series of biotin (0, 0.5, 1.0. 3.0, 6.0, 12.0, 20.0 mg/kg diet). An antibiotic diet was Supplemented with tretracycline hydrochloride (4-g/kg diet) in basal diet to suppress possible intestinal bacteria synthesis. To reduce leaching. dietary biotin and other water-soluble vitamins were encapsulated by calcium alginate. Abalone juveniles of similar size (initial mean weight 175.1 +/- 3.6 mg mean shell length 11.66 +/- 0.14 mm) were distributed in a flowing-through system using it completely randomized design with eight treatments and three replicates per treatment. They were fed the appropriate diet once every day for a 110-day period. Results of this Study clearly showed the necessity of dietary biotin for juvenile abalone as the daily increment in shell length (DISL). visceral pyruvate carboxylase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase activities were significantly influenced by the dietary biotin levels (ANOVA, P < 0.05). However. the survival, specific growth rate (SGR) and carcass proximate compositions were not significantly influenced by dietary biotin at the end of the experimental period. The viscera biotin concentration (VBC) of abalone increased as the biotin supplementation level increased (r = 0.91). Compared to those of other groups, SGR, DISL, VBC and two carboxylase activities of antibiotic group were obviously depressed. It indicated that the intestinal microflora probably contribute to biotin nutrition for juvenile abalone. Based on measurements of DISL and two carboxylase activities, the optimum biotin requirement was estimated to be 0.42 mg/kg and 0.67-0.70 mg/kg for maximum growth and carboxylase activities, respectively.",,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,JUN,,

The demand is increasing especially for proteins as ingredients; however, the amino acid profile is essential for evaluation of the nutritional value of proteins. The year-round protein concentration and amino acid profiles of Saccharina latissima were determined, and the harvest time and nutritional potential were evaluated. Bi-monthly samples were analyzed from S. latissima (including epiphytes, when present) cultivated commercially at an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) site and a reference site in Denmark in 2013-2014. Overall, there was no significant difference for the tested parameters between the two sampling sites; however, seasonal variations were found. The protein concentration varied markedly reaching a maximum of 10.8 % dry weight (DW) in November and a minimum of 1.3 % DW in May 2013. Aspartic and glutamic acids dominated the amino acid profile, accounting for up to 49 % of the total. Greatest seasonal differences in amino acid composition occurred in July, with leucine contributing most (22.7-26.7 %) of the observed differences. A maximal essential amino acid (EAA) score of 68.9 % (based on WHO/FAO/UNU requirements) was achieved in November 2013. The presence of epiphytes in July to November changed neither the amino acid content nor the EAA score. S. latissima is comparable with wheat as a protein ingredient for fish feed and appears to be a suitable protein/amino acid source for human consumption. This study proposes that there may be a mismatch between harvest time and nutritional value. The preferable harvest time for S. latissima is November, due to high protein content and EAA score.

Abalone were fed Gracilaria sp. within a randomized 2 x 3 factorial experiment using 2 stocking densities (T1 (500 pieces/m(2)) and T2 (1,000 pieces/m(2))) and 3 cages (D1, box; D2, mesh cage; D3, prefabricated multitier trays). In addition, 3 stocking densities (T1, 50 pieces/m(2); T2, 100 pieces/m; T3, 200 pieces/m) were evaluated in the prefabricated multitier trays. We found that, in the nursery experiment, 4-mo-old tropical abalone juveniles reared for 90 d showed no significant differences in growth (shell length and body weight) and survival rates among the 3 nursery cages used (Tukey's post hoc test, P > 0.05). Feed conversion ratio, however, was lowest for the high-density treatment T1D3 (7.8 +/- 0.76) and was significantly different from the low density treatment T1D1 (11.32 +/- 1.2) and intermediate density treatment T1D2 (12.39 +/- 1.12; t-test, P > 0.05). Conversely, at higher densities (T2), the same trend applied with abalone reared in multitier basket systems (T2D3), having the highest growth rates and survival rates (29.3 +/- 0.07 mm average shell length (ASL) and 5.16 +/- 0.52 g average body weight (ABW)), followed closely by those reared in mesh cages (T2D2) and boxes (T2D1). Feed conversion ratio was also lowest for T2D3 (7.56 +/- 0.79) and was significantly lower than T2D1 and T2D2. Between treatments, however, abalone reared at lower densities (T1) had significantly higher growth and survival than those reared at higher densities (T2), regardless of the nursery cage used, indicating an inverse relationship between stocking density, growth, and survival. For the grow-out study, tropical abalone reared in multitier trays at low densities (T1) attained the highest growth in shell length and body weight (49.7 +/- 0.11 mm ASL and 29.8 +/- 2.6 g ABW, respectively) at 180 d of culture, which was significantly greater than those reared in the high-density treatment (T3) with significantly smaller shell length and body weight (43.8 +/- 0.18 mm ASL and 21.2 +/- 2.0 g ABW), but not significantly different than the intermediate density treatment. This trend started from day 60 of culture onward when analyzed using Duncan's multiple range test (P > 0.05). Survival rates were not significantly different among stocking density treatments, nor were feed conversion ratios. We recommend, for nursery rearing of abalone juveniles, using multitier trays (D3) or boxes (D1) at 500 pieces/m(2) stocking density to attain a grow-out size of 26-30 mm in shell length in 90 days. A stocking density of 100 pieces/m(2) is recommended to grow abalone in multitier trays to attain a cocktail size of 50 mm ASL and 30 g ABW in 180 d with survival rates between 85.6% and 83.1%.",10.2983/035.032.0105,"de la Pena, Milagros R./0000-0001-8842-8922",0730-8000,1943-6319,,APR,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.032.0105,

Larger abalones (> 2 cm) grow better in dark conditions and the possibility that this is true for postlarvae is explored in this contribution. Two independent experiments with Haliotis rufescens postlarvae fed the diatom Navicula incerta were conducted in 10-mL vessels with daily water changes. Two factors were tested following split-plot experimental designs: six diatom densities (from 500-10,000 cells/mm(2)) and two light conditions (constant light at 19-33 mu E/m(2)/s and darkness). Experimental units in darkness were kept inside black plastic bags but subjected to similar to 30 min of ambient light every day for maintenance. Food (N. incerta) was supplied as required to maintain diatom densities. The first experiment started with 14-day-old postlarvae and was conducted for 20 days the second trial started with 2-day old postlarvae and was performed for 32 days. In general, postlarval growth increased as diatom density increased but stabilized at high densities (ca. > 2,000 cell/mm(2)) and was significantly higher in darkness in both trials. In Experiment 1. average growth rate in darkness was 2.4 times higher than in light conditions (34.7 and 14.4 p,mu m/d, respectively). In Experiment 2, average growth in darkness was 3.0 times higher than under constant illumination (14.4 and 4.8 mu m/d, respectively). These results are discussed in terms of postlarval behavior and possible changes in the nutritional quality of diatom films.

The result showed that sulfate group had no obvious effect on the reaction of AGSP with RAW 264.7 cells, but it affected the growth properties of gut microbes that able to utilize AGSP. The mice experiment showed that D-AGSP reduced weight gain, fat accumulation and lipid metabolism disorder in HFD-fed mice as well as AGSP, and no differences between them were found. Sequencing analysis showed that sulfate group influenced AGSP-induced alterations of the gut microbiota at higher taxonomic levels, some of which had close correlation with the improvement of physiological index.

Octopus discovered and exploited the influx of prey within the first week following stocking; their densities surged and then returned to pre-stocking levels after 2 months. This was not observed with any other predator. Damage from crustacean, fish, and octopus predation was observed on the recovered abalone shells, but were not correlated with predator densities. A larger percentage of recovered small shells had evidence of crustacean and fish predation, indicating there may be size-specific impacts of predators on abalone.

Culture plates are initially sprayed with microalgal powder/agar gel solution to induce larval settlement. Abalone seed are then raised on an artificial diet/agar gel solution which is sprayed directly onto the culture plates. This study was conducted to test SAPPS on a commercial scale against the diatom biofilm method and two further trials were conducted to investigate the optimum feeding frequency and agar concentration for SAPPS. A total of 100,000 larval Haliotis diversicolor aquatilis were induced to settle onto 90 mucus conditioned commercial rearing plates (5 racks X 18 plates each) in 1500-1 tanks to test two treatments; diatom biofilm method and SAPPS. The trial was conducted over a 6-week period and the temperature averaged 24.2 +/- 1.0 degreesC. Settlement was similar on all plates in the two treatments. The settlement rate per plate was 17,820 8460 for the diatom biofilm and 17,280 6390 for SAPPS. The postlarval growth rate on the SAPPS plates was over 50% higher than the growth rate on the diatom plates. The final length of postlarvae was significantly higher (p < 0.05) on SAPPS plates (3281 +/- 573 mum) than on diatom biofilm plates (2231 +/- 314 mum). Furthermore, the survival of postlarvae was also five times higher on SAPPS (51.7%) compared with diatom biofilm (10.6%). SAPPS plates were heavily colonized by marine bacteria which may have acted as a food source for early postlarvae and assisted in the breakdown of polysaccharides. The whole body protein of juveniles was 17.2% in SAPPS compared to 13.3% in diatom biofilm which may suggest that artificial diet was a more balanced and complete nutrient source than diatom biofilm. Smaller scale trials were conducted over 25 days to determine optimum concentration of agar (2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 mg/ml) and also to determine specific feed frequency (daily, every second day and every third day). There was no significant difference (p>0.05) in survival rate in both trials. However, the growth rate of postlarvae at 2.5 mg/ml agar was significantly lower than the other treatments and the leaching rate (% weight loss of food) was double that of agar concentrations 5.0-10.0 mg/ml. Growth rate was highest (p < 0.05) in the feed frequency experiment for postlarvae fed daily and lowest for those fed every third day. The results suggested that agar concentration was optimal at between 5.0 and 10.0 mg/ml with plates being sprayed daily. SAPPS has potential to be used in industry depending on the development of a mechanized, cost-efficient system for spraying the plates. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

There were three replicates of each experimental group (stocking density and culture method) and the experiment lasted for 180 days. The results showed that the survival rate, specific growth rate of shell length and body weight, food intake and feed conversion efficiency of the abalones cultured in suspension cages were significantly lower than those in the bottom sown group. For abalones cultured by bottom sowing, there was no significant difference between the specific growth rate of shell length and body weight, feed conversion efficiency, alpha-amylase, cellulase activity and the expression levels of Hdlam on each sampling occasion for the 400 and 600 ind/m(2) treatments. However, these parameters were significantly higher in both the 400 and 600 ind/m(2) treatments compared with the 800 ind/m(2) treatment. When the stocking density was increased to 800 ind/m(2), the food intake and the expression levels of Hdaly, Hdcel, Hdamyl of the abalones cultured in both culture methods were significantly lower than the 400 and 600 ind/m(2) treatments. This indicates that even with sufficient food supply, some abalones were unable to capture food due to the constraints of the culture space and the feeding method used by abalones, resulting in reduced growth. The findings of this research suggest that the growth and food intake of abalones can be promoted and production can be improved at a stocking density of 600 ind/m(2).",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735693,,0044-8486,1873-5622,,Dec-15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735693,

Two selection criteria were investigated, one used family breeding values for liability to disease challenge test infection and the other used a direct selection of the best performing individuals across families for growth rate. Five scales of breeding programme were tested and the model predicted that if growth rate is the only selection criterion, breeding programmes of a scale using 150 families of each species each generation would result in 12-13% genetic improvement in initial generations and have the greatest beneficial economic impact on the Australian abalone industry of the options tested. The model predicts an average discounted benefit-cost ratio of 48:1, total added discounted benefit of AU$4.90 for each kilogram of abalone produced and nominal economic effect on operating income of over AU$16 million per year after 10 years. If disease resistance is the only selective breeding criterion, 100 families of each species would result in the highest benefit-cost ratio of the options tested, although some genetic gain would need to be sacrificed to reduce inbreeding to acceptable levels in this scenario.

The diet of female broodstock and the conditioning regimen are likely to influence these parameters. In this study we examine the effect of broodstock diet (three formulated diets differing in levels of the fatty acid, Arachidonic acid [ARA], and a red seaweed diet) and spawning frequency on egg diameter variability both within a batch of eggs spawned from one female and between batches of eggs. Greenlip abalone broodstock were spawned at the beginning of the experiment and again every 16 wks (1131 degrees C days effective accumulative temperature [EAT]) using commercial hatchery practices. The variability of egg diameter within batches spawned from the same female over three consecutive spawning rounds and within diet treatments was determined. Cytoplasm diameter, vitelline layer and jelly coat thickness of unfertilized eggs were also compared between eggs spawned from individual females and between females. In addition. the relationships between broodstock parameters (weight and shell length) and egg diameter were explored. Eggs spawned from females feeding on a red seaweed diet were smaller than eggs from the low ARA treatment. Depending on spawning frequency, broodstock diet can influence the cytoplasm diameter and jelly coat thickness. No relationship between egg diameter and broodstock parameters was found. However, batches spawned from the same female abalone became more variable over time with a shift in size frequency distribution. Results indicate that the variability of egg diameter within a batch changes from female to female and highlights the importance of selecting successful broodstock for conditioning at commercial hatcheries.",10.2983/0730-8000(2006)25[195:IOCDAS]2.0.CO;2,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,APR,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/0730-8000(2006)25[195:IOCDAS]2.0.CO;2,

Seasonal oscillations of oceanographic factors additionally influence their physiology, stress responses and survival. Tissue responses to seasonal variations in green ormer (Haliotis tuberculata L.) and Mediterranean scallop (Pecten jacobaeus L.) in the Northern Adriatic have not been reported. Hence, their biochemical and antioxidant defense properties over seasons were studied and the microanatomical structure of their tissue was correlated with function. Histological analysis of gonads revealed two peaks of gonadal maturation and spawning during the spring/summer period and winter season for scallops, and one peak during the fall for ormers. The gonadal maturation of both species was correlated with their seasonal variations of metabolic demands and antioxidant capacity. The lipid vacuoles of tubuloacinar terminations in the digestive gland differed between the two species; in scallop they are several-fold larger in size and number. Low temperatures in winter contributed to a decline in enzymatic antioxidant defense in scallop tissues, having lower superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, and higher concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and total antioxidant status (TAS). In ormers, winter induced lower TAS, TBARS, SOD and GPx concentrations. The significant difference of winter TAS and TBARS levels between ormers and scallops was correlated with variations in their reproductive cycles, as well as in antioxidant defense systems.

Exposure of abalone to PST supplemented feed for 50 days did not affect behaviour or survival but saw accumulation of up to 1.6 mu g STX-equivalent 100 g(-1) in the abalone foot tissue (muscle, mouth without oesophagus and epipodial fringe), which is similar to 50 times lower than the maximum permissible limit (80 mu g 100 g(-1) tissue) for PSTs in molluscan shellfish. The PST levels in the foot were reduced to 0.48 mu g SIX-equivalent 100 g(-1) after scrubbing and removal of the pigment surrounding the epithelium of the epipodial fringe (confirmed by both HPLC and LC-MS/MS). Thus, scrubbing the epipodial fringe, a common procedure during commercial abalone canning, reduced PST levels by similar to 70%. Only trace levels of PSTs were detected in the viscera (stomach, gut, heart, gonad, gills and mantle) of the abalone. A toxin reduction of approximately 73% was observed in STX-contaminated abalone held in clean water and fed uncontaminated food over 50 days. The low level of PST uptake when abalone were exposed to high numbers of A. minutum cells over a prolonged period may indicate a low risk of PSP poisoning to humans from the consumption of H. laevigata that has been exposed to a bloom of potentially toxic A. minutum in Australia.

This study investigated whether the negative impact of high stocking density in shallow raceway tanks could be ameliorated by optimizing water flow. We quantified the effect of flow rate (87-246 L min-1) on the performance of 2-year-old hybrid abalone (Haliotis laevigata and Haliotis rubra) held at two stocking densities (11400 and 7600 tank-1). A 50% higher density yielded a 27% increase in biomass gain, despite a 10% growth reduction and 3% higher mortality. At the lower density, there was an optimal flow rate of approximately 200 L-1, at which biomass gain was 474 kg and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was 1.31. At the higher density, biomass gain (max = 658 kg) and FCR (min = 1.41) improved linearly with increasing flow, suggesting that an optimal flow rate exists at 246 L-1 or beyond those tested. Increased oxygen availability with increasing flow is thought to have enhanced abalone performance, although flows greater than 200 L min-1 may have reduced performance at low density due to feed washout and nutrient leaching.

As a result, stripping the spats (35 mm) off by anaesthetization and switching the diet from live diatoms to artificial powdered diet in combination has to be performed in most of the abalone farms. This manipulation normally leads to more than 50% mortality. Here we report the direct use of the unicellular green alga Platymonas helgolandica Kylin var. tsingtaoensis as a potential alga to be used to settle the veliger larvae of the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai and to feed the postlarvae. Settlement rate of 2-day-old veliger larvae in mono culture of P helgolandica could be as high as 92% ( +/- 4.2%) on day 10 in small scale trials, higher than that in the selected benthic diatom strain (53.6% +/- 12.7%) when settled in the water in which bacteria propagation was controlled by treatment of 2 ppm of benzylpenicillinum calcium and streptomycin sulfate. Postlarvae fed solely on P. helgolandica or the selected benthic diatom Navicula-2005-A grew at rates of 40.1 ( +/- 1.9) and 45.8 (+/- 13.4) mu m day(-1), respectively, when raised at 22 degrees C until day 50 postfertilization. P. helgolandica was shown to have distinct diurnal settling rhythm characterized with a peak of settled cells in the middle of the night for cell division and a peak of free-swimming cells in the middle of the day. High density of attached P. helgolandica cells on the inner surface of the culture facility in the night fits the nocturnal feeding behavior of the abalone spats. Judged by the promising larvae settling rate, growth and survival rates of the postlarvae fed with this alga, the free-swimming micro-green alga P. helgolandica constitutes a potential species for settling the veliger larvae and for supporting the growth of postlarvae as well.

So far, there has been limited interest in tackling the biological and technical feasibility of cultivation of C concholepas. Hence, the knowledge about its early ontogenetic stages (i.e., larval, early postmetamorphic and small juvenile) cultivation is still deficient. In this study we investigated, under laboratory and field conditions, C. concholepas survivorship, growth rates, feeding rates and the onset of sexual reproduction. Competent loco's larvae were collected in the field and metamorphosed in the laboratory to assess growth rates and survivorship during the first six months of postmetamorphic life. Moreover, using small juvenile C. concholepas of ca. 20 mm of peristomal length, collected in the field, we monitored for the body size and live weight traits in laboratory and field rearing conditions. The feeding of the early postmetamorphics and small juveniles was exclusively based in mono diets of the mussel Semimytilus algosus. The rearing of small juveniles was conducted in two consecutive phases, using two specially designed rearing apparatus. The biochemical content of our laboratory cultivated specimens was compared with values obtained from specimens collected in natural habitats. Their rapid growth and good survivorship makes this species suitable for rearing of cocktail-size specimens (50-60 mm) in less than a year. According to the growing rates reported in this study the legal commercial size of C. concholepas: 100 mm of PL would be reached under field and laboratory conditions in 1.65 and 2.64 years respectively. Moreover, it was found that in our rearing conditions C. concholepas reach sexual maturity in less than a year of benthic life. In summary, considering the findings about C. concholepas high growth rates, and low mortalities, we suggest that our rearing methodologies may be scaled up and implemented for the commercial aquaculture of this unique and valuable muricid.

Rearing was carried out over a period of 226 days, after which it could be concluded that an advantage in overall growth performance had been gained by grading the animals. There was evidence that growth of small abalone improved in the absence of larger conspecifics. In the stocking density experiment with two size grades and three stocking densities, a decreasing exponential relationship was found between growth (body weight and shell length) and stocking density, with a substantial amount of growth occurring at all densities. Final total biomass for both grades of abalone increased with density. For the smaller grade biomass gain increased as density increased. However, for the larger grade biomass gain declined at higher density. Overall mean survival (+/- s.e) was 98.3 +/- 0.4% and was not influenced by density.

A semiclosed recirculating land-based system was used with stocking densities of 368, 735, and 1,100 individuals/m(2). Each stocking density had 3 replicates. An artificial diet, modified from a shrimp commercial diet, was used throughout this experiment. In July 2008, initial sizes of abalone (mean shell length (SL) +/- SE) were not statistically different, with values of 1.28 +/- 0.0062, 1.28 +/- 0.0131, and 1.30 +/- 0.0339 cm for 368, 735, and 1,100 individuals/m(2), respectively (P>0.05). After 8 mo, SLs were significantly different, with values of 3.63 +/- 0.092, 3.25 +/- 0.1173, and 3.05 +/- 0.0985 cm for the 3 stocking densities. As the stocking density increased, mean specific growth rates, measured by the percent increase in SL during the 8-mo period, decreased, with values (mean +/- SD) of 1.97 +/- 0.0495, 1.66 +/- 0.1595, and 1.53 +/- 0.0544. The mean specific growth rate of the density 368 individuals/m(2) was significantly different from 735 individuals/m(2) and 1,100 individuals/m(2). The variations of specific growth rate, calculated in term of the coefficient of variation (mean SD) were increased with increasing stocking densities: 20.16 +/- 0.251, 22.17 +/- 3.146, and 23.66 +/- 0.886. The difference was significant only between the 368 individuals/m(2) and the 1,100 individuals/m(2). The best-fit linear equations between the natural logarithm of specific growth rate and initial size of abalone for 3 stocking densities were estimated. These equations demonstrated that specific growth rates of the larger size abalone decreased at higher rates than that of the smaller size as the stocking density increased. This demonstrated a nonrandom effect of stocking density on abalone size. This also implied that grading of large abalone should be done regularly. Allometric equations between shell width (SW) and SL as well as between total weight (TW) and SL were calculated: SW = 0.6531 SL0.777 (r(2) = 0.721) and TW = 0.3276 SL2.720 (r(2) = 0.823), respectively. Throughout this 8-mo experiment, survival rates of abalone were not significantly different, with values of 95.1 +/- 5.05, 92.9 +/- 6.19, and 95.7 +/- 0.513 at stocking densities of 368, 735, and 1,100 individuals/m(2), respectively.",10.2983/035.029.0307,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,NOV,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.029.0307,

The levels of ammonium nitrogen and nitrite in the water of coculture groups were lower than those in control group (abalone alone) throughout the experiment. No mass mortality occurred in any groups, but abalone in coculture groups showed significantly better growth performance and higher survival, suggesting that coculture of juvenile abalone with sea cucumber, a deposit-feeding species, can reduce the levels of inorganic nitrogen in the water and consequently enhance growth.

Abalones, a type of large marine gastropods, are the most commercially important species in aquaculture for Asia. To evaluate the potential ecological risk posed by temperature stress, we measured biological responses such as survival rate, adhesion ability (falling rate), and foot abnormalities in the abalone Haliotis discus hannai. Additionally, biochemical and molecular responses were evaluated in H. discus hannai exposed to various temperature gradients. The survival rate was reduced in abalones exposed to relative high temperatures (more than 26 degrees C). Increased temperature stress induced a higher falling rate and abnormal foot structure. Furthermore, increased antioxidant enzyme activities were observed in abalones exposed to relative high temperatures (26 and 28 degrees C). The activities of superoxide dismutase were induced in a time-dependent manner after high temperature stress. Generally, heat shock protein 90 also increased significantly in H. discus hannai exposed to temperature gradients (more than 24 degrees C) for 12 h. These results provide valuable information regarding stress responses to increased temperatures, in H. discus hannai: adverse biological and molecular outcomes could be utilized as risk assessments and stress monitoring of marine ecosystems under increased water temperatures.

Laboratory experiments were conducted for 8 or 9 wk with turban snail of 3 size groups, early juveniles with 1.26-mm and 2.89-mm shell diameters and juveniles with an 8.1-mm shell height. The 2 diameter size groups of early juveniles grew well (22.3 +/- 5.5 mu m/day and 16.4 +/- 4.2 mu m/day, respectively; mean +/- SD) on ACA with natural diatom densities, whereas the growth rates were significantly lower on ACA with reduced diatom densities in both size groups (6.7 +/- 0.8 mu m/day and 4.0 +/- 2.2 mu m/day, respectively). A significant difference in growth rate was also found between early juveniles of 1.26 mm on Agar with natural and reduced diatom densities. In contrast, no significant difference was detected in juveniles of 2.89 mm on Agar with natural and reduced diatom densities. Although turban snail juveniles of 8.1 mm reared on Agar with natural diatom densities had very high growth rates (106.1 +/- 18.3 mu m/day), the mean growth rate of juveniles on ACA with natural diatom densities was relatively low (10.9 +/- 5.8 mu m/day). The results of the 3 feeding experiments indicate that diatoms are an important food source for juvenile T. commis from 1.25 mm to approximately 4.0 mm, and that the importance of fronds of G. elegans as a food source increases as juveniles increase in size. In addition, the species composition and density of diatoms on ACA fronds collected from a nursery habitat of the turban snail were observed continuously for approximately 2 y.

The Puget Sound Restoration Fund, in collaboration with state and federal agencies, has been outplanting juvenile pinto abalone at sites in the San Juan Archipelago, and some sites are much more successful than others despite similar physical characteristics. The sites, however, likely differ in oceanic parameters, such as temperature, salinity, and pH, which are in turn changing as the climate of the Earth is changing. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of temperature fluctuation and pCO(2) levels on the survival, growth, and oxygen consumption of juvenile pinto abalone. In a fully crossed experiment, juvenile pinto abalone were held at either currently ambient (400 ppm) or elevated (1,200 ppm) pCO(2) and at constant (10 degrees C) or fluctuating (10 -> 14 -> 10 degrees C) temperature. Survival was monitored weekly and growth was measured after 4 wk. In a second experiment, abalone were held in the same crossed pCO(2) and temperature treatments, and oxygen consumption was measured. High pCO(2) and fluctuating temperature both significantly decreased abalone survival. Abalone growth was not affected by pCO(2) level (temperature could not be analyzed due to very poor survival in the fluctuating temperature treatments). In addition, there was an interaction between fluctuating temperature and pCO(2) level on abalone oxygen consumption. Abalone in the constant temperature treatment had higher oxygen consumption when exposed to elevated pCO(2); however, this pattern was not observed in the fluctuating temperature treatment. The results of this experiment indicate that outplant sites with minimal temperature fluctuation and lower pCO(2) levels could lead to improvements in outplanting success of juvenile pinto abalone.",10.2983/035.043.0207,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,AUG,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.043.0207,

However, the optimal cultural conditions that maximize the advantages of triploidy in the abalone have yet to be determined. This study examined the properties of triploid Pacific abalone after 3 months of culture under three constant temperatures (18 degrees C, 22 degrees C, and 26 degrees C) to fill up this information gap. The results showed that the survival rate of triploids in the 26 degrees C group was significantly higher than that of diploids (P < 0.05), while the survival rate of triploids in the other two groups was similar to that of diploids (P > 0.05). Except for the shell width of the 22 degrees C group and the shell length of the 26 degrees C group, triploid Pacific abalone exhibited significantly superior growth traits compared to diploids at all temperatures (P < 0.05). The most notable improvement was observed in the foot muscle weight trait, where there were triploid advantage rates of 81.44% (18 degrees C), 76.21% (22 degrees C), and 54.96% (26 degrees C). The specific growth rate and the ratio of shell length and body weight indicated that triploids grew the fastest in the 22 degrees C group.

In summary, this study confirmed the triploid advantage in meat yield of Pacific abalone and identified a temperature range that maximizes their growth rate.

In this study, GST kappa (GST kappa) from the disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus; AbGST kappa) was characterized at both the transcriptional and functional levels to determine its potential capacity to perform as a detoxification agent under conditions of different stress. The predicted AbGST kappa protein consists of 227 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 25.6 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 7.78. In silico analysis reveals that AbGST kappa is a disulfide bond formation protein A (DsbA), consisting of a thioredoxin domain, GSH binding sites (G-sites), and a catalytic residue. In contrast, no hydrophobic ligand binding site (H-site), or signal peptides, were detected. AbGST kappa showed the highest sequence identity with the orthologue from pufferfish (Takifugu obscurus) (60.0%). In a phylogenetic tree, AbGST kappa clustered closely together with other fish GST kappa s, and was evolutionarily distanced from other cytosolic GSTs. The predicted three-dimensional structure clearly demonstrates that the dimer adopts a butterfly-like shape. A tissue distribution analysis revealed that GST kappa was highly expressed in the digestive tract, suggesting it has detoxification ability. Depending on the tissue and time, AbGST kappa showed different expression patterns, and levels of expression, following challenge of the abalone with immune stimulants. Enzyme kinetics of the purified recombinant proteins demonstrated its conjugating ability using 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and glutathione (GSH) as substrates, and suggested it has a low affinity for both substrates. The optimum temperature and pH for the rAbGST kappa GSH: CDNB conjugating activity were found to be 35 degrees C and pH 8, respectively indicating that the abalone is well adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions. Cibacron blue (100 mu M) was capable of completely inhibiting rAbGST kappa (100%) with an IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of 0.05 mu M. A disk diffusion assay revealed that rAbGST kappa could significantly protect cells from H2O2 , CdCl2, and ZnCl2.

Fatty acids such as 18:1n-7, 18:2n-6, 16:4n-3, arachidonic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid were suggested to affect settlement and survival. The fatty acids correlated with settlement were different from the ones associated with survival rates, except eicosapentaenoic acid, which correlated with both.

The role of plasticity and acclimation, within and across generations, may be essential given the pace of change. We investigated plasticity across generations and life stages in response to ocean acidification (OA), which poses a growing threat to both wild populations and the sustainable aquaculture of shellfish. Most studies of OA on shellfish focus on acute effects, and less is known regarding the longer term carryover effects that may manifest within or across generations. We assessed these longer term effects in red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) using a multi-generational split-brood experiment. We spawned adults raised in ambient conditions to create offspring that we then exposed to high pCO(2) (1180 mu atm; simulating OA) or low pCO(2) (450 mu atm; control or ambient conditions) during the first 3 months of life. We then allowed these animals to reach maturity in ambient common garden conditions for 4 years before returning the adults into high or low pCO(2) treatments for 11 months and measuring growth and reproductive potential. Early-life exposure to OA in the F1 generation decreased adult growth rate even after 5 years especially when abalone were re-exposed to OA as adults. Adult but not early-life exposure to OA negatively impacted fecundity. We then exposed the F2 offspring to high or low pCO(2) treatments for the first 3 months of life in a fully factorial, split-brood design. We found negative transgenerational effects of parental OA exposure on survival and growth of F2 offspring, in addition to significant direct effects of OA on F2 survival. These results show that the negative impacts of OA can last within and across generations, but that buffering against OA conditions at critical life-history windows can mitigate these effects.",10.1111/gcb.17048,"Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663; Boles, Sara/0000-0002-3916-2547",1354-1013,1365-2486,,JAN,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.17048,37988193
"Durand, F",Insects and food security in South Africa in the light of climate change,2022,TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE,62,4,623,646,,"The Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating socio-economic effect on the country, including the death of more than 102 000 people, many of whom were the breadwinners of their families. This could not have happened at a worse time, since the economy of the country was in a recession even before the pandemic. The situation is exacerbated by the highest level of unemployment in the world, widespread nepotism and corruption, the plundering of state coffers and the favouring of the business interests of BRICS partners by government officials over those of South Africans. The government's commitment to prioritising their BRICS partners' business interests over those of the South African people contributes to food insecurity in South Africa. This includes the export of coal from mines in Mpumalanga to China and India, while nothing is done to rehabilitate the region, which was once known for its agriculture. The government handed over to the Chinese company SAEMB the Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone, where four opencast mines, a 3 300 MW power station and an iron smelting plant will be developed. This development, however, requires the government to build a dam that will harvest 60% of the annual runoff of the Limpopo River, which in turn will have a devastating effect on farmers and communities downriver in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique who irrigate their crops with water from the Limpopo River. The same kowtowing of the South African government to its BRICS partners can be seen in the reluctance with which the government responds to the plundering of our marine resources by Chinese fishing boats and abalone smugglers. The unfair competition imposed on local chicken farmers by distributers of dumped chicken, mainly from Brazil, with the approval of government, caused the closure of several South African chicken farms and the resulting loss of tens of thousands of jobs along the supply chain. The reluctance of the government to take sides in the Russia-Ukraine war is partly linked to the fact that South Africa imports fertilizer and wheat from Russia. South Africa, a water-scarce country, is more vulnerable than many other countries to the effects of global climate change. The abnormal rain pattern, that is characterised by severe droughts in certain regions and heavy rainstorms and floods in others, has a devastating impact on the already economically struggling South African community. Abroad, attempts are made to ensure that mean temperatures do not exceed the pre-industrial level mark by more than 1,5 degrees C. South Africa, however, heats up twice as fast as many other countries, and has already exceeded the pre-industrial era level by more than 2 degrees C; it will continue to get warmer and drier, causing most of the country to become desertified by 2050. A third of South African rivers do not reach the sea anymore because of over abstraction of water from rivers; similarly, there is extensive abstraction of groundwater. Together farming and forestry account for 70% of water use in South Africa. This over abstraction of water, worsened by the heat and aridification resulting from climate change, led to the degradation of most wetland and estuarine ecosystems and the drying and burning of irreplaceable peatlands. These political, socioeconomic and environmental calamities create the worst possible scenario for food security in South Africa. Already one in four people in Africa suffers from food insecurity and this number will rapidly rise in the wake of global climate change, which will result in the loss of two thirds of arable land by 2025. South Africa is nearing socioeconomic collapse. This, in conjunction with continuing droughts, storms and rising temperatures associated with global climate change, will lead to food insecurity, starvation and anarchy. The effect of global climate change will make it progressively more difficult to produce enough food for the South African population. It is imperative that South Africans consider alternative methods of food production, including water use. Entomophagy is widely practiced throughout the world, but is especially prevalent in South America, the Far East and Africa, where approximately 2 billion people use 1 900 species of insects as food. The nutritional value of insects is unsurpassed and, in some respects, even more nutritious than meat. The larvae of the black soldier fly (BSF) Hermetia illucens are a source of high-quality proteins and unsaturated fats that are used worldwide as animal feed. Insects are a source of minerals such as iron, calcium, copper, zinc and magnesium and high levels of vitamin A, B 2 and C. The ecological and socioeconomic benefits of using BSF larvae instead of grain as feed for fish, chickens and pigs are enormous. BSF larvae can be bred almost for free by feeding it a wide variety of organic waste, including rotten vegetables and fruit, manure and even carcases that would have ended up in rubbish dumps and would have contributed to the methane and carbon dioxide pollution emanating from such dumps. The water use of BSF is negligible, because the water in the organic waste that would have been discarded in waste dumps is sufficient to sustain them. BSF affords the subsistence and small-scale farmer the opportunity to raise chickens at a lower input cost than ever before. The conversion of feed to food in insects is far greater than that of chickens, pigs or cattle. In the case of the house cricket (Acheta domestica) the conversion rate of feed to food is twice as effective as that of chickens, four times as effective as pigs and twelve times greater than that of cattle. Compared to conventional farming, this implies that with insects far more exceptionally nutritious food can be produced in a smaller area, with little water and no poison or fertilizer whatsoever, while waste and the associated methane gas are removed from the environment at the same time. A few South African companies have already seen the potential of insects as food and feed. Even though insect farming is still in its infancy, it is already generating jobs and new socioeconomic opportunities in South Africa. Insect farming, especially BSF farming, will in the near future probably grow in popularity all over the world as an affordable, healthy, ecologically sustainable alternative food source that will, directly or indirectly, be consumed by humans. BSF afford the environmentally conscious homesteader who wants to produce livestock such as chickens, fish, or pigs in a sustainable manner an unsurpassed environmentally friendly alternative. BSF will also give the desperate, impoverished and starving population of the future an alternative free source of feed that will offer them economic prospects and food security.",10.17159/2224-7912/2022/v62n4a1,,0041-4751,,,DEC,http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/2224-7912/2022/v62n4a1,

The effect of dehulled soybean meal (DSM), soy protein concentrate (SPC) and corn gluten meal (CGM) on abalone H. discus hannai were evaluated through 16S rRNA, transcriptomics and metabolomics in the present study. The core gut microbiota of abalone varied among the different diet groups (DSM, SPC and GCM): Mycoplasma (57.51 %, 64.39 %, 70.23 %). Multi-omics integrative analysis indicated that abalone fed with the SPC diet effectively activated nutrients metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis via microbiota-gut-digestive gland axis. Abalone fed with the SPC diet had the lowest chewiness, gumminess and hardness of muscle. Moreover, abalone fed with the DSM diet significantly increased the abundance of Bacteroidetes, which significantly impacted the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis metabolism through the microbiota-gut-digestive gland axis. In contrast, the CGM diet led to a significant changes in the gut microbiota of abalone, characterized by an increased abundance of Marinifilaceae and Bacteroides, while the abundance of Proteobacteria decreased. This microbial change was associated with reduced activity of the gut digestive enzyme pectinase, ultimately affecting the efficiency of nutrient absorption. In addition, there was a correlation between gut microbial abundance, gut enzyme activities and cell-free hemolymph metabolite content, which might be the reason for the difference in utilization of different plant protein sources by abalone. These results light the functional interaction between the gut milieu and the digestive gland axis under the efficacy of different protein sources.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2025.742501,,0044-8486,1873-5622,,Jul-15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2025.742501,

Very few studies have focused on the individual consistency of foraging behaviour in marine herbivores. Because marine ectotherms are strongly influenced by their environment and because a mixed diet is appropriate for herbivores, we hypothesized thatHaliotis tuberculata, a large marine gastropod, would not exhibit significant individual consistency in foraging activity and would display generalist food choices. To test these hypotheses, the behaviour of 120 abalone was studied using a choice test of eight macroalgal species over 3 weeks, with video recording 24 hr a day. In addition, primary components, secondary metabolites and toughness of the eight algae were measured. At the population level, food choice was mainly related to the protein composition and the toughness of the macroalgae. We found thatH. tuberculatais a generalist species feeding on a variety of algae (IS = 0.64), even if 21% of the individuals can be considered to be specialists. However, in contrast to our hypothesis, highly consistent between-individual variation was observed in foraging activity (ICC = 0.81 for time spent feeding and ICC = 0.74 for number of feeding visits per day).

Superior hybrids are widely utilized in aquaculture with large benefits. As a typical example, interspecific hybrid Lvpan abalone (Haliotis discus hannai female x H. fulgens male) also has excellent growth performance, as well as advantaged thermal tolerance. Nevertheless, the mechanisms responsible for this growth heterosis in Lvpan hybrid abalone have remained elusive. In this study, a twomonth thermostatic acclimation experiment was conducted for Lvpan abalone and its parental species at three temperatures (14, 18, and 24 C-degrees). The results showed that the interspecific hybrid 'Lvpan' abalone exhibited significant growth heterosis when compared to its parental species, especially at high temperatures. Transcriptome dynamics in the foot muscles of abalones also unveiled that most genes expression patterns represented to be maternal-biased, which are involved in growth-related process. It indicated that maternal effects on gene expression in hybrid abalones play can play an important role in growth heterosis. Moreover, we observed that most genes expressed non-additively in the hybrid abalone are involved in the regulation of growth and cell differentiation during development, which play pivotal roles in the formation of growth heterosis.

High water temperature (>24 C-degrees) is widely accepted as a key contributor to elevated summer mortality. High crude protein levels in modern abalone diets may interact with elevated water temperature to produce detrimental effects on abalone physiological processes but have received scant attention. This study measured the energy used in the digestion, absorption, and assimilation (i.e., specific dynamic action (SDA)) of hybrid abalone (Haliotis laevigata x H. rubra) after four months of acclimation to three protein levels (32, 38 and 44%) at three culture temperatures (12, 17 and 22 C-degrees). Hybrid abalone exhibited significant stepwise increases in meal size as temperature increased from 12 through to 22 C-degrees, contributing to significantly different SDA between the temperature treatments. Resting (standard) aerobic metabolic rate and peak metabolism (peak MO2 ) during SDA both increased with temperature, while SDA duration was lowest at 17 C-degrees. No effect of dietary protein was observed within the temperature treatments for the SDA metrics. Abalone held at 12 C-degrees exhibited significantly higher rates of gonad maturation, particularly among females. When 22 C-degrees-acclimated abalone were exposed to a simulated summer heatwave up to 26(degrees)C, they exhibited similar mortality and metabolic responses across protein treatment groups and there was a trend of steadily decreasing MO2 with sustained 26 C-degrees water temperature, probably due to fasting.

With its widespread culture, high temperature has become a key abiotic factor for the high mortality of Pacific abalone in summer, particularly in the south of China.

These DEGs were significantly enriched in protein folding and chaperone-mediated protein folding process, antigen processing and presentation, and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathways. The expression of numerous molecular chaperones was significantly upregulated after thermal stress. Maintaining cellular homeostasis through the upregulated expression of molecular chaperones associated with endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways might be central to the defense of Pacific abalone against thermal stress.

Two TPxs were isolated from a disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) cDNA library, named as AbTPx1 and AbTPx2, respectively. AbTPx1 and AbTPx2 consist of 1315 and 1045 bp full-length cDNA with 753 and 597 bp open reading frames encoding 251 and 199 amino acids, respectively. The TPx signature motif 1 (FYPLDFFFVCPTEI) and motif 2 (GEVCPA) were conserved in both AbTPx1 and AbTPx2 amino acid sequences. Purified recombinant abalone TPx fusion proteins catalyzed the reduction of H2O2 and butyl hydroperoxide in peroxidase assays. Furthermore, both AbTPx fusion proteins were shown to protect super-coiled DNA from damage by metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) in vitro. Escherichia coli cells transformed with AbTPx1 and AbTPx2 coding sequences in pMAL-c2x showed resistance to H2O2 at 0.8 mM concentration by in vivo H2O2 tolerance assay. AbTPx1 and AbTPx2 mRNA were constitutively expressed in gill, mantle, abductor muscle and digestive tract in a tissue specific manner. Additionally, both TPxs mRNA were up-regulated in gill and digestive tract tissues against H2O2 at 3 h post injection. The results indicate that AbTPx1 and AbTPx2 gene expressions are induced by oxidative stress and their respective proteins function in the detoxification of different ROS molecules to maintain efficient antioxidant defense in disk abalone.

The food with the greatest mean daily consumption in wet weight was the sea star with 24.03 +/- 2.69 g, followed by fish (11.36 +/- 3.74 g), shrimp (9.52 +/- 1.21 g) and squid (736 +/- 2.16 g). Absorption rate was higher when squid was consumed (97.1 +/- 3.7%, dry weight) followed by shrimp (93.5 +/- 4%), fish (87.8 +/- 8.6%) and sea star (45 +/- 15.3%). Although squid absorption was higher, due to high consumption rates against sea star and fish, energy input did not differ significantly. Tritons absorbed a large proportion of ash only when consuming sea star. Results indicate that C seguenzae can adapt well in captivity conditions by efficiently digesting alternative foods. Furthermore, a low metabolism is indicated by its low transit that needs 6 to 8 days to digest food consumed from a single feeding. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The growing industry has led to increased intensification. Farms are concentrated in certain areas, notably Hermanus on the South coast, and may be close to wild abalone populations and processing facilities. These factors contribute to increased risk of disease emergence. Data on parasite prevalence generated from the abalone health management program between 2000 and 2004 was analysed for trends. Abalone were sampled systematically from participating farms and subjected to gross and histological examination. Data on age, size, gonad development, diet and type of system were recorded. This paper presents the most significant results for gut protozoa, digestive gland protozoa and rickettsia like prokaryotes. which are all gut associated. Prevalence was found to increase with increasing age and size. Higher parasite prevalences were found on the West coast than on the South coast, and outside Hermanus compared to within Hermanus, suggesting that concentration of farms is not leading to increased prevalence. Gut associated parasites were significantly more prevalent in animals fed on kelp than artificial feed. It was found that animals younger than 24 months are more at risk of infection when fed kelp than older animals. The results indicate that separation of age groups, removal of poor performers and use of artificial feed, especially in younger animals, are likely to reduce risk of infection with gut associated parasites.

Seventy percent survival was obtained during larval rearing. Larvae passed trochophore, veliger, gliding and creeping stages and were induced to settle on a mat of diatoms containing Nitszchia sp. and Navicula sp. The larval rearing period of H. varia ranged from 4 to 6 days at 27 degreesC. The settled spat vigorously fed on the diatom mat until the 50th day of postfertilisation and coralline red algal film, until the 70th day of postfertilisation.

C. sublittoralis can grow well in a range of light intensities (830-1,217 lux) and is thus Suited for the changing light conditions in a commercial abalone nursery. Achnanthes longipes grows well under high light conditions (1,412-4,400 lux) at low (18 degrees C) and high (25 degrees C) temperatures indicating that this species is more suited to culture in unshaded tanks and higher in the water Column, Oil plates closer to the water surface. Cocconeis sublittoralis and Navicula cf. jeffreyi were cultured together to investigate competitive interactions between the two species. Throughout the experiment Navicula cf. jeffreyi was significantly higher in cell density when grown separately compared with the combined Culture with C. sublittoralis. However when considering cell Volume C. sublittoralis is substantially larger with a Cell Volume of 20,183 mu m(3) compared with 367 mu m(3) for N. cf. jeffreyi. Thus the cell density of N. cf. jeffreyi must be around 4 times higher than C. sublittoralis to achieve similar biomass, N. cf. jeffreyi which was only the case at the start of the experiment. Hence N. cf. jeffreyi is a pioneer species (early colonizer) whereas C. sublittoralis is likely to eventually out compete N. cf. jeffreyi. Cocconeis sublittoralis is a suitable diatom species for commercial abalone nurseries, particularly when larger photophobic juveniles (+5 mm shell length) are cultured and shading is often necessary. The percentage of protein was significantly higher in N. cf. jeffreyi in comparison with the other two species whereas A. longipes contained significantly higher percentage lipid. At a commercial scale juvenile abalone were successfully maintained on diatom diets for at least 18 wk (to ca. 8 mm in SL) after which growth slowed.

The biomass of these later two species was lowest overall because of the small cell volume of N. cf. jeffreyi and low cell density of A. longipes. Shell length reached 10.71 +/- 3.58 and 10.42 +/- 3.71 mm in the C. sublittoralis and mixed diatom treatments, respectively.

Results showed that the mortality reached 57% for individuals exposed to 1125 mu g L-1 of Al, and the abalone growth significantly decreased for an Al concentration greater than 495 mu g L-1. At the highest exposure concentration, intake rate measurements revealed that the appetite of abalones was affected, supported by the large increase in the conversion rate which was indicative of a poor feed efficiency. The monitoring of metallic concentrations showed that H. tuberculata strongly bioconcentrated Al relative to zinc. The diet did not appear to be the primary pathway for metal entry.

The complete nucleotide sequence of the hsp90 gene contains an open reading frame of 2,184 base pairs, encoding an 84 kDa protein. Disk abalone hsp90 shares high sequence similarity with other hsp90 family proteins. Although the phylogenetic analysis did not classify it into the hsp90 alpha group, the inductivity of this gene was confirmed by heat shock and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge test. Disk abalone hsp90 gene displayed a rapid and reversible induction response to both an exposure of typical heat shock and the LPS challenge. Once given the sublethal heat shock treatment, the transcription of disk abalone hsp90 gene was significantly up-regulated. With a recovery of 12 h, the transcription of disk abalone hsp90 gene gradually attenuated to the control level. These observations reflected the feedback regulation of abalone heat shock responses faithfully. In response to LPS challenge, the transcription of disk abalone hsp90 gene was significantly increased within 2 h and it approached maximum induction at 4 h later and recovered finally the reference level in 24 h.

Here, we monitor health of the model coral Acropora millepora adjacent to a high-use and an unused reef-based tourist platform, plus a nearby control site without a platform, over 7 months spanning a typical austral summer. Comparisons of temporal patterns in a range of biochemical and genetic immune parameters (Toll-like receptor signalling pathway, lectin-complement system, prophenoloxidase-activating system and green fluorescent protein-like proteins) among healthy, injured and diseased corals revealed that corals exhibit a diverse array of immune responses to environmental and anthropogenic stressors. In healthy corals at the control site, expression of genes involved in the Toll-like receptor signalling pathway (MAPK p38, MEKK1, cFos and ATF4/5) and complement system (C3 and Bf) was modulated by seasonal environmental factors in summer months. Corals at reef platform sites experienced additional stressors over the summer, as evidenced by increased expression of various immune genes, including MAPK p38 and MEKK1. Despite increased expression of immune genes, signs of white syndromes were detected in 31% of study corals near tourist platforms in the warmest summer month. Evidence that colonies developing disease showed reduced expression of genes involved in the complement pathway prior to disease onset suggests that their immune systems may have been compromised. Responses to disease and physical damage primarily involved the melanization cascade and GFP-like proteins, and appeared to be sufficient for recovery when summer heat stress subsided.

Density and food were manipulated to test their interacting effects on the growth and survival of hatchery produced postlarval Haliotis rubra. Feeding and dispersive behavior was also examined. Initial densities ranged between the densities used in aquaculture and those reported in the natural environment. Higher initial density increased the mortality rates of postlarvae in two experiments. Simultaneous manipulation of diatom food supply and density showed that the effect of density on mortality was mostly independent of food. Growth was strongly related to food supply, but also significantly reduced by high initial density, and these effects were additive. When diatom density was low, postlarvae did not increase rasping rates so the effect was that food was consumed more slowly. This explains the strong effect of food supply on growth. No aggressive interactions between feeding postlarvae were observed, but they graze intensively, leaving small distinct patches that have been cleared of algal food. Postlarvae encountering patches without food move rapidly and apparently randomly in search of food. The dispersal rate of postlarvae increased with density, presumably because post larvae spent more time searching for food. This searching is likely to be energetically expensive. and would increase at high densities because more cleared patches are created. This may explain why high initial densities of postlarvae had persistent reduced growth even when food was abundant, but does not explain the increased mortality at high density irrespective of food supply. We hypothesize that this effect may be attributable to other factors, such as the increased transmission of a pathogen at high density.",,"Day, Robert/0000-0001-5913-2292",0730-8000,1943-6319,,DEC,,

A large marine gastropod, Haliotis tuberculata, was exposed to ambient (pHT 8.0) or low pH (pHT 7.7) during a 5-month experiment. Because animal fitness can be affected through various behavioural changes, a broad spectrum of behavioural parameters was investigated, including situations involving no stress, responses to predators, righting to evaluate indirectly the level of energy reserves, and finally, reproductive behaviour. In addition, we measured the expression profile of the GABA A-like and serotonin receptor genes, often described as central neuromodulators of sensory performance and behaviour and known to be affected by OA in molluscs. No significant effect of low pH as compared to ambient pH was observed on abalone behaviour for any of these behavioural traits or gene expressions after either one week or several months of exposure to OA. The significance tests were corroborated by estimating the size of pH effects. The behaviour of this mollusc appears not to be affected by pH decrease expected by the end of the century, suggesting some resilience of the species to OA at the adult stage.

Both AbGrxs share typical thioredoxin/Grx structures. AbGrx1-like and AbGrx2 were identified as monothiol and diothiol Grxs, respectively. AbGrxs were significantly expressed at the egg and 16-cell stage of early abalone development.

In contrast, AbGrx2 expression was significantly higher than that of AbGrx1-like in adult tissues. Highest AbGrx1-like expression was observed in the hepatopancreas and digestive tract, while highest AbGrx2 expression was found in the gills, followed by the mantle, in healthy adult abalone tissues.

Controlled mating experiments between O- and G-type abalones demonstrated apparent Mendelian segregations (1:1 or 3:1) in shell colors in F(2) families, which support the notion that the O- and G-types are under strict genetic control at a single locus With a recessive o (for orange shell) allele and a dominant G (for green shell) allele. Feeding with different diets caused modifications of shell color within each genotype, ranging from orange to yellow for O-type and green to dark-brown for the G-type, without affecting the distinction between genotypes.

There is also increasing evidence for a pathogenic role of iron in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which may progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. Mouse models of hereditary hemochromatosis and NAFLD can be used to explore potential interactions between iron and lipid metabolic pathways.

The aim of the present study was to determine the antioxidant activity and oxidative stressoriented apoptosis pathway in saccharides supplemented cryopreserved sperm of Pacific abalone. Cryopreserved sperm showed impaired antioxidant defenses due to the reduced mRNA abundance of antioxidant genes (CAT, Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, GPx, GR, and BCL-2), apoptosis inhibitor (HSP70, and HSP90) gene, and enzymatic antioxidant activity compared to fresh sperm. Such impaired antioxidant defenses caused an increase in the mRNA expression of apoptosis genes (Bax, and Caspase-3), finally leading to apoptosis. The impaired antioxidant defense also increased O(2)(center dot-)production and lipid peroxidation (MDA) levels, which further accelerated apoptosis. Considering all the experimental findings, an apoptosis pathway of cryopreserved sperm has been adopted for the first time.

Consequently, this study will investigate the process of vitamin D-3/VDR regulating NF-kappa B pathway and further explore their functions on inflammation, autophagy, and apoptosis in abalone Haliotis discus hannai. Results showed that knockdown of VDR by using siRNA and dsRNA of VDR in vitro and in vivo led to more intense response of NF-kappa B signaling to lipopolysaccharide and higher level of apoptosis and autophagy. In addition, 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 stimulation after VDR silencing could partially alleviate apoptosis and induce autophagy. Overexpression of VDR restricted the K48-polyubiquitin chain-dependent inhibitor of kappa B (I kappa B) ubiquitination and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) oligomerization. Besides, VDR silencing resulted in increase of ASC speck formation. In further mechanistic studies, we showed that VDR can directly bind to I kappa B and IKK1 in vitro and in vivo.

In summary, abalone VDR plays a negative regulator role in NF-kappa B-mediated inflammation via interacting with I kappa B and inhibiting ubiquitin-dependent degradation of I kappa B.

The 2163-bp cDNA contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1878 bp, a 42-bp 5'-untranslated region (UTR), and a 243-bp 3'-UTR including a stop codon (TAG), a poly A tail, and a putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) 14 bp upstream of the poly A tail. The ORF encoded a protein of 626 amino acids (aa) with a predicted molecular mass of 71.3 kDa and an estimated pI of 5.55. The grouper Mx sequence contained putative functional domains including a tripartite guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding motif (GDQSSGKS, DLPG, and TKPD), the signature of the dynamin family (LPRGSGIVTR), and a putative leucine zipper in the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein. Sequence comparison showed that the Mx gene of this grouper had overall respective identities of 70%-96%, 51%-56%, and 34% to those of teleosts, mammals, and the abalone (Haliotis discus discus), respectively. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that the cloned Mx (TGMx) from tiger grouper was more-correlated with orange-spotted grouper MxII (gMxII). TGMx was constitutively expressed in all tissues, and its expression was upregulated by poly I: C and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), especially after a poly I: C injection. The Mx expressions had significantly increased in the eyes, head kidney, spleen, intestines, liver and gills after the LPS injection, and in all tested tissues after the poly I: C injection as compared to the groupers injected with PBS. The quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that Mx mRNA expression in the spleen and head kidney of grouper fed a diet containing sodium alginate and then injected with poly I: C after 12 h significantly increased, compared to those of fish fed a control diet (without sodium alginate). We therefore recommend an LPS and poly I: C injection to induce TGMx expression which was further enhanced by dietary sodium alginate administration. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This study compared the pathologic changes that occur during the progression of WS in red abalone to those caused by environmental stresses consisting of elevated temperature and food limitation and determined the impact of these stressors on WS prevalence and intensity. Farmed red abalone were administered a feed-based oxytetracycline therapeutic treatment to assure WS-RLP-free status prior to initiation of the experiment. Groups were then held in each of eight combinations of exposed vs. unexposed to WS-RLP, elevated vs. ambient temperature, and high vs. low food supply, for 447 days. Mortality was associated with starvation and disease but not elevated temperature alone. Elevated temperature significantly affected WS-RLP transmission: only 1.7% of WS-RLP-exposed abalone held at ambient temperature (12.3 degrees C) became infected compared to at least 72% of those held at elevated temperature (18.7 degrees C). Among exposed abalone at elevated temperature, fed animals exhibited greater infection prevalence but not greater infection intensity or digestive gland changes than starved animals, suggesting that abalone acquire infections by ingesting contaminated food. Food, temperature, WS-RLP exposure, and most of their interactions had significant effects on body condition and foot atrophy. Immunohistochemical detection of cell proliferation and apoptosis revealed no differences between normal digestive gland and that infected with WS-RLP. Body mass shrinkage, foot atrophy, elevated mortality, and decreased foot and digestive gland glycogen were observed in both WS-affected and starved, unexposed abalone, with the WS-RLP-exposed, starved group held at elevated temperature faring worst. Among exposed and unexposed animals, food Supply but not temperature affected body mass and growth. These data demonstrate that the high morbidity and mortality exhibited by WS-RLP-infected abalone is a consequence of disease and not direct thermal stress. Drug residue analysis indicated oxytetracycline concentrations of up to 600 ppm in the digestive gland at 38 days post-treatment, an unusual degree of tissue retention of this therapeutant.

These stressful conditions lead to hyperglycemia and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in oxidative stress and subsequent cell damage in the organism. To understand the role of insulin-related peptides in the regulation of elevated hemolymph glucose, hyperglycemia was confirmed in abalone under high water temperature and air (emersion) exposure (p < 0.05). To prove the existence of a glucose regulatory system in abalone, changes in hemolymph glucose were measured after bovine insulin injection, and hemolymph glucose was lowered by bovine insulin injection in hyperglycemia caused by both stressors (p < 0.05), supporting the existence of a glucose regulatory system functionally similar to that of vertebrates. Among the three abalone insulin-related peptides (AIPs), which were previously reported to be upregulated along with hemolymph glucose levels upon feeding, the relative mRNA expression of AIP2 in the cerebral ganglion showed a close correlation with high water temperature and emersion stress, which peaked 12 h after treatment (p < 0.05). Based on these results, we focused on the function of AIP2 in glucose homeostasis and characterized the localization of AIP2 mRNA-expressing cells in the cerebral ganglion using in situ hybridization. Positive signals from RNA probes were detected in neural cortex cells in the cerebral ganglion. Furthermore, suppressing AIP2 mRNA expression using RNA interference with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) revealed that dsRNA-AIP2 injected abalone maintained high hemolymph glucose levels after 24 h of recovery following 1 h of emersion stress (p < 0.01). In contrast, abalones that received dsRNA-GFP and molluscan saline showed relatively rapid clearance of hemolymph glucose. This study demonstrates that AIP2 gene expression affects the recovery rate from emersion stress-induced hyperglycemia by regulating hemolymph glucose.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.741161,,0044-8486,1873-5622,,Nov-15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.741161,

A de novo transcriptome assembly with subsequent quantitative PCR and correlation network analysis of genes involved in the molecular response were used to unravel the correlations between gene expression patterns under the different experimental conditions. The correlation networks identified a shift from the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism (down-regulated) to the up-regulation of Hsp70 during warming under all experimental conditions in gill and muscle, indicating a strong up-regulation of damage prevention and repair systems at sustained cellular energy production. However, a higher capacity for anaerobic succinate production was evicted in gill, matching with observations from our previous studies indicating succinate accumulation in gill but not in muscle.

After 8 weeks, yellow catfish (initial weight: 2.12 +/- A 0.01 g) fed isonitrogenous and isolipid diets containing < 0.05 (deficient dietary Se) or 6.5 (excess dietary Se) mg Se/kg displayed a significantly lower weight gain ratio (WGR) than those fed a diet containing 0.23 (normal dietary Se) mg Se/kg. As dietary Se levels increased, liver Se concentration, glutathione peroxidase activity and the hepatosomatic index increased significantly. Plasma glucose concentration was highest in the normal treatment compared with the excess dietary Se treatment. Both deficient and excess dietary Se lead to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis ratio in blood cells, whereas only excess dietary Se increased their cytoplasmic free-Ca2+ (CF-Ca2+) concentration. Excess dietary Se also resulted in the highest level of HSP70 expression, thereby possibly providing a protective mechanism against oxidative stress. These results indicate that both deficient and excess dietary Se restrained the growth of juvenile yellow catfish and caused oxidative stress. The overproduction of ROS may act as a signal molecule mediate apoptosis when dietary Se deficiency. Both ROS and CF-Ca2+ were recorded when dietary Se excess, suggesting that Ca2+ may be activated by Se and play a major role during Se-induced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis.",10.1007/s10695-015-0133-y,,0920-1742,1573-5168,,FEB,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-015-0133-y,26394863

The distribution of abalone during daytime was closely related to the availability of preferred shelter space. The percentage of abalone stacked on the top of others increased with density. Preferred shelter space was characterized by low light intensity and a corner or edge for the abalone to rest against. Hides at the ends of the tanks were not occupied as much as others. Abalone were found crawling on the side of the tank during daytime when tanks were shaded. Abalone juveniles of 15-60 mm showed fidelity to their resting shelter during daytime but this fidelity was significantly reduced at the higher density.

The full-length cDNA of abLysl consisted of 545 bp with an open reading frame of 393 bp that encodes 131 amino acids. The theoretical molecular mass of mature abLysI was 12.3 kDa with an isoelectric point of 8.03. Conserved features in other homologs, such as catalytic sites for lytic activity (Glu(30) and Asp(41)), isopeptidase activity (His(107)), and ten cysteine residues were identified in abLysl. Genomic sequence analysis with respect to its cDNA showed that abLysl was organized into four exons interrupted by three introns. Several immune-related transcription factor binding sites were discovered in the putative promoter region. Homology and phylogeny analysis of abLysl depicted high identity and closer proximity, respectively, with an annelid i-type lysozyme from Hirudo medicinalis, and indicated that abLysI is a novel molluscan i-type lysozyme. Tissue-specific expressional studies revealed that abLysl is mainly transcribed in hepatopancreas followed by mantle.

Wild and cultured abalone both attract premium prices, but generally this is not based on sensory characteristics. Yet, abalone aquaculture is developing to provide an alternative to a dwindling supply of wild abalone, and this provides an opportunity to optimize the sensory properties if they are better understood. In most natural food products, farming practices and growing environment are responsible for the sensory properties of the final product; therefore, the comparison of both wild and aquacultured abalone's sensory characteristics could contribute to a better understanding of the impact of the growing and farming practices on the sensory properties. Our study focused on the development of a descriptive sensory analysis methodology to measure abalone sensory properties, and the observation of differences among the abalone sampled. Wild and aquacultured abalone were prepared according to a standardized cooking protocol. A sensory panel of trained assessors developed and defined a descriptive vocabulary and a method of assessment, and then quantified the sensory properties of abalone. A vocabulary of 16 terms describing aroma, texture, flavor, and aftertaste of the abalone was developed. Very significant differences were found between abalone sourced from the wild and aquacultured abalone from different sources. The wild-caught blacklip abalone, which were larger in size, were perceived as more firm, springy, and chewy, but also rated significantly higher in aroma, flavor, and aftertaste impact as well as earthy and metallic flavors. Significant differences in sensory properties were also found between cultured abalone fed different diets. Compositional analysis showed significant differences between abalone in their content of glycogen (range, 4.8% 23.2% of dry weight (DW)), moisture (69.4% 73.7% live weight), and taste-active free amino acids, especially glycine (3.4-18.2 mg/g DW) and glutamate (1.0-3.6 mg/g DW). Correlations were found between sensory attributes and some chemical compounds. This study indicates that growing conditions as well as growing techniques may have a large influence on abalone sensory characteristics.

In these systems fish is cultured next to other organisms, which are converting otherwise discharged nutrients into valuable products. These conversions are analyzed based on nitrogen and phosphorous balances using a mass balance approach. The analytical concept of this review comprises a hypothetical system design with five modules: (1) the conversion of feed nutrients into fish biomass, the Fish-Biomass-Converter; (2) the separation of solid and dissolved fish waste/nutrients; the Fish-Waste-Processor; (3) the conversion of dissolved fish waste/nutrients, the Phototrophic-herbivore-Converter; (4 and 5) the conversion of solid fish waste, the Bacterial-Waste-Converter, or the Detrivorous-Converter. In the reviewed examples, fish culture alone retains 20-50% feed nitrogen (N) and 15-65% feed phosphorous (P). The combination of fish culture with phototrophic conversion increases nutrient retention of feed N by 15-50% and feed P by up to 53%. If in addition herbivore consumption is included, nutrient retention decreases by 60-85% feed N and 50-90% feed P. This is according to the general observation of nutrient losses from one trophic level to the next. The conversion of nutrients into bacteria and detrivorous worm biomass contributes only in smaller margins (e.g. 7% feed N and 6% feed P and 0.06% feed N 0.03 x 10(-3)% feed P, respectively). All integrated modules have their specific limitations, which are related to uptake kinetics, nutrient preference, unwanted conversion processes and abiotic factors. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In the natural environment, abalone larvae settle on coralline red algae, which provide one of the strongest and most consistent settlement cues available for abalone larvae. However. propagation of coralline red algae is not practical commercially. Abalone farms in Japan successfully settle abalone larvae (Haliotis discus hannai) on the green alga Ulvella lens. U. lens also proved to be Suitable to enhance settlement of cultured southern Australian abalone species (Haliotis laevigata. H. rubra). Most abalone farms in Australia are now growing U. lens for that purpose. U. lens is easy to culture. no specific facilities are needed and the alga can be grown on PVC settlement plates in commercial nursery tanks. However, U. lens has limited value as a feed for young postlarvae. Instead. cultured diatoms can be added after larvae successfully settle and start feeding. Juvenile abalone (> 3 mm in shell length) can consume U. lens and grow rapidly on this alga. Diatom cultures and biofilms developing on settlement plates are not axenic and the role of bacteria in early postlarvae feeding is poorly understood. It has been suggested that bacteria may perform metabolic activities in the undeveloped gut of young postlarvae. At later stages of the nursery phase it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain adequate feed on the plates and this is still regarded as a significant bottleneck for the abalone aquaculture industry. Recent investigations have indicated that sporelings of macroalgae like Ulva sp. or diatoms that can provide more biomass may provide a suitable additional food source for juveniles (> 3 mm in shell length).",10.2983/0730-8000(2006)25[151:TROBAM]2.0.CO;2,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,APR,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/0730-8000(2006)25[151:TROBAM]2.0.CO;2,

This article describes the threats from infectious diseases in aquaculture and then focuses on one example (QX disease in Sydney rock oysters) as a case study. QX appears to be typical of many emerging diseases in aquaculture, particularly because environmental factors seem to play a crucial role in disease outbreaks.

In recent years, the frequent occurrence of the disease has led to significant mortality in abalone farms. Deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 (DMBT1), a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) protein family, plays an important role in host defense. However, its function in H. diversicolor remains unknown. In order to evaluate the immune priming effect after secondary infection and elucidate possible regulatory mechanism, a novel DMBT1 from the small abalone H. diversicolor (designated as HdDMBT1) was cloned and characterized in this study. The open reading frame of HdDMBT1 was 2331 bp encoding 776 amino acids with a molecular weight of 84.73 kDa. HdDMBT1 contained conserved active sites with DMBT1 from other species, detected in all tested tissues and had higher expression levels in hepatopancreas. The temporal expression profiles of HdDMBT1 after two challenges of Vibrio harveyi were examined to evaluate priming response in the small abalone. The expression level of HdDMBT1 mRNA in hepatopancreas increased significantly after V. harveyi challenge. Meanwhile, the expression level of HdDMBT1 after the second challenge was significantly higher than that after the first challenge (4.23-fold). RNA interference (RNAi) experiments were conducted to examine the role of HdDMBT1 in response to V. harveyi infection. Knocking down HdDMBT1 decreased the hemocytes phagocytosis (0.48-fold). In addition, the bacterial density in hemolymph and the mortality of abalone raised, when infected with V. harveyi after dsHdDMBT1 injection.

In the second experiment we have measured the effects of two different settlement substrates, combined with the presence of conspecifics, onmetamorphosis, survival and growth of post-larvae. The microalgae dietary treatments consisted in: Dunaliella tertiolecta (Duna); 50% mixture of Isochrysis galbana and D. tertiolecta (ID); 50% mixture of Chaetoceros gracilis and D. tertiolecta (CD); 33% mixture of I. galbana, C. gracilis and D. tertiolecta (ICD). Although all dietary treatments resulted in a good survival at competence, significant difference in post-larval survival was observed between treatments, and indeed, only larvae fed Duna and CD survived to 180 days post settlement (DPS). In the second experiment, the settlement substrates consisted in a film of cultured Ulvella lens or a naturally developing biofilm of diatoms, and the employed rearing water was either natural seawater or seawater previously exposed to P. lividus adults. At 10 DPS, larger (p < 0.05) post-larvae were observed in the natural biofilm treatment, whilst the presence of conspecifics significantly increased larval settlement in both substrates (p < 0.01). These results indicate that it is important to consider the survival of post-larvae and juveniles to establish the efficiency of the dietary treatment on the hatchery production of P. lividus. Furthermore, it suggests that improved settlement protocols, such as the use of conspecifics, could contribute to increase hatchery outputs. Finally, it confirms the suitability of U. lens as settlement cue but also highlights that further research is required to establish its effectiveness for post-larvae first feeding.

Traditionally, abalone farmers have used a combination of UV irradiation and application of temperature gradients to the tank water to artificially induce spawning. Proteins are known to regulate crucial processes such as respiration, muscle contraction, feeding, growth and reproduction. Spawning as a pre-requisite of abalone reproduction is likely to be regulated, in part, by endogenous proteins. A first step in elucidating the mechanisms that regulate spawning is to identify which proteins are directly involved during spawning. The present study examined protein expression following traditional spawning induction in the Haliotis laevigata female. Gonads were collected from abalone in the following physiological states: (1) spawning; (2) post-spawning; and (3) failed-to-spawn. Differential protein abundance was initially assessed using two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry for protein identification. A number of reproductive proteins such as vitellogenin, vitelline envelope zona pellucida domain 29 and prohibitin, and metabolic proteins such as thioredoxin peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and heat shock proteins were identified. Differences in protein abundance levels between physiological states were further assessed using scheduled multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. Positive associations were observed between the abundance of specific proteins, such as heat shock cognate 70 and peroxiredoxin 6, and the propensity or failure to spawn in abalone. These findings have contributed to better understand both the effects of oxidative and heat stress over abalone physiology and their influence on abalone spawning.

This research makes a case for the use of the randomized response technique (RRT) as a tool to inform conservation policy with respect to regulatory compliance. RRT was used to generate estimates of non-compliance in the Northern California recreational red abalone (Winds rufescens) fishery before and after the introduction of new tagging regulations and marine protected areas (MPAs). Anonymous paper-based compliance and sociodemographic surveys were conducted with recreational fishers in Sonoma and Mendocino Counties in August of 2007 and 2011. The 2011 survey found reductions in illegal take across most violation types, and since the introduction of on-animal tagging regulations the proportional daily take limit violation among local residents was found to have decreased from 72% to 43%. The results indicate higher non-compliance rates among visitors than local fishers regarding licensing laws, minimum size limits, and annual catch limits. Locals were proportionately more likely to violate the daily catch limit and the new regulations, though 85% of the fishers surveyed were aware of them. The rule-specific violation estimates RRT generates provide managers with a level of detail about non-compliant behavior that is unique, and can point to opportunities for improving managerial communication and enforcement.

Survival was highest (80%) in the treatment without water flow and with light, whereas the lowest (52%) corresponded to the 600-mL/min flow rate under darkness, but these differences were not significant. Initial grazing rate was significantly higher in darkness than in light (37 cell/pl/hr, SE = 1.6, and 27 cell/pl/hr, SE = 2.8, respectively). Growth rate was not significantly affected by the light treatments. However, in static conditions growth was higher in darkness (38-mu m/day, SE = 2.0) than in light (34-mu m/day, SE = 1.0).

However, the flow rates tested here were apparently too high to allow an optimal postlarval growth and slower flows should be tested in future experiments. On the other hand, flow allowed the development of high diatom densities under the light condition, which were difficult to maintain in darkness.",10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[789:EODAWF]2.0.CO;2,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,SEP,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[789:EODAWF]2.0.CO;2,

Various combinations of red algae (Palmaria palmata, Ceramium rubrum and Chondrus crispus cultured or harvested from the natural environment, as well as Porphyra spp. collected), brown algae (Laminaria digitata) and green algae (fresh or frozen Ulva intestinalis) were tested. The results showed that P. palmata, C. rubrum and U. intestinalis administered alone were associated with significantly higher weight growth rates than the other species of algae tested. However, some combinations of algae (i.e. different proportions of L. digitata in association with P palmata) were more favorable for weight increase when compared with the expected rates calculated for the diet based on L. digitata alone. Limiting the amount of any of these foods substantially reduced the conversion rate. Seasonal trends were apparent in both weight increase and food conversion rates, with the result that growth in weight on a diet of L. digitata was fastest in summer. Growth on P. palmata was faster in each season, and reached a maximum in early spring. The data collected allowed us to model weight increase and month-to-month food conversion rates for a diet based on P. palmata and L. digitata. The data obtained in this study were coupled with data regarding the availability of algae during the year, enabling us to suggest an optimal diet for each of the four seasons. Finally, the effects of different algae diets were investigated on hemocyte parameters, and the result suggested that P. palmata would reinforce the immune system of abalone.",10.1051/alr/2018018,"Serpentini, Antoine/0009-0002-2540-1073",0990-7440,1765-2952,,Oct-10,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/alr/2018018,

Numerous studies have reported the crucial role of caveolin-1 (CAV1) in response to invading microbes; yet, very little is known about molluscan CAV1. In this study, we identified and characterized CAV1 ortholog from the disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus (HdCAV1). The cDNA sequence of HdCAV1 is 826 bp long and encodes a 127-amino acid polypeptide. Characteristic caveolin superfamily domain (Glu(3) - Lys(126)) and two possible transmembrane domains (Cys(48) - Tyr(67) and Ile(103) - Phe(120)) were identified in the HdCAV1 protein. Homology analysis revealed that HdCAV1 shared higher identity (>47%) with molluscans, but lower identity with other species. Phylogenetic tree constructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method revealed a distinct evolutionary pathway for molluscans. Transcriptional analysis by SYBR Green qPCR showed the highest expression of HdCAV1 mRNA in late veliger stage, as compared to that in other embryonic developmental stages of disk abalone. In adult animals, gill tissue showed highest HdCAV1 transcript levels under normal physiological condition. Stimulations with two bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes), viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, and two pathogen-associated molecular patterns (LPS and poly I:C) significantly modulated the expression of HdCAV1 transcripts.

The combined effect of low frequency climatic variability and anthropogenic perturbations can have dramatic consequences for abalone in southern California. Abalone species are tightly linked to kelp forest ecosystems that, besides furnishing habitat, also provide the main food source for abalone. In southern California, kelp canopies are very sensitive to oceanographic climate because the kelp depend upon high nutrients in the water column. Oceanic warming, in turn, results in decreased nutrients in the surface water, and this is correlated with marked reductions in giant kelp biomass. Here we address the additive effects of ocean warming on two species of California abalone (the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens; and the green abalone, H.fulgens) by subjecting them to varied environmental conditions similar to cool, normal, and warm phases of the California current in the southern California Bight. Our experimental design simultaneously tested the synergistic effects of temperature and food quantity and quality on survivorship, growth, and reproduction. For red abalone, warm temperatures increased the onset of withering syndrome, a fatal abalone disease, and halted growth and reproduction. In contrast, green abalone survivorship, growth, and reproduction were relatively robust irrespective of temperature, while their growth and reproduction were most strongly influenced by food quantity. We found clear evidence suggesting that, combined with overfishing, California abalone populations are adversely affected by ecosystem responses to ocean warming: Coolwater red abalone suffer stronger consequences in warm water than do green abalone. Conservation, restoration, and recovery plans of remnant California abalone populations must consider these relationships when taking any action.",10.1890/03-5326,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,APR,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/03-5326,

Dense populations are characterized by high levels of intraspecific secondary substratum use (stacking) for attachment surfaces, though it is rare in low density areas. Use of shell surfaces by black abalone appears not to be an evolved adaptive strategy. Individuals in stacks fed significantly more than expected, yet solitary abalone next to stacks shared food trapped by stacks. In the laboratory, starvation did not increase the propensity of an abalone to stack. Stacks were equally common in the breeding and non-breeding seasons, suggesting that stacking behavior was not a mechanism to enhance reproductive success. Stacking did not enhance avoidance of predators or competitors. Laboratory experiments showed that stacking is density dependent and probably the result of limitation of primary attachment space. Removals of significant predators (sea otters and Chumash Indians) of adult abalone during the past two centuries probably led to increased densities of black abalone, which in turn has had an indirect effect on the prevalence of stacking.",10.1016/0022-0981(87)90127-4,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,Jun-04,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-0981(87)90127-4,

All experiments were conducted under moderate to high artificial light of 24-52 mol photons m(-2) day(-1) and low seawater exchange (1 vol day(-1)), in order to minimize seawater pumping costs. Application of nutrients every 5-7 days resulted in no significant difference in P mollis growth compared with daily applications. Nutrient additions during the dark cycle compared with the light cycle were found to be effective in controlling epiphytes. The addition off medium trace metals (Gran. Can. J.

"Coyne, VE",The importance of ATP in the immune system of molluscs,2011,ISJ-INVERTEBRATE SURVIVAL JOURNAL,8,1,48,55,,"Molluscs rely on an innate immune system for defence against infection. Invading organisms are phagocytosed by circulating hemocytes and neutralised by a combination of hydrolytic enzymes and the production of reactive oxygen species. Phagocytosis, the central feature of the molluscan innate immune system, is an energy-demanding process as a consequence of actin polymerisation which requires a constant supply of ATP. Adenylate kinase, shown to couple local ATP supply and actomyosin assembly in macrophage cell lines, may play a similar role in molluscan hemocytes. Hemocyte conformational changes and chemotaxis are regulated via protein kinase C which is phosphorylated in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. ATP utilisation in protein kinase cascades is thought to be quite significant. The vast majority of the ATP required to support cellular functions in animal cells is generated via the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Disruption of this process with antimycin A resulted in a 50 % decrease in ATP levels in Haliotis midae hemocytes which also exhibited reduced phagocytic activity. Phosphoarginine and arginine kinase are thought to play a role in invertebrates that is similar to phosphocreatine and creatine kinase in vertebrates, by supplying additional ATP during periods of high energy demand. The energetically-expensive processes associated with the molluscan innate immune system, such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, formation and acidification of the phagolysosome, are severely compromised by abiotic stresses such as elevated water temperature and pollutants, reflecting the fine balance that must be maintained to ensure sufficient ATP is available for both general metabolism and the immune response.",,,1824-307X,,,,,

Under conditions of rapid growth, protein comprised a larger percent (66%) of a larva's organic biomass compared to similar-aged, slower-growing larvae (26%). Larvae fed at the highest food concentration tested (40 algal cells mu l(-1)) had a protein depositional efficiency of 80% (+/-16%), a value 3-fold higher than larvae fed 20 algal cells mu l(-1) (28%+/-11%). Also, faster-growing larvae required 3-fold less energy per unit mass of protein growth. Larvae fed 40 algal cells mu l(-1) deposited protein at a respiratory cost of 65+/-11 pmol O-2 h(-1) (mu g protein)(-1); larvae fed 20 algal cells mu l(-1) had a cost of 192+/-47 pmol O-2 h(-1) (mu g protein)(-1). While there were differences in the cost to deposit protein (i.e., protein growth, the balance of synthesis and degradation), there were no differences in the energetic cost of protein synthesis for all food concentrations tested. The energetic cost of protein synthesis was fixed at 13.8 (+/-0.92) Joules (mg protein synthesized)(-1) and was independent of developmental stage, growth rates, and large changes (58-fold) in protein synthesis rates. A major conclusion from this study is that larvae grown in high-food environments not only grew faster, but did so for considerably less energy. Defining the complex relationships of food availability and metabolic efficiency will provide more accurate predictions of larval growth under variable food conditions in the ocean.

Two macroalgal meals including Sargassum muticum (SM) and Gracilaria lemaneiformis (GL) and two lipid sources including fish oil (FO) and vegetable oil (VO) were formulated into four diets, i.e., S. muticum and fish oil (SF), S.muticum and vegetable oil (SV), G. lemaneiformis and fish oil (GF) and G. lemaneiformis and vegetable oil (GV). The results showed that the specific growth rates (SGR) of A. japonicus fed diets containing SM were significantly higher than those fed diets containing GL. No significant differences in SGR between the FO-based and VO-based groups were observed. Similar results were observed in the body wall lipid content. Most body wall FAs changed to resemble the dietary FA proportions because of the dietary effect. Concentrations of 20:4n-6 of the SF and GF groups were significantly lower than the SV and GV groups, while levels of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 were significantly higher than the SV and GV groups. The n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratios of the SF and GF groups were significantly higher than the SV and GV groups. Moreover, the SF group had significantly higher 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 contents and n-3/n-6 PUFAs ratio than the GF group.

One approach is to increase nitrogen reuse within the system by feeding nitrogen-rich aquaculture effluent to deposit feeders, thereby closing the aquaculture nitrogen-loop. This study, for the first time and on a laboratory-scale, has reared juveniles of the sea cucumber Holothuria scabra at high densities solely on particulate organic waste from a commercial-scale land-based abalone recirculating aquaculture system. Furthermore, growth rates and biomass yields were increased significantly by adjusting the effluent C:N from 5:1 to 20:1 by adding exogenous organic carbon sources (glucose, starch and cellulose), so fuelling accelerated heterotrophic bacterial production within the redox-stratified tank sediment. Sea cucumber juveniles reared solely on effluent had a biomass density of 711 gm(-2) after four months whereas animals reared on starch-amended effluent (the best performing treatment) had a final density of 1011 gm(-2). Further optimisation of this approach could increase biomass yields and pave the way for the commercial cultivation of deposit feeding animals on waste streams, thus contributing to more environmentally sustainable aquaculture. Here, the nitrogen that originated from fishmeal is not lost through the discharge of aquaculture effluent; rather, it is immobilised into single cell biomass that is up-cycled into high-value secondary biomass. We demonstrate that sea cucumbers can be produced at high density through the manipulation of the C:N ratio of aquaculture effluent.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.09.024,"Jones, Clifford/0000-0001-8394-1890; CALDWELL, GARY/0000-0001-5687-6894",0044-8486,1873-5622,,Jan-15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.09.024,

Natural recovery on San Nicolas Island (SNI) of Southern California suggested the development of resistance in island populations. Experimental challenges in one treatment demonstrated that progeny of disease-selected black abalone from SNI survived better than did those from naive black abalone from Carmel Point in mainland coastal central California. Unexpectedly, the presence of a newly observed bacteriophage infecting the WS rickettsia (WS-RLO) had strong effects on the survival of infected abalone. Specifically, presence of phage-infected RLO (RLOv) reduced the host response to infection, RLO infection loads, and associated mortality. These data suggest that the black abalone: WS-RLO relationship is evolving through dual host mechanisms of resistance to RLO infection in the digestive gland via tolerance to infection in the primary target tissue (the post-esophagus) coupled with reduced pathogenicity of the WS-RLO by phage infection, which effectively reduces the infection load in the primary target tissue by half. Sea surface temperature patterns off southern California, associated with a recent hiatus in global-scale ocean warming, do not appear to be a sufficient explanation for survival patterns in SNI black abalone. These data highlight the potential for natural recovery of abalone populations over time and that further understanding of mechanisms governing host parasite relationships will better enable us to manage declining populations.",10.3389/fmicb.2014.00078,,1664-302X,,,Mar-18,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00078,24672512

However, the biological efficacy of nano-selenium has not been comprehensively and accurately evaluated due to its dispersion instability. RESULTS In this study, novel selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) with high dispersion stability were successfully prepared using a polysaccharide-protein complex (PSP) as the capping agent. This was isolated from abalone viscera. The average particle size and zeta potential of polysaccharide-protein complex selenium nanoparticles (PSP-SeNPs) were 63.33 nm, and -37.1 mV, respectively. The SeNPs were firmly capped by PSP through Se-O and Se-N bonds, as demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Due to this capping, the dispersion of PSP-SeNPs remained stable for 12 months at 4 degrees C, as evidenced by visual inspection and multiple light scattering. Furthermore, PSP-SeNPs imparted an excellent growth-promoting effect on tilapia. The FBW, WGR, and SGR values of tilapia juveniles fed with PSP-SeNPs supplemented diets (0.5-4.5 mg/kg) were significantly higher than those of the control (P< 0.05). A weight gain rate of 4.1%-43.4% and specific growth rate of 0.15%-1.74% were obtained in tilapia during 45-day feeding. CONCLUSIONS The use of marine viscera polysaccharides is a promising, green method for the synthesis of selenium nanoparticles. There are good opportunities for the application of the synthesized PSP-SeNPs in the life sciences.

Shells were infested mainly by introduced Boccardia proboscidea. Polydora hoplura and Dipolydora capensis were also present but in numbers too few to identify factors influencing infestation. At both farms, B. proboscidea lived for a minimum of 12 months. Growth rate, size at maturity, maximum size, infestation intensity, recruitment, percentage of the population brooding and mortality appear to be affected by abalone feeding regime and water temperature, and these factors need to be considered in controlling infestation. Brooders and recruits were present throughout the year, but increased significantly during mid- to late winter/early spring when water temperature and day length increased.

The response of communities, driven by the direct effects of ocean change on individual species as well the cascade of indirect effects, has received far less study. We used several rocky intertidal species including crabs, whelks, juvenile abalone, and mussels to determine how feeding, growth, and interactions between species could be shifted by changing ocean conditions. Our 10 wk experiment revealed many complex outcomes which highlight the unpredictability of community-level responses. Contrary to our predictions, the largest impact of elevated CO2 was reduced crab feeding and survival, with a pH drop of 0.3 units. Surprisingly, whelks showed no response to higher temperatures or CO2 levels, while abalone shells grew 40 % less under high CO2 conditions. Massive non-consumptive effects of crabs on whelks showed how important indirect effects can be in deter mining climate change responses. Predictions of species outcomes that account solely for physiological responses to climate change do not consider the potentially large role of indirect effects due to species interactions. For strongly linked species (e.g. predator-prey or competitor relationships), the indirect effects of climate change are much less known than direct effects, but may be far more powerful in reshaping future marine communities.",10.3354/meps12148,"Lord, Joshua/0000-0003-3020-5704",0171-8630,1616-1599,,May-17,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps12148,

In an initial experiment conducted for 8 wk, shrimp were proffered a full or reduced ration (100%, 60%, and 20%) of commercial shrimp feed with or without access to sea urchin egesta serving as a source of supplemental nutrients and presumptive probiotics. Individual weight gain of shrimp provided sea urchin egesta only (10.37 +/- 0.35 g) did not differ significantly from that of shrimp proffered a full ration of feed (9.46 +/- 0.39 g) despite significant compositional differences. Consumption of sea urchin egesta combined with commercial shrimp feed resulted in significantly greater weight gain of shrimp when compared with shrimp proffered the same level of commercial shrimp feed only. The largest weight gains of shrimp were found for those groups fed rations of 60% and 100% and had access to egesta (14.09 +/- 0.75 g and 14.72 +/- 0.68 g, respectively). In the next experiment, shrimp were stocked at different densities (approximately 23, 45, 68, and 90 individuals m-2) and were not proffered feed directly. All replicates were provided access to fresh sea urchin egesta produced by four urchins that were fed at a daily rate of 3% of the total initial group weight (140.4 +/- 0.7 g) for 8 wk.

Here, we use suppression subtractive hybridization to identify expressed genes that may be linked to the control of growth and feeding in the tropical abalone Haliotis asinina. Two pools of suppression subtractive hybridization clones were obtained from messenger RNA derived from H. asinina cerebral and pleuropedal ganglia, corresponding to genes differentially expressed in (1) well-nourished animals relative to food-deprived ones and (2) well-nourished animals relative to reproductively active ones.

However, the misuse and overuse of antibiotics have led to the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes in marine aquacultural settings and adjacent coastal environments. Bacterial pathogens may also acquire antibiotic resistance via gene mutations and horizontal gene transfers in such environments, making bacterial infectious diseases extremely difficult or even impossible to treat using conventional antibiotic-based therapies. Consequently, phage therapy has received increasing attention in recent years. This study describes the characterization of phage vB_VnaS-L3 from Vibrio natriegens, and explores its potential application as a biocontrol agent to replace antibiotics against pathogenic V. natriegens in juvenile Pacific abalones aquaculture. Our findings showed that phage vB_VnaS-L3 could be a potential alternate biocontrol and prophylactic agent that could effectively inhibit the growth of pathogenic V. natriegens, significantly reduce the mortality of juvenile abalones, and maintain abalone feeding capacity. Phage-based pathogen control (i.e., phage therapy) has received increasing scientific attention to reduce and prevent the emergence, transmission, and detrimental effects of antibiotic resistance. In the current study, multidrug-resistant Vibrio natriegens strain AbY-1805 was isolated and tentatively identified as a pathogen causing the death of juvenile Pacific abalones (Haliotis discus hannai Ino). In order to apply phage therapy, instead of antibiotics, to treat and control V. natriegens infections in marine aquaculture environments, a lytic phage, vB_VnaS-L3, was isolated. It could effectively infect V. natriegens AbY-1805 with a short latent period (40 min) and high burst size (similar to 890 PFU/cell). Treatment with vB_VnaS-L3 significantly reduced the mortality of juvenile abalones and maintained abalone feeding capacity over a 40-day V. natriegens challenge experiment. Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses suggested that vB_VnaS-L3 was a novel marine Siphoviridae-family phage. Furthermore, vB_VnaS-L3 had a narrow host range, possibly specific to the pathogenic V. natriegens strains. It also exhibited viability at a wide range of pH, temperature, and salinity. The short latent period, large burst size, high host specificity, and broad environmental adaptation suggest that phage vB_VnaS-L3 could potentially be developed as an alternative antimicrobial for the control and prevention of marine animal infections caused by pathogenic V. natriegens.",10.3390/biology11111670,,,2079-7737,,NOV,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology11111670,36421384

However, the resistance of marine animals to pathogens while under the influence of noise is a topic that has received little attention. To assess the immune defense response of sea slugs against pathogens when exposed to low frequency noise, we performed 120 h exposure experiments on sea slugs after a Vibrio parahaemolyticus application in low frequency noise at 500 Hz and 1000 Hz. We found that after the infection with V. parahaemolyticus, the survival rate of the sea slugs decreased, the apoptosis rate and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production of hemocytes increased significantly (P < 0.05), the proliferation of hemocytes accelerated, the activities of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), alanine transaminase (ALT) and lysozyme (LZM) in the hepatopancreas increased significantly, and the expression of TNF signaling pathway-related genes (TNF-a, FADD, Caspase 8, Caspase 3) and Hsp70 genes were generally upregulated. In addition, exposure of sea slug after infected with V. parahaemolyticus to low frequency noise resulted in a significant increase in both antioxidant and immune parameters, which were positively correlated with frequency. The results showed that noise frequency and exposure time had an interactive effect on the above indicators.

Hence, this study aimed to understand if there was difference in these peptide levels of fast and slow growing Pacific abalones, Haliotis discus hannai. To this end, four abalone insulin-related peptides (AIPs) are mined from cerebral ganglia transcriptomes of fast-growing and slow-growing abalones: AIP1,-2,-3 and-6. Notably, these AIPs possess 8 cysteine residues in their predicted insulin A and B chains, potentially supporting four disulfide bridges. Further sequence analysis based on the phylogenetic tree and multiple alignment methods indicated that AIPs have sequence features that are conserved among MIPs in many gastropods. The tissue distributions of four AIPs showed ubiquitous and similar expression in the following tissues including the cerebral ganglion, hepatopancreas, gonad, and mantle of both genders. However, there is some difference in other tissue distribution. Since the food consumption is intimately associated with the hemolymph glucose and animal growth, relative AIP1,-2,-3 and -6 expression levels in the cerebral ganglion were measured following seaweed supplementation. The animals fed with brown seaweed showed increased these AIPs by 1.6-4.7 folds from 3 h after feeding, which lasting to 12 h, coinciding with the peak of hemolymph glucose.

Nutritional quality-related traits are a major objective in aquatics as they determine the value of products and consumer preference. Estimating genetic parameters and the potential of genomic selection is significant in designing breeding programs, which has not been performed in abalone. In the study, we developed near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) models for collagen content (CC) and taurine content (TC) in Pacific abalone, estimated the genetic parameters for glycogen content (GLY), total protein content (TPC), CC, and TC, and assessed the prediction ability of GBLUP and three Bayesian methods for the four nutritional traits. The genetic analysis included all 274 individuals and 69,530 high quality SNPs. The prediction correlation of the NIRS models were 0.9702 and 0.9289 for CC and TC, respectively. The heritability of GLY, TPC, CC, and TC was 0.33 +/- 0.13, 0.42 +/- 0.14, 0.02 +/- 0.10 and 0.32 +/- 0.13, respectively, while the heritability of growth traits in our study ranged from 0.34 +/- 0.14 to 0.47 +/- 0.14. Negative correlations were observed between GLY and both TPC (-0.96 +/- 0.03) and TC (-0.90 +/- 0.07), whereas moderate correlations were found between GLY and growth traits. The prediction ability for GLY, TPC, and TC was 0.21 +/- 0.04 to 0.22 +/- 0.03, 0.27 +/- 0.02 to 0.29 +/- 0.03, 0.20 +/- 0.03 to 0.24 +/- 0.02, respectively, using four genomic selection (GS) models (GBLUP, BayesA, BayesB, and BayesCpi).

Prior to closure, harvests of the main species that compose the fishery (the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens Swainson 1822; the green abalone, Haliotis fulgens Philippi 1845; and the pink abalone, Haliotis corrugata Gray 1828) had plummeted to an all-time low of several hundred thousand pounds per year. Overfishing and several diseases identified recently in abalone are creating concern within the industry with respect to the recovery of the fishery. One method being considered to restore the fishery on a limited basis is reseeding. Reseeding success is dependent on many factors. including planting location and techniques of seed placement. Other important factors include the abundance and nutritive quality of macroalgae (kelp) available to the abalone, the seawater temperature requirement of the species being seeded, the size of the seed being planted, and the presence of potential predators within the seed site. In this study, we observed that shell growth and weight gain in juvenile red and green abalone are temperature-dependent. When constant, elevated temperatures are maintained, growth rates improved as compared to growth rates in animals kept at the lower temperatures normally found. More growth in juvenile red abalone was observed at 19 degrees C, with an average daily shell growth of 0.1 mm/day. Previous work suggested that Egregia laevigata, a brown kelp was a superior food source for juvenile abalone; however, the growth rates of I rd abalone fed Egregia increased minimally compared to growth rates of juvenile red abalone fed another brown kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. Maximum sustained shell growth of 0.16 mm/day in juvenile green abalone was observed at a culture temperature of 21 degrees C. Extrapolations of these growth rates for an entire year indicate growth of 36 mm/y for red abalone and 60 mm/y for green abalone, Growth predictions based on laboratory-reared juveniles will vary from those observed in wild populations since seawater temperatures are not static along the coast and may vary as much as 10-12 degrees C during the year. The nutritional value of kelp and other algae may be as important as temperature in the effect on growth observed in the laboratory and in the field. Increased growth rates exhibited by juvenile red abalone during the period from January through April 1977 may be reflective of changing nutrient ratios or levels in kelp that are otherwise limiting during reduced or non-upwelling months. We are presently culturing hatchery-produced red and green abalone seed for eventual planting in the U.S, Department of the Interior's Cabrillo National Monument. The seed are approximately 45 mm in size and are fed a mixed kelp diet. They will be transplanted when they are approximately 75-100 mm in size. Reseeding success assessed by annual dive surveys should help determine if planting larger animals increases survival of brood stock and increases recruitment within the monument area.",,,0730-8000,,,JUN,,

Such decisions are based on appetitive state, which is the integration of sensation, internal state, and memory. Value-based decisions are accessible in neuronal circuitry of simple systems [1]. In one such system, the predatory sea slug Pleurobranchaea, appetite is readily quantified in behavior [2] and related to approach/avoidance decision [3]. Moreover, motor aspects of feeding and turning can be observed as fictive motor output in the isolated central nervous system (CNS) [4, 5]. Here we found that the excitation state of the feeding motor network both manifested appetitive state and controlled expression of orienting versus avoidance. In isolated CNSs, spontaneous feeding network activity varied proportionally to donor feeding thresholds. CNSs from low- and high-feeding-threshold donors expressed fictive orienting or avoidance, respectively, in response to brief stimulation of sensory nerves. Artificially exciting the feeding network converted fictive avoidance to orienting. Thus, the feeding network embodied appetitive state and toggled approach/avoidance decision by configuring response symmetry of the premotor turn network. A resulting model suggests a basic cost/benefit decision module from which to consider evolutionary elaboration of the circuitry to serve more intricate valuation processes in complex animals.",10.1016/j.cub.2011.10.055,,0960-9822,1879-0445,,Jan-24,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2011.10.055,22197246

Postlarvae (3-7 per dish) were allowed to graze for two to three hours and video recordings were taken to estimate postlarval size and grazing rates by digital image analysis. Seawater was changed every other day and postlarvae were measured again after six to eight days to estimate growth. Grazing and growth rates of postlarvae older than 15 days increased linearly with biofilm density, The highest grazing rates for seven and 60 day-old abalone were 79 and 10,999 cells/postlarva/hour, respectively. The most important increase in grazing activity occurred between ages 45 and 60 days when postlarvae reached 1.5-2.0 mm and started the formation of the first respiratory pore.

Abalone were fed five different experimental diets in which FO (control diet) was serially replaced by 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% FlaxO respectively. RESULTS: Muscle, gonad and digestive gland of abalone fed the control diet and the diets containing 25%, 50% and 75% FlaxO showedsignificantlyhigher (P < 0.05) levels of eicosapentaenoicacid (EPA), docosapentaenoicacid (DPA) anddocosahexaenoic acid (DHA) compared to those fed the 100% FlaxO. The results also showed that Delta-6 desaturase and elongase gene expression in muscle was increased in a graded manner by increasing dietary FlaxO. The expression of both genes was higher in abalone fed the FlaxO- substituted diets compared to the abalone fed FO. CONCLUSION: The replacement of FOwith FlaxO in commercial abalone diets at levels of 25- 75% can improve the composition of health- benefiting n- 3 polyunsturated fatty acids in tissues of cultured hybrid abalone, and achieve similar outcomes to FO supplementation.

To counter grazing effects, constitutive and induced anti-herbivory responses evolved in seaweeds. Feeding-assayed induction experiments were conducted in the laboratory to investigate whether 14 d grazing periods by either the periwinkle Littorina brevicula or the abalone Haliotis discus induced anti-herbivory defences in the green alga Ulva pertusa and the brown alga Laminaria japonica. Where appropriate, assays were repeated with artificial food containing lipophilic algal extracts, using dichloromethane (DCM) as a solvent, to test whether or not snails induced chemical defences. While exposure to periwinkles reduced palatability of fresh L. japonica pieces for naive conspecific grazers, no such effect was displayed by abalone-exposed L. japonica pieces. Patterns of grazer specificity in the palatability of fresh algae were not confirmed when using artificial food containing algal DCM extracts. This suggests that L. japonica either induced morphological defences or periwinkle-deterrent substances originated from the non-lipophilic fraction of defensive chemicals. Grazer-specific induced responses were not apparent in U. pertusa assays. This study revealed that the induction of chemical anti-herbivory responses depends not only on the type of grazer but also on the type of alga on which the grazer feeds.",10.3354/meps07255,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps07255,

Federal Endangered Species Act-listed white abalone (Haliotis sorenseni) in California, USA depends on the success of a captive breeding program, which requires collection of wild broodstock to maintain genetic diversity. Foot damage is frequently sustained during collection and handling, and severe injuries can be fatal. This study used the proxy species red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) to investigate the ability of abalone to survive foot injury by administering foot injuries varying in severity and monitoring subsequent health and survival. In a preliminary study, 6/6 farm-origin 55-70 mm animals survived two types of injury while 5/6 survived a third type of injury. We then conducted a definitive study using 24 wild-origin animals (165-207 mm) and three intensified injury treatments. Five of six animals that received a deep tissue incision were dead the following morning, presumably from acute hemolymph loss, and the remaining animal in that treatment group died on day 41 with a systemic bacterial infection. Nine of twelve abalone that received loss of either 8% or 17% of foot sole epithelium survived until experiment termination at day 90, at which time all survivors were regenerating epithelial tissues, as evident by histology. This study suggests that abalone may be more capable of surviving significant superficial foot damage that can occur during collection and handling, at least in a captive rearing environment, than has been previously recognized.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735734,"Loeher, Malina M./0000-0001-9589-5641",0044-8486,1873-5622,,Dec-15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735734,

The Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai, is a nocturnal animal that avoids strong light and prefers darkness. Previous research showed that the abalone mortality rate under short-wavelength blue light was remarkably greater than that under darkness, natural light and orange light. In this study, the temporal variations in the dopamine content of abalone hemolymph under various light condi-tions were compared, and the dopamine content after exposure to blue light for 6 h was remarkably higher than that in any other group. The full-length monoamine oxidase (MAO) gene sequence for the catecholamine metabolism-related MAO enzyme was obtained by cloning. This gene encoded 545 amino acids, in which the predicted sequence contained a domain that was characteristic for monoamino oxidase. The MAO expression levels were highest in the hepatopancreas and in situ hybridization further revealed that MAO was widely localized around the hepatic nerve cord. The in vitro recombinant MAO protein could catalyze the degradation of epinephrine and dopamine. After 3 h exposure to blue light, the expression levels of MAO, Mn-superoxide dis-mutase (Mn-SOD), and catalase (CAT) genes were remarkably greater than those in any other group, but the lysozyme (LYZ) and sigma-glutathione-s-transferase (GSTs) expression levels began to increase at 12 h and 6 h, respectively. After the MAO expression levels were knocked-down by RNAi technology, the dopamine concen-tration significantly increased, but the phagocytic activity, nitric oxide concentration, and the Mn-SOD, CAT, GSTs and LYZ expression levels were remarakbly lower than in the control group and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) group, suggesting that the normal dopamine metabolism process played a vital role in maintaining the immune response. The above results show that monoamine oxidase may act as an immuno-modulator in abalone when responding to adverse light conditions. These results could also be useful when drawing up conservation measures for preserving nearshore benthic biodiversity, such as optimizing urban night lighting schemes.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739726,,0044-8486,1873-5622,,Oct-15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739726,

This showed that benthic community composition remained largely unchanged whether H. midae was present or absent and specifically revealed no evidence that H. midae diminishes algal biomass, probably because in the region where we worked, it feeds mainly by trapping drift kelp rather than grazing on attached algae. The absence of responses to the removal of abalone was additionally evident in comparison with indices of abundance and diversity, functional groups and individual species.

The most dominant genus among the intestinal samples in both size groups was Mycoplasma, followed by Psychrilyobacter, Vibrio, and Algibacter. The microbial genus that were more prevalent in large than small abalone were Mycoplasma (32.3635 ? 4.356%), followed by Psychrilyobacter (17.305 ? 8.179) and unclassified species belonging to Mycoplasmataceae (2.930 ? 0.794%), and Rhodospirillaceae (2.555 ? 0.486%). The microbial genera more prevalent in small abalone were as follows: Algibacter (4.944 ? 0.969%), Shewanella (3.037 ? 0.589%), and Haloferula (2.810 ? 0.445). A higher ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes was observed in large abalone (1.067 ? 0.694) than in small abalone (0.027 ? 0.013). The species richness within each group was assessed based on OTUs (L: 371.38 ? 136.40, S: 837.63 ? 138.99, P < 0.001), the Chao1 index (L: 380.31 ? 141.03, S: 860.18 ? 151.01), and abundance-based coverage estimator values (L: 391.89 ? 147.17, S: 888.19 ? 163.38). Species diversity was compared between groups based on the Shannon index (L: 2.82 ? 0.5, S: 4.41 ? 0.11, P < 0.001). These results indicated that microbial species diversity was higher in small abalone with slower growth rates. Understanding changes in the characteristics of intestinal microbial populations in Pacific abalones, and the relationship thereof with growth rates, will provide a basis for developing a microbiota-based strategy for abalone aquaculture.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.736500,,0044-8486,1873-5622,,May-15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.736500,
"DeSantiago, R; White, WK; Hyde, JR; Swiney, KM; Long, JD",Consumer- and seaweed-specific impacts of invasion-mediated changes to detrital subsidies on rocky shores,2025,ECOSPHERE,16,2,,,e70165,"Detrital subsidies such as leaf litter, animal carcasses, and marine wrack can profoundly shape recipient habitats by influencing resiliency and productivity. Species introductions and climate-driven range shifts alter the quantity and quality of these subsidies in donor habitats, thereby potentially influencing recipient communities. Such impacts might be particularly important when detrital shifts alter detritivore feeding and performance. Attempts to identify a general theory predicting the consequences of invasive species on detritivores have been challenging, in part because most theories have been based on the study of microbes or consumers of living prey. Further, two recent meta-analyses disagree about the impacts of invasive plants on detritivore populations. Here, we examined the potential impact of a human-mediated shift in macroalgal detrital subsidy from native giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) to invasive devilweed (Sargassum horneri) on recipient rocky shores, with an emphasis on exploring species-specific impacts. We assessed consumer performance on single species diets or on a mixture in no-choice assays, and we assessed feeding preference in choice assays. Additionally, we examined the impacts of this shift on grazing of native benthic seaweeds by an intertidal consumer assemblage. Replacing native Macrocystis with invasive Sargassum had consumer-specific impacts on performance-suppressing growth of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) but enhancing growth of black turban snails (Tegula funebralis). The effect of mixed diets on consumer growth also displayed consumer specificity. Also, replacing Macrocystis with invasive Sargassum increased grazing of native benthic seaweeds by a realistic detritivore assemblage, but only on the habitat-forming brown seaweed, Silvetia compressa. Thus, invasion-mediated changes in detrital wrack composition had consumer- and seaweed-specific impacts. Such species specificity could underlie disagreements about the impact of species invasions on detritivore populations and could impede our ability to identify a general theory about how species invasions will impact recipient communities via detrital pathways.",10.1002/ecs2.70165,,2150-8925,,,FEB,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.70165,

Relying on coastal waters, the aquaculture area has suffered ecological and economic losses caused by hypoxia, especially in summer. In this study, to investigate the stress resistance of the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai (DD) and the hybrid H. discus hannai female x H. fulgens male (DF), a combination of physiological, biochemical, and metabolomic methods were used to compare the metabolic responses of these two abalones to acute hypoxia (similar to 0.5mg O-2/L, 12 h) and reoxygenation (similar to 6.6mg O-2/L, 10-20 h). Hemolymph characteristics and aerobic/anaerobic respiratory capacity changed significantly under hypoxia or reoxygenation conditions, and they were regulated in different trends in two abalones. The contents of hepatopancreas glycogen in two abalones reached the trough after 10 h recovery, implying that short-term hypoxia leads to a long-lasting (several hours) imprint on the energy storage of abalone. In response to dissolved oxygen fluctuation, metabolic profiles of two abalones changed in distinct ways both in the hypoxia group or the reoxygenation group. The conversion of carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism indicated that hypoxia prompts abalone to change the way of energy metabolism, which may also reflect the difference in the energy utilization of DD and DF abalones. In addition, 3 metabolites (L-glutamate, 2-hydroxy-butanoic acid, and 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid) as potential biomarkers for hypoxia and reoxygenation response in abalone were determined by operating characteristic analysis (ROC). Overall, this study provides information towards understanding the damage caused by frequent hypoxic events and implies the metabolic shifts that occur under hypoxia and reoxygenation conditions in DD and DF abalones.

Sea urchin mortality was influenced by UIA concentrations and increased with increasing levels of UIA. The mortality in the high-concentration group increased throughout the experimental period, and, ultimately, only 24% of the sea urchins survived. Compared to the control. gonad growth was significantly reduced at UIA concentrations above 0.016 mg 1(-1). Sea urchins from the exposed groups did not display a significant reduction in feed intake compared to the control. which suggests that the gonad growth reduction could not be attributed to a decreased feed intake.

HINT plays an important role in many biological processes especially in cell biology, and it has been found in a wide variety of species. However, the functional attributes of HINT homologues in invertebrates have not yet been reported. Here we identified a HINT homologue in abalone, which we named ab-HINT. The ab-HINT shows significant structural and functional similarities to mammalian HINT. RT-PCR and western blot analysis show that ab-HINT is ubiquitously expressed in abalone tissues and highly expressed in hemocyte and gills. In addition, significant up-regulation of ab-HINT was observed after LPS or Poly I:C challenge. Immunostainings suggest that ab-HINT is expressed predominantly in epithelial cells and mainly localized in the cytoplasmic compartment. Studies of the effect on cell apoptosis indicate that ab-HINT can trigger hemocytes apoptosis and p53 is involved in this process. These results conclude that ab-HINT is involved in the immune response of abalone and may be a potential pro-apoptotic factor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first identification and characterization of a HINT homologue in invertebrates. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This, in turn, affects the stability of ecological systems and the security of the aquaculture industry. In this study, we investigated the effects of different fasting regimens (GY: fasting at 1-day intervals, GL: fasting at 2-day intervals) on the behavioral and physiological adaptability of Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), a marine gastropod, particularly in response to recurrent marine heat waves. Our findings revealed that the survival rates of abalone in both the GY and GL groups were significantly higher than those in the unfasted control group (ZC) (P < 0.05). Furthermore, behavioral assessments revealed that the cumulative distance moved, feeding durations, and the percentage of cumulative feeding time relative to movement time were significantly greater in the GL group compared to both the ZC and GY groups (P < 0.05). Sequencing of the 16S rDNA amplicon revealed that the intestinal microbial community of abalone in the GL group harbored a higher abundance of beneficial bacteria (Arenimonas, Pseudolabrys) compared to the GY and ZC groups. In contrast, the potentially harmful bacterium Tenacibaculum was significantly reduced in the GY group relative to the ZC group (P < 0.05). A non-targeted metabolomics analysis identified amino acids and fatty acids, such as Citrulline, Leu-Pro, and L-Glutamate, as differential metabolic markers. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the 'Biosynthesis of amino acids' pathway was significantly enriched in both the GY and GL groups compared to the ZC group (P < 0.05). Further analysis of 23 amino acids showed that 15 and 20 amino acids, including glycine and serine, were downregulated in the GY and GL groups, respectively, compared to the ZC group. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between the relative abundance of both Arenimonas and Pseudolabrys in the abalone's gut and citrulline content in the GY and GL groups (P < 0.05).

Seven semi-purified diets were formulated with graded levels of guaiacol (0, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 mg kg(-1)). Abalone (initial weight: 0.29 +/- 0.01 g; initial shell length: 8.55 +/- 0.27 mm) were fed with these diets in a re-circulated water system for 152 days. The results showed that the contents of calcite in the shell increased significantly with dietary guaiacol levels, but the aragonite content decreased significantly. Dietary guaiacol significantly decreased the contents of calcium and strontium, but significantly increased the magnesium content in the shell. The effects of dietary guaiacol on the contents of phosphorus and zinc in shell were not significant. It was obvious that the ratio of potential acidic/basic amino acids [(Asx+Glx)/(Lys+Arg+His)] in the shell was elevated by dietary guaiacol. In conclusion, dietary guaiacol has effects on both the mineralogy and the amino acid composition in the shell.

Here, we characterized HIF-1 alpha in Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), an aquaculture-relevant mollusk species, and its transcriptional regulation patterns in response to oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent stimuli were investigated. The molecular cloning and sequence analysis revealed that the abalone HIF-1 alpha shared conversed features in its domain organization such as basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain, Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain, oxygen-dependent degradation domains (ODDDs), and C-terminal transactivation domain (C-TAD) with metazoan orthologs. The abalone HIF-1 alpha was proven to be transcriptionally active in multiple tissues according to dissolved oxygen contents, with the most sensitive responsiveness in the gill. Under non-hypoxic conditions, the tissue-dependent transcriptional regulation patterns of the abalone HIF-1 alpha were closely correlated and intertwined with those of HSP90 and MT in response to thermal challenge and heavy metal exposure, respectively. The abalone HIF-1 alpha expression was significantly modulated under normoxic conditions in response to immune challenges with lipopolysaccharide and Vibrio harveyi with the highest upregulation in the hemocytes. However, the combined treatment of hypoxia and immune stimulation exhibited no synergistic activation for the induction of HIF-1 alpha mRNA. Collectively, dynamic transcriptional regulation of the abalone HIF-1 alpha with the tissue specificity in response to oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent stimulatory challenges suggests that HIF-1 alpha plays crucial roles in interdependent crosstalk between hypoxia, innate immunity, and environmental stresses, which can be a useful basis to investigate cellular and physiological responses of farmed abalones to oxygen depletion and other-related stress factors.",10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.100566,,2352-5134,,,MAR,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.100566,

Urchins were fed microalgae (Achnanthes longipes, Cocconeis sublittoralis or Saccharina longissima gametophyte), macroalgae (S. longissima sporophyte or Ulva pertusa), or starved, and their growth rate (GR) was examined to identify the size at which sea urchins' diet shifts from microalgae to macroalgae. Changes in specific activity of seven enzymes (amylase, glycogen hydrolase, carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase), laminarinase, alginate lyase, protease and lipase) were investigated in urchins of test diameters (TDs) 1.0-3.5, 3.0-4.5 and 6.0-9.2 mm to elucidate ontogenetic and diet-responsive changes. GRs were generally higher in urchins of < 6 mm TD fed microalgae than in those fed macroalgae. However, GRs of urchins fed macroalgae increased linearly for a TD of a parts per thousand 3 mm to a TD of a parts per thousand 6 mm. Activity for every enzyme was low in urchins < 3 mm in TD. Development of enzyme production capacity and increased ability to regulate enzyme activity in response to ingested diets were observed for urchins > 3 mm in TD. Our results suggest that the primary nutrient source of S. intermedius shifts from microalgae to macroalgae at a parts per thousand 6 mm TD, and that macroalgae digestion efficiency in urchins a parts per thousand yen3 mm TD gradually improves because of activation of the enzymes. Highly activated enzymes enable sea urchins to efficiently digest nutrients stored in the bodies of macroalgae, allowing the primary nutrient source of S. intermedius to shift from microalgae to macroalgae.",10.1007/s00227-015-2630-z,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,APR,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-015-2630-z,

Since the ratio between the two forms of glutathione (GSH/GSSG) is important for the optimal function of GSH to act as an antioxidant against H2O2, the contribution of GSR as an enzymatic regulatory agent to maintain the proper ratio is essential. Abalones are marine mollusks that frequently encounter environmental factors that can trigger the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2. Therefore, we conducted the current study to reveal the molecular and functional properties of a GSR homolog in the disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus. The identified cDNA sequence (2325 bp) has a 1356 bp long open reading frame (ORF), coding for a 909 bp long amino acid sequence, which harbors a pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase domain (171-246 aa), a pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase dimerization domain, and a NAD(P)(+)-binding Rossmann fold superfamily signature domain. Four functional residues: the FAD binding site, glutathione binding site, NADPH binding motif, and assembly domain were identified to be conserved among the other species. The recombinant abalone GSR (rAbGSR) exhibited detectable activity in a standard glutathione reductase activity assay. The optimum pH and optimal temperature for the reaction were found to be 7.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively, while the ionic strength of the medium had no effect. The enzymatic reaction was vastly inhibited by Cu+2 and Cd+2 ions. A considerable effect of cellular protection was detected with a disk diffusion assay conducted with rAbGSR. Moreover, an MIT assay and flow cytometry confirmed the significance of the protective role of rAbGSR in cell function. Furthermore, AbGSR was found to be ubiquitously distributed in different types of abalone tissues. AbGSR mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in response to three immune challenges: Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), thus indicating its possible involvement in host defense mechanisms during pathogenic infections. Taken together, the results of the current study suggest that AbGSR plays an important role in antioxidant-mediated host defense mechanisms and also provide insights into the immunological contribution of AbGSR.

Larvae and early juveniles were fed daily with diatoms, whereas late juveniles and adults were fed with artificial food and the green algae Ulva fasciata. Shell length and total wet weight from 40-80 randomly selected specimens in various experiments were measured monthly, and sex and gonad maturity stage were defined visually. The water parameters in tanks reflected the ambient condition of the Arabian Sea. The growth pattern of the abalone was very similar in the 3 experimental trials. Larvae and early juveniles have very fast growth rates, reaching an average 53-56 mm and 19-25 g after 1 y. Better results were obtained in the second and third experiments, when at the end of 2 y of rearing, abalone mean length was 67-72 mm and the weight was 46-54 g. At the age 3 y, abalone attained a mean length of 83-85 mm and a weight of 89-93 g. After 6 y, the abalone from the first experiment (2001 to 2005) showed, on average, 88.5 mm and 110.9 g. The length increments were the highest during the first year of the culture, whereas weight increments reached maximum values during the third (second and third trials) and fourth year (first trial) of rearing. After 4 y, abalone growth increments in weight decreased significantly. Males generally but not always have larger increments in length and weight when compared with females. During cultivation, a decrease in abalone weight was sometimes observed that, in most cases, coincided with decrease in water temperature during the southwest monsoon period (June to September). Some abalone sexually matured in tanks after 1 y, and mature males and females occurred almost year-round, with peaks in April to May and November to December. The length at first maturity was found to be 65.2 mm for males and 67.1 mm for females. Growth parameters for a von Bertalanffy function were calculated using data from different experiments. The growth rate coefficient in the first experiment was lower (K = 0.65), but in third experiment it appeared higher (K = 0.80) than in natural conditions from data other authors calculated based on length frequency distribution analysis, which indicates faster growth rates of abalone in tanks when compared with those in the wild.

During the first experiment, we removed small predators from brick-filled habitat cages that excluded large predators. The survival rates of juvenile abalone (mean shell length (SL), 22 mm) were greater in cages from which sea stars and other predators were removed periodically than in control cages. During the second experiment, we constructed 30 fenced 1-m(2) outplanting plots and assigned 10 randomly to be controls and 20 to be filled with 1 of 4 complex substrates (0.3-m layer of cobbles, 0.3-m layer of boulders, 0.9-m layer of cobbles, and 0.9-m layer of boulders). We then released 30 large juvenile abalone (mean SL, 51.5 mm) into each plot. The number of live outplanted abalone remaining in the complex substrate plots was significantly greater than in the control plots during the first 6 days. Surveys of a 4-m radius around each plot showed that emigration was lower from complex substrate plots than from control plots, and fewer shell fragments were found. The addition of complex substrate to plots provided crypsis from large predators but also resulted in significantly higher densities of small predators.

To investigate the development of gut microflora in the small abalone Haliotis diversicolor and the effect of various diets on the bacterial communities, we analyzed the composition of gut microbial flora and the bacterial digestive enzymes in connection with four important development stages, i.e., larva, early-juvenile, late-juvenile and grow-out. Among these cultivated bacteria, the Firmicutes group was isolated from both the larval and early-juvenile stages; the CFB (Cytophaga/Flexibacteria/Bacterioides) group was detected in early juveniles, late juveniles and grow-out; the gamma-proteobacteria existed throughout the four development stages. The isolated Bacillus sp. and Pseudoalteromonas sp. dominated in the larvae and were rarely detected in other stages. Subsequently, the genus Vibrio predominated in the latter three phases after the first feeding. Cluster analysis of the DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis) patterns was basically congruent with the result of culture-dependent method in which the gut bacterial community indicated the successional change in the development stages. And the artificial diets contribute to the change of gut bacterial composition to some extent. The enzyme assay showed that the gut bacteria isolated from the early juveniles produced the greatest diverse digestive enzymes compared with those isolated from other development stages. most cultivated bacteria in each development stage showed protease, lipase or alginate-degrading activities which could help the farmed abalone H. diversicolor to digest diets.

There are three isozymes of AIF that have been identified to date, designated as AIF1, AIF2, and AIF3; the human AlF3 is also known as an ALF-like protein (AIFL). This study aimed to identify and characterize a homologue of AlF3 from disk abalone (AbAIF3) that belongs to the phylum Mollusca. The open reading frame (ORF) of AbAIF3 is 1749 base pairs (bp) in length and encodes a protein of 583 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 63.14 kDa. Based on our in-silico analysis, the AbAIF3 protein harbored the typical domain architecture as that of the known AIF family proteins, consisting of N-terminal Rieske and pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase domain. Comparative protein sequence analysis confirmed that AbAIF3 is a homolog of AlF3. Moreover, our phylogenetic analysis revealed that AbAIF3 had a close evolutionary relationship with the molluscan counterparts. Interestingly, AbAIF3 was shown to induce apoptosis in HEK293T cells using transfection assays followed by flow cytometric analysis. In addition, we found that AbAIF3 mRNA expression was ubiquitous in physiologically important tissues, and significantly modulated upon experimental immune stimulations in hemocytes. Collectively, our study illustrates the indispensable role of AbAlF3 in inducing apoptosis in disk abalones, which in turn might be involved in hosts' immune defense mechanisms against microbial infections.

For successful recovery, supplementation may be necessary. To determine appropriate culture methods, juveniles were reared in habitat-enriched tanks (supplemented with rocks, macroalgae and sea urchins) or conventional aquaculture tanks and assessed for growth and survivorship in the laboratory over 15 months. No differences in survivorship or growth were observed. Subsequent experiments examined whether abalone behaviour (habitat selection and movement patterns) differed between rearing treatments. Abalone were exposed to one of three predator treatments (sea star arm, small crab, or no predator (control)) and filmed for 8 h. Abalone from habitat-enriched tanks changed habitats significantly more often than abalone from conventional tanks regardless of predator treatment. Significant differences in the percentage of time that abalone occupied the various habitats were also observed. Abalone in the sea star and control treatments primarily occupied the rocks, whereas abalone in the crab treatment behaved differently depending on the rearing method; conventionally reared abalone spent more time in corners, whereas abalone from habitat-enriched tanks spent more time exposed.

Over 6,000 t per annum of kelp Ecklonia maxima are now harvested for this purpose, and some kelp beds are reaching maximum sustainable limits. Research into seaweed aquaculture as feed (Ulva and some Gracilaria) for abalone started in the late 1990s on the southeast coast (where there are no kelp beds) using abalone waste water. A growing body of evidence suggests that a mixed diet of kelp plus other seaweeds can give growth rates at least as good as compound feed, and can improve abalone quality and reduce parasite loads. A pilot scale Ulva lactuca and abalone integrated recirculation unit using 25% recirculation was designed and built on the south west coast of South Africa using one 12,000-L abalone tank containing 13,200 15 +/- 2.5 g abalone, connected to two 3,000-L seaweed tanks containing an initial starting biomass of 10 kg of seaweed, replicated 3 times. In an 18-month period, there were no significant differences in abalone health or growth rates, sediment build up and composition, mobile macro fauna densities and species between the recirculation or the flow-through units. Transfer of oxygen generated by the seaweeds to the abalone tanks was poor, resulting in the recirculated abalone tanks having lower (33%) dissolved oxygen concentrations than a comparable flow-through abalone unit. Seaweed nutrient content and specific growth rates in the units were comparable to seaweeds cultivated in fertilized effluent (SGR = 3.2 +/- 3.4%.day(-1); Yield = 0.2 +/- 0.19 kg.m(2).day(-1)).

UB56 strain showed the highest percentage of internalization (3.65%) and presented a moderate level of adhesion (4.6 x 10(6)). In contrast, UB152, the most adherent strain (8.7 x 10(6)) showed a low capacity to internalize (0.65%).

We addressed all these topics by exploring interactions between the urchin Parechinus angulosus and both recruits and juveniles of the abalone Haliotis midae, in the light of the fact that juvenile abalone shelter beneath the urchins. In field experiments at six sites. urchins were eliminated from removal plots to determine the degree to which juvenile abalone (individuals 3-35 mm in length) depend upon urchins. Comparisons were made with undisturbed and disturbance-control plots. We hypothesized that after removal of urchins: (1) there would be an immediate decline of juvenile abalone, since they are intimately associated with the urchins; (2) abalone recruits (recent settlers <3 mm in length) would be unlikely to suffer immediately or directly because, unlike juveniles, they are only weakly associated with the urchins; (3) foliar algae would proliferate due to decreased grazing by urchins; (4) there would be a consequent reduction in crustose coralline algae due to overgrowth by foliar algae; and (5) the decline of crustose corallines would reduce recruitment of abalone due to a loss of settlement and nursery habitat. In urchin-removal plots, juvenile abalone declined dramatically, becoming virtually extinct locally. Their disappearance was slowest in crevices compared with exposed habitats, but even there they failed to survive longer than five months. Contrary to expectations, abalone recruits also disappeared from urchin-removal plots, possibly because the cover of sediment almost doubled there. Also contrary to our hypotheses, neither foliar macroalgae nor encrusting corallines responded to urchin removal. The explanation of these results is that P. angulosus was able to gather drift kelp when this food source was available, rather than acting as an active grazer. This feeding pattern has profound consequences and explains why urchins failed to influence algal community composition. By sheltering beneath urchins, juvenile abalone gain protection from predators and may also benefit from an enhanced food supply. Bottom-up subsidization of urchins by drift kelp is thus responsible for the feeding behavior of the urchins, and indirectly facilitates their role in harboring juvenile abalone. This role is of immense importance for the lucrative abalone fishery, and depletion of urchins could lead to a collapse of abalone populations. Human exploitation of top predators that consume urchins, such as rock lobsters and some fishes, has conceivably exaggerated the role of urchins in sustaining juvenile abalone.",10.1890/0012-9615(2002)072[0133:EOSUPA]2.0.CO;2,,0012-9615,1557-7015,,FEB,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9615(2002)072[0133:EOSUPA]2.0.CO;2,

In the present study, red abalone, Haliotis rufescens Swainson 1822, with single sabellid infestations were isolated in containers at 18degreesC (single host and sabellid per container). This first, parental generation (P), was held in isolation until individuals produced F, larvae. The F, larvae were subsequently isolated until individuals produced a second, F-2, generation. In a separate study, uninfested red abalone were exposed to sabellid infested abalone at 11.2degreesC, 15.6degreesC, and 20.9degreesC, temperatures typically encountered in California. The larvae were subsequently observed as they developed to specific life stages: the initiation of feeding, the development of all 11 setigers (which closely relates to sexual maturation) and the completion of their life cycle as recognized by the production of motile, infesting, larvae, Approximately 50% of the sabellids examined at 11.2degreesC, 15.6degreesC, and 20.9degreesC had developed the ability to feed by day 6, 5 and 4 (P < 0.001), had developed all 11 setigers by day 83, 68 and 48 (P < 0,001) and had produced larvae by day 298, 165 and 111 (P < 0.001), respectively.

We fit 7 growth functions to annual growth increment data to estimate age at maturity, time to reach the minimum legal size (MLS) in the historic fishery, and the number of reproductive years before reaching the MLS. We used demographic data to construct a growth transition probability matrix based on the best-fit (Richards) model. We estimated that pink abalone grow slowly (k = 0.07 yr(-1)), reaching a maximum length of 200 mm, and have high adult survivorship (0.77 yr(-1)). We used non-lethal methods to estimate size at maturity, which was 99 mm for males and 103 mm for females (8.2 to 8.7 yr), with 19 yr to reach fishery size. Survival rates in this population did not differ between years or genders, but severe cuts to the foot during handling did decrease survivorship. Despite low population densities, we show evidence of some juvenile recruitment to the region. The slow growth rates suggest that the populations within the southern California abalone fishery closure area could take 30 yr to recover, provided there is successful reproduction and the high survival of adults continues without illegal fishing.

Although the nutritional importance of abalone has been reported through in vitro and in vivo studies, there is little evidence about the potential anti-tumor effects of abalone visceral extract.

Methods: In the present study, we used breast cancer model using BALB/c mouse-derived 4T1 mammary carcinoma and investigated the effect of abalone visceral extract on tumor development. Inhibitory effect against tumor metastasis was assessed by histopathology of lungs. Cox-2 productions by primary and secondary tumor were measured by real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting (IB). Proliferation assay based on [H-3]-thymidine incorporation and measurement of cytokines and effector molecules by RT-PCR were used to confirm tumor suppression efficacy of abalone visceral extract by modulating cytolytic CD8+ T cells. The cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cell was compared by JAM test. Results: Oral administration of abalone visceral extract reduced tumor growth (tumor volume and weight) and showed reduced metastasis as confirmed by decreased level of splenomegaly (spleen size and weight) and histological analysis of the lung metastasis (gross analysis and histological staining). Reduced expression of Cox-2 (mRNA and protein) from primary tumor and metastasized lung was also detected. In addition, treatment of abalone visceral extract increased anti-tumor activities of CD8+ T cells by increasing the proliferation capacity and their cytolytic activity.

There are mechanisms to explain this phenomenon, but they are relatively few. In addition, dose-dependent primary infection is also associated with increased immunity. In the present study, the initial infection dose and mortality of abalone Haliotis diversicolor after reinfection with Vibrio harveyi were recorded, and the mechanism of immune enhancement was investigated by the transcriptomic response of abalone after two successive stimuli with V. harveyi. Priming with different concentrations of pathogen can enhance immunity; however, higher concentration is not always better. Compared with the first exposure, more genes were up-regulated after the second exposure. Among the commonly expressed genes, the immune related genes were significantly or persistently highly expressed after two infections and included pattern recognition receptors as well as immune effectors, such as toll-like receptors, perlucin 4, scavenger receptor class B-like protein, cytochrome P450 1B1-like, glutathione S-transferase 6, lysozyme and so on; in addition, these immune-related genes were mainly distributed in the pathways related to phagocytosis and calcium signaling. Among the specifically expressed genes, compared with the first infection, more genes were involved in the immune, metabolic and digestive pathways after the second infection, which would be more conducive to preventing the invasion of pathogens.

Following the starvation period, wet weight loss was 13.4%. Crude protein and NFE accounted for 69.9% and 31.5%, respectively, of the total net loss in dry weight that was calculated to be a total loss of 3.57 kcal/organism. Lipid content of the tissue increased by 1.0% (dry weight) while protein content remained unchanged. Plasma levels of free amino acid, soluble protein and glucose were determined on days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 27. The level of plasma glucose significantly decreased after the first 7 days, 34 to 10 mu m/ml, and then leveled at 15 mu m/mL. Soluble protein in the plasma decreased from 3.33 to 2.6 mg per ml during the starvation period. Taurine was the principal free amino acid among the plasma amino acids, comprising approximately 50-65% and showing a net decrease of almost 75% at 27 days. For the essential amino acids, gross levels of histidine and arginine decreased significantly and correspondingly produced substantially higher net decreases. For the non-essential amino acids, plasma levels of alanine, proline, tyrosine, glutamic acid, and serine decreased significantly by day 27 or earlier, but proportional composition remained similar. After starvation, changes in the gross amounts (mu g/mg total dry weight) of some essential and non-essential amino acids in the muscle and visceral tissue occurred, but their relative proportions remained essentially unchanged. The ratio of the concentration of non-essential to essential amino acids in both the muscle and viscera (similar to 1.9) did not change after starvation. The mean net change of non-essential amino acid content per abalone (within muscle tissue) was higher (-41.8) than that of the essential amino acids -8.9). In contrast to all other amino acids, little or no loss of arginine, histidine and threonine occurred. Plasma levels of carbohydrates and protein in starved abalone dramatically decrease within the first two days and then decrease very slowly. Muscle protein is the principal source of energy, and non-essential amino acids are preferentially used. Retention of arginine in the muscle tissue may reflect its need in arginophosphate for muscle contraction. By converting the decrease in weight to energy loss, the amount of energy used for basal metabolism during starvation was estimated to be 2.99 cal g org(-1) day(-1). (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed that the weight gain rate of abalones in the groups with 0.53% and 1.24% of dietary Hyp were significantly higher than that in the group with 0.05% dietary Hyp. The 0.53% and 1.24% of dietary Hyp significantly increased lysyl hydroxylase and prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity and pyridinium crosslink content, and up-regulated collagen biosynthesis-related gene expression in abalone muscle. Meanwhile, dietary Hyp supplementation significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of mmp-1 and significantly up-regulated the mRNA expression of timp. During the same storage time, the springiness, hardness and water-holding capacity of muscle in the dietary Hyp supplementation treatments were significantly higher. The muscle hardness in the dietary Hyp supplementation groups on day 6 was higher than that in the control group on day 3.

It is a semi-continuous breeder and despite producing small numbers of large eggs, infestation by this animal has reached epidemic proportions on local abalone farms. The present study compared the morphometrics and reproductive characteristics of worms from farmed and wild abalone, in the Walker Bay area of the south Western Cape Province of South Africa, to gain insights into why this animal has become so successful under aquaculture conditions. The farms designated farm A and farm B each had one on-farm site, and two wild sites, while farm C had two on-farm sites and two wild sites. The wild sites were natural abalone habitats located within 2.5 km of the farms. Our results conclusively showed that environmental conditions prevalent on the farms enhanced the reproductive success of these worms relative to that observed in its natural environment. At farms B and C, worms occurred in significantly higher densities at the on-farm sites than in the corresponding wild samples, but at farm A, density was equally low at the three sites. At all three farms, a greater proportion of the population was reproductively active in the on-farm samples than in the wild samples. Worms on farmed abalone had a higher instantaneous fecundity, brooded more clutches simultaneously and were larger than their conspecifics from the wild. There was a positive correlation between adult size and brood size and the number of clutches brooded simultaneously. Within the three on-farm sites there was a negative correlation between egg volume and brood size, indicating a trade-off between these traits. However, such a trade-off was not apparent between sites, with brood size being higher at the on-farm sites than at the wild sites, irrespective of egg size. This suggests that the stable nutrient-enriched environment on the farm led to an increase in fecundity without compromising the size (and implicitly the quality) of the eggs. Worm density did not have a significant effect on body size or any other reproductive traits at most sites, and the density of T. heterouncinata was unaffected by the density of other shell-infesting polychaetes. The results suggest that the farm environment has selected for larger, more fecund worms that breed rapidly with high recruitment success as a consequence of abundant nutrients, high host density, habitat stability and a possible lack of predation and interspecific competition.",10.1007/s00227-005-1552-6,"Simon, Carol/0000-0001-9613-5222; Britz, Peter/0000-0002-4436-0425",0025-3162,,,MAY,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-005-1552-6,

In this study, the seasonal variation in the nutritional components and texture properties of Haliotis discus hannai (DD) and Haliotis discus hannai 9 x H. fulgens delta (DF) was determined. The moisture content of both abalone varieties (DD and DF) was found to be significantly lower in winter than in other seasons, while the opposite was true for the lipid content. In summer, DF had lower levels of protein, lipid, and taurine than DD. The levels of glycine (Gly), alanine (Ala), glutamic (Glu), and arginine (Arg) in abalone were higher in winter and spring than in summer and autumn. In terms of fatty acid levels, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the total amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were the highest in winter compared to other seasons.

This question is becoming more pressing as trophic interactions shift with rapid climate change. Sea urchins and abalone are key invertebrates in the habitats where they reside. Sea urchins are critical members of exemplar trophic cascades in kelp forests due to their impact on kelp establishment and maintenance; yet their populations are controlled by predators, such as sea otters and sunflower sea stars. Abalone compete with urchins for macroalgal food resources and therefore can help regulate urchin populations in kelp forests. Given that both urchin tests and abalone shells used for predator defense are comprised of calcium carbonate, much research has been conducted on the impacts of ocean acidification (OA) on these calcified structures. A growing body of literature has shown that urchin tests are less calcified and break with less force under OA conditions. Less is known about abalone, but their shells also appear to respond negatively to OA. Using kelp forest communities as exemplar ecosystems, we discuss the morphological, biomechanical, and physiological responses to OA in urchins and abalone and consider how these individual level responses scale to trophic interactions and ultimately whole ecosystem processes. Although the impacts of OA on the calcified structures used for defense have been well studied, calcified mechanisms for food consumption, such as the Aristotle's lantern of urchins, are much less understood. Thus, examining both the feeding and defense sides of trophic interactions would greatly improve our understanding of OA responses across individual to ecosystem scales. More generally, measurements of morphological, biomechanical, and physiological responses to OA can be made in individuals to help predict higher level ecological responses, which would greatly contribute to broader predictions of whole ecosystem responses to OA.",10.1093/icb/icae096,,1540-7063,1557-7023,,Aug-02,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/icae096,38986515

Amino acid alignment revealed that HdhNFT shared high similarity with other known ferritins. The HdhNFT contained a highly conserved motif for the ferroxidase center, which consists of seven residues of a typical vertebrate heavy-chain ferritin with a typical stem-loop structure. HdhNFT mRNA contains a 27 bp iron-responsive element (IRE) in the 5'-untranslated region. This IRE exhibited 82.14% similarity with abalone H. discus discus and 78.57% similarity with Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas IREs. By real-time PCR assays, the mRNA transcripts of HdhNFT were found to be higher expressed in kidney, hepatopancreas, gill, mantle and muscle than in haemocytes and gonad. Moreover, mRNA expression levels of HdhNFT in the hepatopancreas and haemocytes were measured by real-time PCR in abalone fed with graded levels of dietary iron (29.2, 65.7, 1267.2 and 6264.7 mg/kg). Results showed that the expression of the HdhNFT mRNA increased with dietary iron contents. Furthermore, the maximum value of the HdhNFT mRNA was found in the treatment with 6264.7 mg/kg of dietary iron.

Reducing the adverse effects of high stocking density while maintaining high biomass is essential to address these problems. Here, we conducted a laboratory experiment to simulate the multi-layer culture for sea urchins at ambient high temperatures (from 22.2 to 24.5 degrees C) in summer for similar to 7 weeks. Survival, body size, lantern growth, gut weight, food consumption, Aristotle's lantern reflex, 5-hydroxytryptamine concentration, pepsin activity and gut morphology were subsequently evaluated. The present study found that multi-layer culture led to significantly larger body size than those without multi-layer culture (the control group). This was probably because of the greater feeding capacity (indicated by lantern growth and Aristotle's lantern reflex) and food digestion (indicated by morphology and pepsin activity of gut) in the multi-layer cultured sea urchins.

However, observed differences in species susceptibility to the disease are not well understood. Here, we examined the susceptibility of three temperate abalone species, the cool water (4-14 degrees C) pinto or northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana), the intermediate water (8-18 degrees C) red abalone (H. rufescens), and the warm water (12-23 degrees C) pink abalone (H. corrugata), to experimental WS infection at temperatures facilitating disease proliferation. Mortality data paired with histological and molecular detection of the WS pathogen confirmed that these abalone species exhibit different levels of susceptibility to infection and resistance to WS development ranging from high susceptibility and low resistance in pinto abalone to moderate/low susceptibility and resistance in red and pink abalones. The temperature associated with WS induced mortalities also varied among species: pinto abalone died at the lowest experimental temperature (17.32 +/- 0.09 degrees C), while red abalone died at an intermediate temperature (17.96 +/- 0.16 degrees C), and pink abalone required the highest temperature (18.84 +/- 0.16 degrees C). When data from the current and previous studies were examined, susceptibility to WS was inversely related to phylogenetic distance from white abalone (H. sorenseni), which had the highest susceptibility and lowest resistance of all abalone species tested prior to the current study. These results provide further evidence that an abalone's thermal optima and phylogenetic relationship can determine its susceptibility to WS; species with cool water evolutionary histories are most susceptible to WS and the most susceptible species appear to be closely related.

Eight SL records were obtained from 3147 individuals in 192 full-sib families at 6, 7, 9, 13, 18, 24, 28, and 32 months after hatching. To estimate the additive genetic and environmental variance components, longitudinal genetic analysis of repeated SL measurements was conducted using multivariate, auto-regressive, antedependence and random regression models with restricted maximum likelihood method. The results showed that the multivariate model with common full-sib family variance and residual heterogeneity of variance was the best model for the given dataset. Heritability estimates showed a decreasing trend with age, which is similar to the results obtained from the quadratic polynomial random regression model, and ranged from 0.629 at 9 months to 0.259 at 32 months. The separate rearing and tagging of single abalone at 6 months may have led to significant common environment family bias and overestimation of heritability.

However, oxidative stress can be inhibited by enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense mechanisms. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are well-known scavengers of superoxide radicals, and they protect cells by detoxifying hazardous reactive oxygen species. Here, we have identified and characterized two different SODs, CuZnSOD and MnSOD, from black rockfish (RfCuZnSOD and RfMnSOD, respectively). In silica analysis revealed the well conserved molecular structures comprising all essential properties of CuZnSOD and MnSOD. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that both RfCuZnSOD and RfMnSOD cladded with their fish counterparts. The recombinant RfSOD proteins demonstrated their potential superoxide scavenging abilities through a xanthine oxidase assay. The optimum temperature and pH conditions for both rRfSODs were 25 degrees C and pH 8, respectively. Moreover, the potential peroxidation function of rRfCuZnSOD was observed in the presence of HCO3-. The highest peroxidation activity was observed at 100 mu g/mL of rRfCuZnSOD using the MTT cell viability assay and flow cytometry. The analogous tissue-specific expression profile indicated ubiquitous expression of both RfCuZnSOD and RfMnSOD in selected tissues of healthy juvenile rockfish. An immune challenge experiment illustrated the altered expression profiles of both RfCuZnSOD and RfMnSOD against lipopolysaccharide, Streptococcus iniae, and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C).

This was accomplished through the close examination of laboratory-grown flat pearl samples and cross-sectional slices of the nacreous shell. Further understanding of the sequenced assembly has been obtained. It has been confirmed that the growth of the aragonite component of the composite occurs by the successive nucleation of aragonite crystals and their arrest by means of a protein-mediated mechanism; it takes place in the Christmas-tree pattern [Nature 49 (1994) 371]. It is shown that the protein layer is virtually absent where plates on a same plane abut (along lateral surfaces of tiles). This suggests a mechanism of c-axis aragonite growth arrest by the deposition of a protein layer of approximately 20-30 m that is periodically activated and determines the thickness of the aragonite platelets, which are remarkably constant (0.5 mum). This platelet size was measured for animals with shell diameters of 10, 50, and 200 mm and was found to be constant. The overall growth process is expressed in terms of parameters incorporating the anisotropy of growth velocity in aragonite (V-c, the velocity along c axis, and V-ab, the velocity in basal plane). Comparison of laboratory-raised and naturally-grown abalone indicates growth regulated by the level of proteinaceous saturation. Naturally-grown abalone exhibits mesolayers (growth bands) similar to0.3 mm apart; it is proposed that they result from seasonal interruptions in feeding patterns, creating thicker (similar to10-20 mum) layers of protein. These mesolayers play a critical role in the mechanical properties, and are powerful crack deflectors. The viscoplastic deformation of the organic inter-tile layers is responsible for the significant improvement of tensile strength over the tensile strength of monolithic aragonite.

Abhisin shows the characteristic features of AMPS including net positive charge (+13), higher hydrophobic residues (27%) and 2.82 kcal/mol protein binding potential. Abhisin shares 80% amino acid identity with the buforin 1 peptide that is derived from Asian toad histone H2A. We synthesized the synthetic peptide of abhisin, and characterized its antimicrobial activities. Our results showed the growth inhibition of Gram positive (G+) Listeria monocytogenes, Gram negative (G-) Vibrio ichthyoenteri bacteria, and fungi (yeast) Pityrosporum ovale by abhisin treatment at 250 mu g/mL However, stronger activity was displayed against the G+ than G- bacteria. Additionally, scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation results confirmed that P. ovale cells were damaged by abhisin treatment. Interestingly, abhisin treatment (50 mu g/mL) decreased the viability of THP-1 leukemia cancer cells approximately by 25% but there was no effect on the normal veto cells, suggesting that abhisin has cytotoxicity against cancer cells but not normal cells. Quantitative real time RT-PCR results revealed that histone H2A transcription was significantly induced at 3 h post-infection with bacteria in abalone gills and digestive tract These results suggest that abhisin is a potential antimicrobial agent, and its precursor histone H2A may be involved in the innate immune defense system in abalone.

This study evaluated the in vitro effects of our previous synthesized SeNPs, coated with abalone visceral polysaccharide-protein complexes (PSP-SeNPs), on the proliferation of probiotics and common aquatic pathogens, and the in vivo effects on the gut microbiome and metabolome of tilapia. PSP-SeNPs selectively promoted the growth of probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactococcus lactis, while inhibiting the growth of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Aeromonas hydrophila. In the fish breeding experiment, 360 healthy juvenile tilapias (initial weight 1.5 +/- 0.5 g/fish) were divided into four groups (3 replicates/group, 30 fish/replicate): group C was fed with basal diet, groups Y, M and H, were fed with the basal diet supplemented with 0.3 mg/kg of Na2SeO3, 0.3 mg/kg of PSP-SeNPs, and 4.5 mg/ kg of PSP-SeNPs, respectively. All fish were tested after 7 weeks of breeding in a recirculating aquaculture system. Results showed that group M significantly increased intestinal microbial diversity and potential probiotics (e.g., Cetobacterium, Fimbriiglobus, and Gemmata), while significantly decreased potential pathogens (Plesiomonas, Citrobacter freundii, and Aeromonas hydrophila). Groups H and Y significantly reduced Citrobacter freundii, but both groups decreased gut microbial diversity to varying degrees. Additionally, the pathogenic bacterial genus Plesiomonas significantly increased in group Y. In group M, the growth-promoting intestinal metabolite alpha-tocotrienol was significantly upregulated, whereas some essential amino acids were significantly downregulated in groups Y and H. In summary, 0.3 mg/kg SeNPs supplementation can regulate the intestinal microbiota, while 4.5 mg/kg SeNPs and 0.3 mg/kg Na2SeO3 can cause amino acid metabolism disorders.

Feeding efficiency was examined using different concentrations of LWMs. The sabellid worm was an efficient feeder. At low particle densities (2.6 x 10(4) particles/mL), 66.7% of the worms had eaten modest levels of LWMs. An asymptote in particle density in relation to feeding occurred at 2.6 x 10(5) particles/mL, with 83% of the worms feeding on large numbers of particles. In separate observations, LWMs composed of tripalmitin and fish oil were observed in various stages of digestion in the stomach, rectum, and fecal pellets of the worms.

The system is designed to allow artificial micro-particulate food to be sprayed (continuously until abalone are capable of feeding on seaweed) onto bard corrugate plastic plates, using agar as a fixative. Two trials were conducted to test substances that could be utilized to improve the settlement and metamorphosis rate of larval Haliotis discus discus when using the above experimental system. In trial 1, plates were sprayed with a mixture containing 1% agar and one of the following: natural diatom powder, Spirulina powder, Chlorella powder and two different concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), each with and without antibiotics. The negative control was a clean plastic plate without any additives and the positive control was plastic plates covered with a living natural diatom biofilm. There was no significant difference in the final metamorphosis rate of larvae induced to settle on the three microalgal powders and the positive control (25.8-35.8%). However, these treatments had a significantly higher larval metamorphosis rate when compared to the negative control and the GABA treatments (1.7-7.5%). GABA did not induce metamorphosis of larvae at a significantly higher rate than the negative control, regardless of whether antibiotics were used or not. In trial 2, the effect of using both algal powders and mucus was tested to determine settlement and metamorphosis rates of larval abalone. Combining the effects of mucus and micro-algal powders or the positive control and mucus resulted in a final larval settlement rate of 80.8-89.2% and metamorphosis rate of 73.3-87.5%. This was significantly higher than the treatments that only incorporated micro-algal powder or the positive control, having an attachment rate of 20.8-41.7% and a total metamorphosis rate of only 3.3-28.3%. There is potential to use micro-algal powder as a substitute to living diatoms, to act as a settlement cue for larval H. discus discus. Abalone mucus should also be used in addition to microalgal powders to increase the settlement rate of larvae and also ensure a high rate of metamorphosis. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we describe a novel transcription factor activator protein-1 (Ap-1) gene from disk abalone Haliotis discus discus (AbAp-1) for the first time in mollusk. It was identified by homology screening of an abalone normalized cDNA library. The cloned AbAp-1 consists of 945 bp coding region that encodes a putative protein containing 315 amino acids. The AbAp-1 gene is composed of a characteristic Jun transcription factor domain and a highly conserved basic leucine zipper (bZIP) signature similar to known Ap-1 genes. The AbAp-1 shares 46, 43 and, 40% amino acid identities with fish (Takifugu rubripes), human and insect (Ixodes scapularis) Ap-1, respectively. Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis confirmed that AbAp-1 gene expression is constitutive in all selected tissues. AbAp-1 was upregulated in gills after bacteria (Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahemolyticus and Lysteria monocytogenes) challenge; and, upregulated in hemocytes and gills by viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) challenge. Shell damage and tissue injury also increased the transcriptional level of Ap-1 in mantle together with other transcription factors (NF-kB, LITAF) and proinflammatory TNF-alpha.

However, little is known about the involvement of other 5-HT receptor subfamilies in the reproduction process. In the present study, we identified the cDNAs encoding eight subtypes of 5-HT receptors from the ganglia tissues of the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai (Mollusca; Gastropoda; Haliotidae), and examined the gonadal expression of the transcripts of 5-HT receptors. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that the molluskan 5-HT receptors are largely classified into four major clades: 5-HT1/5/7, 5-HT2, 5-HT4, and 5-HT6. Among the H. discus hannai (Hdh) 5-HT1-7 transcripts, HdhS-HT1B, 4A, 4B, and 6 were the major subtypes detected in the mature ovary.

In Hdh5-HT4A-expressing HEK293 cells, forskolin-stimulated CRE-Luc and SRE-Luc reporter activities were both marginally increased by treatment with a high dose of 5-HT.

Stable isotopes of carbon suggest that brown algae and/detritus are a more important source of carbon than red algae. Fatty acid analysis confirmed the larger contribution of brown algae to the diet of abalone, and also identified the bacterial and diatom component of detritus to be an important contributor to abalone diet.

However, the morphology and structure of its visual organs and the mechanisms underlying its perception of cyclical light variations are unknown. This study analyzed the Retinalbinding protein (RALBP) gene to elucidate its role in the abalone's visual system. Using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique, the RALBP gene was cloned, revealing an open reading frame (ORF) of 1188 bp encoding 396 amino acids.

This purified recombinant protein was used as an antigen to generate a polyclonal antibody, with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results indicating an antibody potency of >= 512 K. Immunofluorescence assays demonstrated strong RALBP signals in the pigment epithelial and photoreceptor cell layers of the retina, with no detection in other retinal layers. To evaluate circadian expression patterns of RALBP under different light spectra, including full-spectrum natural light, short-wavelength blue light (450 nm), and long-wavelength orange light (560 nm), western blotting and the Cosinor program were utilized. The results revealed significant cosine rhythmic expression of RALBP under all light conditions (P < 0.05), with higher expression levels during the day compared to the night (P < 0.05). This is the first study that provides insights into the morphological and structural characteristics of the abalone retina and demonstrates that the abalone's ability to detect cyclical light changes is determined by the diurnal expression of RALBP.

This method involved treating postlarvae on diatom-depleted plates with a garlic juice (GJ) solution to facilitate detachment, followed by transfer to newly diatom-precoated plates for further growth in the nursery. We investigated the effects of garlic juice concentration (GJC) and animal size on detachment and mortality rates using a two-factor design. Our negative binomial regression analysis uncovered significant impacts of both factors and their interactions on the target traits. We noticed that the optimal GJC for smaller groups of abalone postlarvae (2.2 +/- 1.0 mm) was 0.7 %, while for larger groups (3.8 +/- 2.2 mm), it increased to 1.0 %. Notably, suitable GJC concentrations during post-treatment recovery resulted in no apparent mortality in Pacific abalone postlarvae. Our study demonstrated the effectiveness of the transfer nursery method, showing an improvement of over similar to 1.1 mm in shell length and a 43.1 % increase in survival during a 30-day experiment. Our study presents a significant advancement, as it likely introduces the first reported method of large-scale postlarval removal of H. discus hannai for prolonged nursery periods with sufficient diatom provision. The integration of GJ treatment and the transfer nursery method exhibited promising results, highlighting the benefits of its application for enhancing husbandry procedures, nursery management, and the overall industrial productivity of Pacific abalone.",10.1016/j.aqrep.2024.102194,"Wu, Fucun/0000-0001-9887-8046",2352-5134,,,JUN,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2024.102194,

This study describes a novel submerged cage culture system for abalone rearing in Fujian, South China. The cage consisted of five vertical slots that were oriented perpendicular to the flow of water. The slots were separated by six vertically connected plastic plates for abalone attachment and shelter at the bottom of the cage. Experiment 1 was designed to determine the appropriate stocking density at the start of the abalone sea-based production cycle. Eight-month-old hatchery reared and size-graded juveniles were transferred to the sea-based culture system. For different stocking densities, shell length of juveniles obtained in this novel culture system on 2, 3.5 and 5months, respectively, was compared with shell lengths obtained in a traditionally multi-tier basket culture system. In Experiment 2, daily growth rates (DGRs) in shell length and biomass in terms of wet weight of 2-year-old abalones reared in cage and tiered basket culture systems were compared over a 6-month period. Results of Experiment 1 showed that growth of abalone in the cage culture system is density-dependent; the mean final shell length of juveniles obtained was 6.715.9% higher than in tiered baskets system even at the same initial stocking density. In Experiment 2, DGRs in shell length of 53.8378.38mday1 obtained in cage system were significantly higher than that in tiered baskets (P<0.01). And in terms of wet weight biomass, it was 1.483.01 times higher in the cage system compared with the traditional system. Abalone survival was more than 87.5% in both culture systems in both experiments. Advantages of the newly established cage culture system included better growth performance of the animals reared and potential improvement of rearing conditions, such as improved water flow velocity and dissolved oxygen.",10.1111/j.1365-2109.2012.03185.x,,1355-557X,1365-2109,,FEB,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2012.03185.x,

About 63% of the energy content of the food consumed (C) is lost as faeces (F) and a further 32% expended on respiration (R). Energy losses in the form of ammonia excretion aree negligible, accounting for less than 1% of consumption. Some 5% of energy intake, or 13% of absorbed ration (Ab) is thus available for growth and reproductive output (Pg and Pr). In juveniles (< 100 mm) this is all allocated towards somatic growth, while in adults an increasing proportion of production is expended on reproductive output. Although feeding, respiration and excretion rates all increase with temperature the proportions of energy allocated to the various components of the energy budget appear to be consistent. Population energy budgets are calculated from density and size distribution surveys at two study sites. At Marcus Island, on the Cape west coast, the population has a standing stock of 82 g (wet flesh weight) m-2 consumes about 3260 KJm-2 yr-1 algae and has a P/.hivin.B ratio of 0.46, whereas at Cape Hangklip, on the Cape south coast, the population biomass is 133 gm-2, consumes 8613 KJm-1yr-1 and has a P/.hivin.B ratio of 0.70.

This study examined the influence of temperature on the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of oral OTC treatments on WS-RLP infected red abalone, H. rufescens. Medication was administered in an artificial diet containing 1.85% active OTC at a rate of 103.4 mg/kg abalone for 10, 20 and 30 days at both 13.4 C and 17.3 degrees C. Drug residue concentrations, WS-RLP burden and WS-associated pathological changes within foot muscle and digestive gland were measured 3,17, 23, 42, 63, 81,102,122, and 160 days after OTC treatment. In all samples the highest concentrations of OTC were detected on the first sample day. Furthermore, all sampling periods showed significantly less OTC in foot muscle samples relative to corresponding digestive gland samples (p<0.001). While drug deputation occurred rapidly from foot muscle, unusually high concentrations and long deputation times were measured within the digestive gland. The pharmacokinetic trends in both the foot muscle and digestive gland at 13.4 C were adequately described by a one-compartment model, while the digestive gland deputation models within the 17.3 degrees C treatments conformed to a two-compartment model. At both temperatures treatment duration gave rise to significant differences in OTC accumulation and depletion (p<0.001). Despite this, terminal elimination rate constants were similar. Estimated half-lives were similar among all treatments for digestive gland (23.8-27.5 d) and all treatments for the foot muscle at 13.4 degrees C (10.7-13.4 d; calculated only for the 13.4 degrees C treatments). At both temperatures all three durations of drug treatment led to significant reductions in WS-RLP prevalence, foot muscle atrophy, and mortality. WS-RLP re-challenge trials initiated 44, 88, and 122 days following the 10-day treatment at 17.3 degrees C showed reduced susceptibility to re-infection for up to 88 days after treatment, suggesting that digestive gland OTC residues confer long-term resistance to pathogen. Atomic absorption spectroscopy conducted on both foot muscle and digestive gland found significantly higher concentrations of iron, zinc, and manganese in the digestive gland, offering an explanation behind the underlying mechanism of OTC retention for extended periods within this tissue.

Results suggested that storage caused protein oxidation in RTE abalone muscles during storage, reflected by increases in carbonyl group and disulfide bond contents, as well as decreases in free sulfhydryl group and amino acid contents, which also contributed to nutrient loss. Meanwhile, oxidation led to the degradation of proteins, especially collagen con-nective proteins, which caused decline in water hold capacity of RTE abalone muscles, ultimately resulting in decreases in shear force and hardness.

In the present study, thioredoxin 1 (named as VpTrx1) and thioredoxin-related protein (named as VpTrp14) were identified from Venerupis philippinarum, respectively. Similar to most Trx1s, VpTrx1 possessed all conserved features critical for the fundamental structure and function of Trx1s, such as the conserved catalytic residues (C-G-P-C), but lacked the other cysteine residues, while VpTrp14 contained the conserved motif (C-P-D-C). Quantitative Real-time PCR assay showed that VpTrx1 and VpTrp14 transcripts were distributed in a wide array of tissues most abundantly expressed in the hepatopancreas. The expression of VpTrp14 mRNA in the hepatopancreas was significantly up-regulated after exposure to 10 and 40 mu g/L Cd, while the VpTrx1 expression level was kept relatively constant. Both the expression levels of VpTrx1 and VpTrp14 in the hepatopancreas were induced after exposure to Cu, and increased to the peak value at 96 h under the 40 mu g/L Cu exposure. These results showed that VpTrp14 transcripts responded to metal stress more acutely than VpTrx1, and both Trxs responded to Cu stress more sensitively than Cd. Together, it was suggested that VpTrx1 and VpTrp14 perhaps played important roles in the antioxidant responses against metal stress in V. philippinarum. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) belong to a novel class of functional non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). They have a distinctive ring structure and are involved in various biological processes, including the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of muscle cells. The Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai is an economically valuable mollusk species cultivated in China. However, the modulation of muscle growth by circRNAs in this species is poorly understood. (2) Methods: In this study, we analyzed the muscle transcriptomes of 6 H. discus hannai specimens: three small (S_HD) and three large (L_HD) groups via RNA-seq and bioinformatics technology. (3) Results: The results indicated the presence of 11,744 circRNAs in abalone adductor muscle. Furthermore, the L_HD group had 250 significantly differentially expressed circRNAs (106 upregulated and 144 downregulated) relative to the S_HD group. Moreover, the bioinformatics assessment revealed that circRNAs were related to lipid transporter activity, lipid biosynthetic process, fat digestion and absorption, the single-organism metabolic process, the thyroid hormone signaling pathway, and the hippo signaling pathway, which regulates growth. Seventeen key candidate circRNAs were identified, and a core functional circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network associated with abalone muscle growth was described. Gene expression was verified using qRT-PCR, confirming the accuracy of the RNA-seq data. (4) Conclusion: Overall, this investigation furnishes novel evidence for the potential muscle growth modulatory mechanisms in Pacific abalone. These high-quality circRNA data of abalone muscle provide a reference for functional studies on the abalone genome.",10.3390/genes16010065,,,2073-4425,,JAN,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes16010065,39858612

In addition to the adverse effect on the abalone aquaculture industry, there is concern that this pest may become established among native stocks. Efforts to exterminate mature and immature stages of the sabellid have focused on the use of water-soluble toxic substances, coating shells with wax or other substances to smother the worms, or altering the osmotic environment without causing irreversible injury to the abalone. These approaches have not provided a dependable method for control of the polychaete. Exposure of sabellid-infested green and pink abalones (Haliotis fulgens and Haliotis corrugata) to temperatures near but below their upper thermal limits has produced the desired results. A 48-h exposure to 28.5 degrees C has effectively killed all life stages of the sabellids but caused only minor mortality among the abalone. An LD,,, 48-h upper limit for H. fulgens was confirmed at 31.5 degrees C; that for H. corrugata was established at 30.3 degrees C. Treated abalone placed in optimally circulated seawater and fed the standard food, Egregia menziesii, resumed normal growth and thenceforth displayed no further symptoms of sabellid infestation. The method is fully compatible with life requirements of the green and pink abalones, but would not be suitable for treatment of species (e.g., Haliotis rufescens) known to have upper lethal limits well below 28 degrees C.",,,0730-8000,,,DEC,,

The strains were phenotypically characterized and sequenced (16S rDNA). Strain GHrC11 was a Gram-positive coccobacillum, while strains GHrC13 and GHrC15 were Gram-negative bacilli. Strain GHrC11 was identified as Exiguobacterium sp. The strains GHrC13 and GHrC15 were identified as Vibrio splendidus. The effects of these strains for the development of early abalone postlarvae (2 days old) were evaluated following a completely randomized design with three replicates using 5-mL-volume Petri dishes as experimental units. The experiment considered two different bacterial concentrations of each strain (10(3) and 10(5) cells ml(-1)) and two controls (with and without the benthic diatom Navicula incerta). After 10 days of experimentation, the highest mortality (90 +/- A 5.8 %) and the lowest growth rate (4.1 +/- A 0.1 mu m day(-1)) were recorded for the strain GHrC11. In contrast, the lower mortality (16.7 +/- A 3.3 %) and the highest growth rate (11.2 +/- A 0.9 mu m day(-1)) corresponded to the control fed N. incerta. Our results suggest that pathogenic effects of these bacterial strains were stronger than any potential benefits derived from the ingestion of bacteria by early abalone postlarvae.

"Baldwin, J; Elias, JP; Wells, RMG; Donovan, DA","Energy metabolism in the tropical abalone, Haliotis asinina Linne:: Comparisons with temperate abalone species",2007,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,342,2,213,225,,"The abalone, Haliotis asinina, is a large, highly active tropical abalone that feeds at night on shallow coral reefs where oxygen levels of the water may be low and the animals can be exposed to air. It is capable of more prolonged and rapid exercise than has been reported for temperate abalone. These unusual behaviours raised the question of whether H. asinina possesses enhanced capacities for aerobic or anaerobic metabolism. The blood oxygen transport system of H. asinina resembles that of temperate abalone in terms of a large hemolymph volume, similar hemocyanin concentrations, and in most hemocyanin oxygen binding properties; however, absence of a Root effect appears confined to hemocyanin from H. asinina and may assist oxygen uptake when hemolymph pH falls during exercise or environmental hypoxia. During exposure to air, H. asinina reduces oxygen uptake by at least 20-fold relative to animals at rest in aerated seawater, and there is no significant ATP production from anaerobic glycolysis or phosphagen hydrolysis in the foot or adductor muscles. This slowing of metabolism may contribute to survival at lower water oxygen levels than normally encountered by most temperate abalone. While crawling speeds of H. asinina in water are not exceptionally high, an aerobic expansibility of 5.5-fold at speeds less than 20% of maximum is more than 2.7-fold greater than reported for several temperate abalone. The high aerobic expansibility also supports the enhanced frequency and duration of flipping behaviour without recourse to the additional inputs from anaerobic glycolysis required by other abalone. Metabolic profiles of foot and adductor muscles of H. asinina are similar to those of other abalone. Common features are low activities of enzymes unique to aerobic ATP production, relatively high activities of arginine kinase, tauropine and D-lactate dehydrogenase as the predominant pyruvate reductases, and low intracellular pH buffering capacities. It is concluded that the exceptional abilities of H. asinina for prolonged and rapid exercise are supported by higher rates of aerobic metabolism rather than any enhanced capacity for anaerobic muscle work. It is unexpected, and instructive, that the exceptional aerobic expansibility is not apparent in obvious adjustments of the blood oxygen delivery system or muscle properties associated with aerobic ATP production. The absence of a hemocyanin Root effect, and the extent to which both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism can be reduced may be special features that assist prolonged exercise and survival of H. asinina when environmental oxygen becomes limiting.

Highest homology with that of the Patella depressa (51.08 %) from multiple alignments and phylogenetic tree analyses revealed it is a direct orthologue of the vertebrate PPAR. Tissue distribution analysis demonstrated that PPAR was highly expressed in muscle and gill, with lower expression observed in the kidney, female gonad, and hepatopancreas.

Observed (naive) year1 survival averaged 10.2% (0-23% range) and was most influenced by site compared with lineage or size-at-outplant. Families survived in the approximate proportions that they were outplanted, and there was little support for an effect of size-at-outplant on survival. etection was low due to the small chance of sighting individuals on complex substrate. When derived from repeated sampling, an upper bound on naive detection rate averaged 0.38 and increased with size. When derived from a closed capture-recapture model, average detection was estimated at 0.19. Growth was highly variable and confounded with detection, but an average 3.4% of detected outplants across all sites (0-7.5% range) had reached reproductive size in 2017.

Abalones are aquaculture resources of great importance to the international food market. However, abalone cultivation faces a problem of food availability depending on the season, especially in Mexico.Goals. This study aimed to formulate diets for juvenile Haliotis fulgens from hydrolyzed algae.Methods. We evaluated the physicochemical parameters of the diets and their acceptability to juveniles H. fulgens. Three diets were formulated from different algae species: 1) Macrocystis pyrifera (MP), 2) Eisenia arborea (EA) and 3) mixture of both algae (MPEA). The total amount of hidrolyzed alga in each diet was 26%. Fresh E. arborea blades and the ABKELP (R) commercial diet were used as negative and positive control, respectively. Finally, the toughness, stability and acceptability of each diet were determined at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h.Results. The toughness and stability of all hydrolyzed algae diets were significantly different (p > 0.05) compared to the those of positive and negative controls. The toughness of the MP, EA and MPEA diets ranged from 600-630 g cm(-2), whereas the ABKELP diet was tougher (700 g cm(-2)) after 24 h. The stability of the formulated diets was > 80%, while the ABKELP control reached 95% at 24 h. Overall ABKELP stability was significantly higher than those of the other diets (p < 0.01). The EA, MPEA, and ABKELP diets were more attractive to organisms than fresh E. arborea, although no significant differences in food intake were present (p < 0.05).Conclusions. All formulated diets exhibited physicochemical and acceptability characteristics that are suitable for H. fulgens.",,,0188-8897,,,SEP-DEC,,

In laboratory experiments designed to mimic seawater chemistry in future oceans, we examined the effect of pH reduction, driven by the carbon dioxide (CO2) acidification of seawater, on larvae of the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens. Following development under CO2-acidified conditions, we measured 2 indicators of physiological response to low pH in 4 stages of larval development: (1) tolerance of acute thermal challenges and (2) quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction-determined expression of 2 genes involved in shell formation (engrailed and ap24). The results showed that low pH (pH 7.87 vs. pH 8.05 for control treatments) had a significant effect and decreased larval thermal tolerance for some developmental stages (pretorsion and late veliger), but not for others (posttorsion and premetamorphic veligers). In contrast to the thermal tolerance data, decreased pH did not affect the expression pattern of the 2 shell formation genes in any of the abalone larval stages. The results indicate larval stages were differentially sensitive to low pH conditions and this variability may play into the resilience of individual species to withstand environmental change in the longer term.",10.2983/035.029.0220,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,AUG,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.029.0220,

Long-term geographical isolation resulted in genetic variation between the northern and southern C. ariakensis populations. In this study, the reproductive isolation between two independent population of C. ariakensis was evaluated by hybridization. Results showed that the fertilization rate, cleavage rate and D Larval rate of interpopulation hybrids (NS-northern male x southern female and SN- southern male x northern female) were significantly lower than those of intrapopulation inbreed groups (SS and NN). Moreover, southern maternal larvae (SS and NS) have significant survival advantages. The growth trend between the two sites was very different in early stage (from 90th to 210th day), but it was consistent in late stage (from 210th to 480th day), with a significant decreasing trend of SS > NS > SN > NN. The survival rates of SN and NS was significantly higher than that of NN, indicating that the high temperature tolerance and stress resistance of hybrids were improved. The positive maternal effect advantages (MEAs) at most time points of both sites demonstrated that parental origin, especially the maternal origin, had a significant effect on the survival and growth of progeny. Hybrid advantages (HAs) for growth of both sites were opposite, and positive HAs of survival accounted for most of both sites, indicating that environmental conditions and survival could significantly affect the growth, and interpopulation hybrids did not necessarily always show positive HAs. Moreover, the maternal origin would affect the shell shape and shell hardness, resulted in NS similar to SS and SN similar to NN, respectively. Additionally, all interpopulation hybrids could produce mature gametes. These results confirmed that there was no serious reproductive isolation between the two populations.

A total of 100 families was produced from a hierarchical mating design using 29 males and 88 females. Larvae from each family were settled and grown in separate ranks until tagged at the age of 10 months, at which time individuals from all families were reared in one common environment, but at two farms, until the age of 24 months. After tagging, the abalone were fed with the macro algae species Palmaria palmata and Laminaria digitata. The mean survival rate of the population was estimated at 9.6% at the age of 4 months, with large variation among families where the highest survival was 31.5% but the lowest 0.02%. The average shell length at the age of 8, 10, 18, and 24 months old was 13.10, 15.88, 34.99, and 50.90 mm, respectively.

Performance and nitrogen partitioning within an abalone (Haliotis tuberculata) and macroalgae culture system",1998,AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING,17,4,215,239,,"A pilot-scale system for the intensive land-based culture of abalone was established using an integrated design aimed at eliminating the dependence on external food sources, whilst reducing water requirements and nutrient discharge levels. The system was the first and simplest trial in a series of progressive complexity of the concept of integrated culture of seaweed, abalone, fish and clams in modular and intensive land-based facilities. Relative sizes of the modules, their stocking densities and the rate of nutrient supply were determined based on earlier results to be optimal. Effluents from two abalone (Haliotis tuberculata) culture tanks drained into macroalgae (Ulva lactuca or Gracilaria conferta) culture and biofilter tanks, where nitrogenous waste products contributed to the nutrition of the algae; net algal production from each algal tank was harvested and used to provide a mixed diet for the abalone. Excess algal yield was used elsewhere. The system was monitored to assess productivity and nitrogen partitioning over a year, while improvements were made based on the accumulating results. Total annual N-budgets were combined with mean production figures to determine a suitable ratio of abalone biomass to algal culture vessel productivity, towards commercial application of the concept. The abalone grew on average 0.26% and 0.25% body weight/d in the two culture tanks; reduced growth and increased food conversion ratios (food eaten/biomass gain; w/w) were associated with high summer water temperatures (max. 26.9 degrees C). U. lactuca showed reliable growth and filtration performance (mean production of 230 g fresh weight/m(2)/d, removing on average 58% of nitrogen supplied). Conversely, G. conferta growth was highly erratic and was deemed unsuitable for the current application. It is estimated that 1 kg of abalone biomass would require food supplied by 0.3 m(2) of U. lactuca culture, reducing N inputs required by 20% and N in effluent by 34% when compared to the two organisms grown in monoculture.

Here, we used an existing multi species model with smooth continuous functions that were modified to include thresholds representing 3 alternative scenarios of predator responses when prey numbers drop below a critical threshold: (I) no threshold-like response; (II) an abrupt decrease in breeding success by 90%, and (III) an abrupt halving of adult survival. Second, we analysed field observations from 3 independent marine case studies (abalone, starfish, penguins) for evidence of abrupt non-linear responses of predators to changes in abundance of principal prey. Third, we compared the model output with empirical results and tested (using both a statistical method and by fitting multispecies models) the 3 alternative response scenarios. With this approach, we found evidence for nonlinear changes in population parameters (such as survival rate) of predators as prey numbers declined below critical thresholds.

It also takes part in the host immune defense mainly via its ability to bind to iron (III) ions. Hence, transferrin is also identified as an important acute-phase protein in host immunity. Abalones are major shellfish aquaculture crops that are susceptible to a range of marine microbial infections. Since transferrin is known to be a major player in innate immunity, in the present study we sought to identify, and molecularly and functionally characterize a transferrin-like gene from disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) named as AbTrf. AbTrf consisted of a 2187-bp open reading frame (ORF) which encodes a 728 amino acid (aa) protein. The putative amino acid sequence of AbTrf harbored N- and C-terminal transferrin-like domains, active sites for iron binding, and conserved cysteine residues. A constitutive tissue specific AbTrf expression pattern was detected by qPCR in abalones where mantle and muscle showed high AbTrf expression levels. Three immune challenge experiments were conducted using Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes and LPS as stimuli and, subsequently, AbTrf mRNA expression levels were quantified in gill and hemocytes in a time-course manner. The mRNA expression was greatly induced in both tissues in response to both challenges. Evidencing the functional property of transferrins, recombinant AbTrf N-terminal domain (AbTrf-N) showed dose-dependent iron (III) binding activity detected by chrome azurol S (CAS) assay system. Moreover, recombinant AbTrf-N could significantly inhibit the growth of iron-dependent bacterium, Escherichia coli in a dose-dependent manner. However, AbTrf-N was unable to show any detectable bacteriostatic activity against iron-independent bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) even at its highest concentration. Collectively, our results suggest that AbTrf might play a significant role in the host innate immunity, possibly by withholding iron from pathogens. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This growth should use technologies with economical and environmental sustainability. Feed accounts for about half the cost in current high-volume fed mono-species aquaculture, mainly fish net pens or shrimp/fish ponds, yet most of this feed becomes waste. The resulting environmental impact and rising feed costs therefore hamper further growth of such farms. As in certain traditional polyculture schemes, plants can drastically reduce feed use and environmental impact of industrialized mariculture and at the same time add to its income. These nutrient-assimilating photoautotrophic plants use solar energy to turn nutrient-rich effluents into profitable resources. Plants counteract the environmental effects of the heterotrophic fed fish and shrimp and restore waterquality. Today's integrated intensive aquaculture approaches, developed from traditional extensive polyculture, integrate the culture of fish or shrimp with vegetables, microalgae, shellfish and/or seaweeds. Integrated mariculture can take place in coastal waters or in ponds and can be highly intensified. Today's technologies are well studied and documented. They are generic, modular and adaptable for several culture combinations of fish, shrimp, shellfish, abalone, sea urchin and several species of commercially important seaweeds and vegetables. A I-ha land-based integrated seabream-shellfish-seaweed farm can produce 25 tons of fish, 50 tons of bivalves and 30 tons fresh weight of seaweeds annually. Another farm model can produce in I ha 55 tons of seabream or 92 tons of salmon, with 385 or 500 fresh weight of seaweed, respectively, without pollution. Preliminary calculations show a potential for high profitability with large integrated farms. Several freshwater integrated fish-vegetable farms and a couple of modem fish-algae-shellfish/abalone integrated mariculture farms exist today, and several additional farms are planned. Three major international R&D projects promise to soon expand the horizons of the technology further. Therefore, modem integrated systems in general, and seaweed-based systems in particular, are bound to play a major role in the sustainable expansion of world aquaculture. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Microplastics (MPs) and plastic additives have raised global concern due to their widespread use in aquatic environments, bioaccumulation in tissues, and toxic effects in aquatic organisms. Despite showing sublethal toxicity in many cases, mechanisms underlying these emerging pollutants are underexplored. In this review, adverse effects and recent ecotoxicoproteomic studies of MPs and typical additives (i.e. plasticizers, flame retardants, antioxidants, and UV stabilizers) in aquatic organisms are summarized. Proteomics data show that MPs adversely affect ingestion and reproduction via disrupting pathways related to energy metabolism, stress-related defense, and cytoskeletal dynamics. Biological processes including lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis, skeletal development, neurotransmitter signaling, and immune response are modulated by additives and induce developmental malformations in fish embryos/larvae. Furthermore, plastic additives also exert reproductive toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and neurotoxicity in invertebrates (e.g. mussel, abalone, and oyster) and fish by disrupting detoxification/oxidative stress, hormonal modulation, signal transduction, and apoptosis.

On the other hand, the expression level of HdPI3K in haemocytes was higher than other tissues. Under normal condition, the gene expression level of HdAKT, HdPI3K, and other PI3K-AKT signaling pathway members were significantly up -regulated by Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection which demonstrated that HdAKT, HdPI3K, and other PI3K-AKT signaling pathway members play a role in the innate immune system of abalone. The mRNA expression of these genes in gills, haemocytes and hepatopancreas was significantly down regulated after the Vibrio parahaemolyticus stimulation with environment stimulation (thermal, hypoxia and thermal & hypoxia). These results indicate that the dual/multiple stresses defeat the immune system and lead to immunosuppression in abalone. PI3K-AKT signaling pathway may be involved in hypoxia/thermal-induced immunosuppression of small abalone Haliotis diversicolor. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

After a long period of cultivation, several varieties of S. japonica have been developed in Korea and China. In this study, we conducted aquacultural research on the persistence of thalli from two kelp cultivars, one from China (Huangguan No. 1) and one from Korea (Sugwawon No. 301), between December 2015 and November 2016 in Haenam, Korea. The maximum length was 247.8 +/- 13.0 and 227.5 +/- 42.0 cm, respectively, which were significantly longer in Sugwawon No. 301 than in Huangguan No. 1. The maximum width was 29.9 +/- 5.4 and 23.2 +/- 1.9 cm, respectively, which were significantly wider in Huangguan No. 1 than in Sugwawon No. 301. The mean biomass obtained from the culture ropes was for Sugwawon No. 301 was 3.5 +/- 0.3 kg wet wt m(-1) and for while Huangguan No. 1 was 3.1 +/- 1.0 kg wet wt m(-1) of culture rope. After August, the persistence of the thalli of Sugwawon No. 301 was two months longer than that of Huangguan No. 1. We found that the Sugwawon No. 301 performed as well as the Huangguan No. 1 in Korean waters possibly due to increased flexibility as a result of the different cell arrangements of the two cultivars. Overall, the use of the Sugwawon No. 301 cultivar rather than the Huangguan No. 1 cultivar of S. japonica appears the best alternative to help to ensure a stable year round algal feed supply for the Korean abalone industry.",10.4490/algae.2018.33.2.4,,1226-2617,2093-0860,,MAR,http://dx.doi.org/10.4490/algae.2018.33.2.4,

The wet body weight (BW) and test diameter growth were monitored at 2-month intervals during the experiment. At the conclusion of the experiment, the surviving sea urchins were counted and the gonad wet weight (GW) and gonad color were measured. Specific growth rate (SGR) of body weight, survival rate (SR), gonad index (GI), gonad color difference (Delta E (00)), coefficients of variation (CV) of BW, GW, GI and Delta E (00), total biomass yield (TY) and total gonad yield (TGY) per cage were calculated. Two marketable yield variables, graded according to gonad index, i.e., marketable biomass yield (MY) and marketable gonad yield (MGY), were also calculated. Coefficient of variation of final body weight (FW) and final test diameter (FTD) of sea urchins increased as the stocking density increased, indicating the existence of adverse social interactions. These adverse social interactions detrimentally affected FW, FTD, SGR, GW and GI (P < 0.01). Although SR decreased with the increasing densities, no statistical significant difference was detected. Sea urchins at D15 had the lowest gonad color difference (Delta E (00)) (P < 0.05). However, statistically equal CV of Delta E (00) indicates this density effect was not a result of adverse social interactions. TY and TGY increased with increased density and can be described by the following equations: TY = 84.18X (0.64), R (2) = 0.999 and TGY = 24.16X (0.38), R (2) = 0.979. However, the MY and MGY were not significantly different among stocking densities.

Northern abalone occur in a wide range of habitats from fairly sheltered bays to exposed coastlines. However, not all habitats are likely to support high abalone densities with large northern abalone that have high fecundity. Therefore, habitats that can support dense concentrations of large abalone would be better suited for aggregation rebuilding projects. Several experimental rebuilding projects are currently underway; the experimental sites were, in general, selected based on abalone presence and relative abundance. This study attempts to describe abalone habitat suitable for rebuilding efforts by using data from surveys completed at the start of the large decline of abalone densities observed in British Columbia (BC). Several areas were surveyed to determine abalone density on the southeast coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands and the north central mainland coast of BC between 1978 and 1980. Habitat data were recorded after each dive, including substrate types and dominant algae cover and species. Four categories of algal types were analyzed based on height and growth patterns: (1) canopy; (2) understorey (large bottom cover); (3) turf (short bottom cover); and (4) encrusting. In addition, an index of wave exposure was also calculated for each site surveyed. Northern abalone density was inversely correlated to mean abalone shell lengths. The exposure index was correlated positively to abalone density but negatively to mean shell length. Regression tree classifications successfully separated habitats of high and low abalone densities, but these differed from habitats classified using mean shell length as the response variable. To optimize rebuilding efforts, a compromise between the two classification models, one with density as the response variable and the other with mean shell length, may have to be developed.",10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[677:DNAHKH]2.0.CO;2,,0730-8000,,,SEP,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[677:DNAHKH]2.0.CO;2,

Large (102.23 +/- 1.79 mm in height and 24 mo old) and small (52.47 +/- 2.08 mm in height and 14 mo old) oysters were divided respectively into two groups: Group H was fed a high quantity of microalgae (approximately 2 x 10(6) cells mL(-1) at a rate of 1.0 L per oyster per day) to enhance gonad development, whereas Group L was fed a low quantity of microalgae (same cell concentrations but at a rate of 0.15 L per oyster per day) to minimize changes in their dry meat weight and NRR time. The results showed that prior to spawning the decrease in lysosomal membrane stability in Group H were negatively correlated with the changes in dry meat weight. After spawning. the dry meat weight reduced to a level that was not significantly different from their initial values on day 0. This indicates that prior to spawning the increase in dry meat weight mainly resulted from the growth of gonad tissue, and thus the stress experienced by the oysters during this period was mainly related to gametogenesis or its related metabolism and/or biological functions. The results also showed that spawning further impaired lysosomal membrane stability (P < 0.05). After spawning the NRR times remained at the lowest recorded levels for a period before recovering to levels corresponding with the water temperature in which the annuals were maintained. The smaller oysters recovered from the stress of spawning much faster than the larger animals (P < 0.05).

This study investigated the metabolic rates and use of biochemical reserves in two species of abalone, Haliotis fulgens (the green abalone) and H. sorenseni (the white abalone). Larvae of H. fulgens utilized triacylglycerol as a primary source of endogenous energy reserves for development (similar to50% depletion from egg to metamorphic competence). Amounts of phospholipid remained constant, and protein dropped by about 30%. After embryogenesis, larvae of H. fulgens had oxygen consumption rates of 81.7 +/- 5.9 (SE) pmol larva(-1) h(-1) at 15 degreesC through subsequent development. The loss of biochemical reserves fully met the needs of metabolism, as measured by oxygen consumption. Larvae of H. sorenseni were examined during later larval development and were metabolically and biochemically similar to H. fulgens larvae at a comparable stage.

Here we evaluate the duck's ecology by combining a stable isotopic evaluation of its feeding niche with records of human predation and climatic variation to evaluate (1) alternative influences on the duck's extinction and (2) possible ecological consequences of its disappearance. Results indicate that a mid-late Holocene increase in human population density coincided with a decrease in mean sea surface temperatures (SST) and an increase in SST variance, all of which were contemporaneous with the demise of the flightless duck ca. 2500 cal BP. Climate appears to be a main exogenous driver of this extinction event by not only negatively impacting flightless duck food availability, but positively impacting one of the duck's main predators: humans. Isotopic findings indicate the duck had a unique feeding ecology that overlapped equally with analog species reliant mostly on marine invertebrates (sea otters [Enhydra lutris]) and on fish (harbor seals [Phoca vitulina]). This dietary niche overlap suggests the duck's extinction could have opened foraging opportunities for harbor seals and sea otters. Otter numbers appear to have increased coincident with the duck's decline which also correlates with a decrease in size and abundance of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens), one of the otter's preferred prey. These correlations suggest that new feeding opportunities may have emerged for otters in the face of the duck's extinction, encouraging an increase in otter populations, which then had negative impacts on abalone that also were targeted by humans. Overall findings suggest the possibility of an unanticipated prehistoric precursor to the historic baseline of this nearshore ecosystem. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

The freshwater pulmonate Physa acuta is a sensitive organism to xenobiotics appropriate for aquatic toxicity testing in environmental studies. This study was conducted to explore the effects of BPA on the Gastropoda endocrine system. The effects following a range of exposure times (5-96 h) to BPA in P. acuta were evaluated at the molecular level by analysing changes in the transcriptional activity of the endocrine-related genes oestrogen receptor (ER), oestrogen-related receptor (ERR), and retinoid X receptor (RXR), as well as in genes involved in the stress response, such as lisp70 and hsp90. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that BPA induced a significant increase in the mRNA levels of ER, ERR, and RXR, suggesting that these receptors could be involved in similar pathways or regulation events in the endocrine disruptor activity of this chemical at the molecular level in Gastropoda. Additionally, the hsp70 expression was upregulated after 5 and 72 h of BPA exposures, but hsp90 was only upregulated after 5 h of BPA exposure. Finally, we assessed the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity after BPA treatment and found that it was affected after 48 h. In conclusion, these data provide, for the first time, evidences of molecular effects produced by BPA in the endocrine system of Gastropoda, supporting the potential of ER, ERR and RXR as biomarkers to analyse putative EDCs in ecotoxicological studies.

Protein-protein molecular docking revealed that the coiled-coil region of Hdh-HSBP1 binds to the coiled-coil region of HdhHSF1. Tissue expression analysis demonstrated that the highest Hdh-HSBP1 expression occurred in the DG, whereas seasonal expression analysis revealed that this gene was most highly expressed in summer. In heatstressed abalone, the highest expression of Hdh-HSBP1 occurred at 30 degrees C. Moreover, time-series analysis revealed that the expression of this gene began to increase significantly at 6 h post-heat stress, with higher expression observed at 12 h and 24 h post-heat stress. Furthermore, Hdh-HSBP1 mRNA expression showed a link to ROS production. Additionally, the expression of Hdh-HSBP1 showed significantly higher expression in the early stages of embryonic development in Pacific abalone. These results suggest that Hdh-HSBP1 plays a crucial role in the stress physiology of Pacific abalone by interacting with Hdh-HSF1, as well as its embryonic development.",10.1016/j.fsi.2024.109660,"Kho, Kang Hee/0000-0001-8731-6101; Sukhan, Zahid Parvez/0000-0001-8098-5986",1050-4648,1095-9947,,AUG,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2024.109660,38830519

Gut microbiota plays critical roles in the physiological functions of aquatic animals, and it is influenced by numerous factors. Previous studies about the gut microbiota of abalone usually focused on analyzing bacterial taxonomy or the impact of a single abiotic factor. However, the effect of abiotic factors, combined with biotic factors (i.e., genotype), on gut microbiota of abalone has not been systematically explored. In China, the hybrid Haliotis discus hannai. x H. fulgens. has potential for large-scale farming in southern China by its fast growth rate and tolerance to higher temperature. In this study, we analyzed the effects of diet, temperature and genotypes on gut microbiota of abalones using 16S rRNA gene sequencing data. The experiments indicate that the top three dominant genera keep consistent across various temperatures, diets and genotypes. The alpha-diversity of the microbial community was affected by temperature, genotype and diet. On the whole, the alpha-diversity of the gut microbiota of H. discus hannai was higher than that of the hybrid under the same temperature or diet. For beta-diversity, the microbial samples exhibited clear groups under abiotic gradients of temperature and diet. Some of the identified temperature-specific and diet-specific OTUs and KEGG Orthologs are related with degradation of carrageenan, laminaran and agar; metabolism of carbohydrate; biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and antibiotics, etc. According to permutational multivariate ANOVA, temperature and diet could explain almost 52% of bacterial structure variation. The gut microbiota of the two abalone genotypes have different responses to environmental gradients of temperature and diet. The gut microbiota of H. discus hannai is more sensitive to temperature, while the hybrid is more sensitive to diet, which might be the potential explanation of its tolerance to higher temperature in breeding. This study makes the first attempt to correlate the structural variation of gut microbiota in abalone by considering both abiotic and biotic factors.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735269,,0044-8486,1873-5622,,Jul-15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735269,

An important aetiological agent of this disease is bacteria of the genus Streptococcus; hence, exploring the mechanisms of virulence in these bacteria is an extremely important step for the development of effective prevention programmes. The purpose of our study was to determine the ability to produce biofilm and the occurrence of selected invasiveness factors among bacteria of the genus Streptococcus isolated from cattle with the clinical form of mastitis in northeastern Poland. Results: Most of the isolates analysed demonstrated an ability to produce biofilm (over 70%). Virulence genes were searched for in the three most common streptococci in our experiment: S. agalactiae, S. uberis and S. dysgalactiae. For S. agalactiae, only four genes were confirmed: rib (33%), cylE (78%), bca (37%), and cfb (100%). The genes pavA, scpB, bac and lmb were not present in any of the tested strains. The dominant serotypes of the species were Ia (n = 8) and II (n = 8), in addition to some strains that were not classified in any of the groups (n = 6). Out of the eight selected genes for S. uberis (sua, pauA/skc, gapC, cfu, lbp, hasA, hasB, hasC), only one was not found (lbp). Finally, two genes were chosen for S. dysgalactiae (eno and napr), and their presence was confirmed in 76% and 86% of the strains, respectively. Conclusions: The experiment showed that strains of Streptococcus spp. isolated from dairy cattle with clinical cases of mastitis in the northeastern part of Poland possess several invasiveness factors that can substantially affect the course of the disease, and this should be considered when developing targeted prevention programmes.",10.1186/s12917-017-1322-y,"Kaczorek-Lukowska, Edyta/0000-0002-9962-0917; Malaczewska, Joanna/0000-0002-9693-6692; Wojcik, Roman/0000-0002-7405-6328",1746-6148,,,Dec-28,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-1322-y,29282118

Jian),2017,AQUACULTURE,474,,86,94,,"An 8-week feeding trial was conducted to determine the effect of dietary glutamine (Gln) on the erythrocyte function in juvenile Jian carp. The results indicated that dietary Gln caused significant increases in haematocrit, erythrocyte count, haemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular haemoglobin content in carp blood. Dietary Gln caused significant decreases in the levels of superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, met-haemoglobin, malonaldehyde and protein carbonyl and increases in the level of reduced glutathione and the activities of Na+, K+-ATPase and lactate dehydrogenase in carp erythrocytes. These results demonstrated that dietary Gln could improve the function of erythrocytes in fish. Meanwhile, the present study explored the effect of dietary Gln on hydroxyl radical (center dot OH)-induced apoptosis in carp erythrocytes. We found that dietary Gln prevented the center dot OH-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species and the oxidation of cellular components, and restoring the non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidant activities in fish erythrocytes. These results revealed that the effects of Gln on the function may be closely associated with apoptosis in fish erythrocytes. Moreover, our data suggested that dietary Gin raised the levels of alanine (Ala), citrulline (Cit) and proline (Pro) in plasma of carp. We then examined the protective effects of Ala, Cit and Pro at the physiological concentrations in center dot OH-induced carp erythrocytes. The results indicated that Ala, Cit or Pro at the physiological concentrations suppressed apoptosis and the oxidation of cellular components, and restored the GSH antioxidant system in the center dot OH-induced carp erythrocytes. Moreover, the combination of Ala, Cit and Pro at the physiological concentrations produces a greater protective effect than their individual effects in fish erythrocytes. These results displayed that the effects of Gln on erythrocytes are at least partly dependent on that of its metabolites in fish. Ala, Cit, Pro and their combination could serve as an antioxidant or apoptosis-inhibitor in fish.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.03.041,,0044-8486,1873-5622,,May-01,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.03.041,

However, challenges-such as Climate Change, Ocean Acidification and threats from pests-pose hurdles that cannot be overcome by the aquaculture sector alone. Robust collaboration between scientists and the industry is imperative to address these threats and ensure success. Climate Change and Ocean Acidification disrupt the reproduction and settlement of crops, hindering shell growth and increasing the risks of pest attacks. The projected annual cost of mitigating pest species will exceed NZD 150 million. While this figure has been economically evaluated, it does not account for the additional intensification from Ocean Acidification and Climate Change. Each of these factors, alone and in combination, poses a risk of collapse for farms. Collaboration between the industry and scientists is essential for developing solutions and advancing aquaculture practices. Establishing a balanced partnership is crucial for advancing New Zealand's aquaculture sector, ensuring sustainability and resilience against challenges. Although this perspective is based on taxonomy, developmental biology and shellfish aquaculture, the challenges and insights are applicable across various sectors.

Here, we propose a loss-or-gain survival model, represented by the ratio of cumulative stress span to life span, to quantify stress resilience at organismal level. As a proof of concept, this is demonstrated by reduced survival resilience in Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to exogenous oxidative stress induced by paraquat or with endogenous proteotoxic stress caused by polyglutamine or amyloid-beta aggregation. Based on this, we reveal that a hidden peptide (cryptide)-AbaPep#07 (SETYELRK)-derived from abalone hemocyanin not only enhances survival resilience against paraquat-induced oxidative stress but also rescues proteotoxicity-mediated behavioral deficits in C. elegans, indicating its capacity against stress and neurodegeneration. Interestingly, AbaPep#07 is also found to increase cost-free longevity and age-related physical fitness in nematodes. We then demonstrate that AbaPep#07 can promote nuclear localization of SKN-1/Nrf, but not DAF-16/FOXO, transcription factor. In contrast to its effects in wild-type nematodes, AbaPep#07 cannot increase oxidative stress survival and physical motility in loss-of-function skn-1 mutant, suggesting an SKN-1/Nrf-dependent fashion of these effects. Further investigation reveals that AbaPep#07 can induce transcriptional activation of immune defense, lipid metabolism, and metabolic detoxification pathways, including many SKN-1/Nrf target genes. Together, our findings demonstrate that AbaPep#07 is able to boost stress resilience and reduce behavioral frailty via SKN-1/Nrf-governed transcriptional reprogramming, and provide an insight into the health-promoting potential of antioxidant cryptides as geroprotectors in aging and associated conditions.",10.1111/acel.14046,"Huang, Zebo/0000-0003-2431-3741; Wang, Qiangqiang/0000-0002-5506-6539; mishra, ajay/0000-0001-8201-4067",1474-9718,1474-9726,,FEB,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/acel.14046,37990605

As lipid metabolism is closely linked with protein metabolism, protein intake during maturation may significantly influence transport proteins and enzyme activity which is responsible for supplying the essential fatty acids for gamete development. The present study investigated the influence of increased protein intake on the accumulation of certain long-chain PUFA in two species of commercially valuable sea urchin, Paracentrotus lividus and Psammechinus miliaris during maturation. Sea urchins were fed three macroalgal diets over a 90-day period. These diets included the red alga Palmaria palmata, which had been grown in seawater enriched with two levels of ammonia-N, which produced a high protein content (41%) or low protein content (32%). The third diet (or reference diet) used the brown macroalga Laminaria saccharina with a 23% protein content. The fatty acid composition of the gonads was determined by GC. Feeding the high protein diet had no effect on the maturation and total lipid in the gonad compared with the low protein diet, however, it did significantly increase the levels of docosahexaenoic acid DHA 22:6n-3 in the mature gonad tissue in P. miliaris and P. lividus. In contrast, only P. miliaris exhibited higher levels of arachidonic acid ARA 20:4n-6 when fed the high protein diet. The present study suggests that elevated protein levels can promote the accumulation of DHA and ARA in gonadal tissue during maturation, although the extent of the influence is species-specific and highlights the importance of understanding the complexities and inter-connectivity between protein and lipid metabolism when producing commercially valuable species.

Both products have substantial market demand and if the wastes of the abalone can be used as food for the sea cucumber, then both economic and sustainability goals could be addressed. Designing a simple but effective containment structure suitable for both animals, however, requires both engineering and scientific approaches. The first objective of this study was to investigate the flow field and dissolved oxygen exchange within two potential structure designs using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The second objective was to conduct a laboratory experiment, with the same containment structures, to determine if the sea cucumbers would use organic matter (food residues and feces) as a food source produced from the abalone and would show positive growth rates. The design of both containment structures included surfaces for both species to reside and move around. One of the structures utilized vertical plates with access holes between sections (called the UC) while the other was a combination of tube and plate sections (called the TC). The procedure included placing both structures in separate seawater flow through tank systems each with juvenile abalone and sea cucumbers for 7 months. The intent was to examine the growth rates of each set of animals under the same, external flow field conditions. During the experiments, only the abalone was fed. The CFD calculations were verified with tank measurements and indicated better dissolved oxygen exchange in the UC structure. Results of the sea cucumber growth experiments showed that the animals in the UC structure grew to 7.50 g from an initial wet weight value of 3.37 g. In the TC structure, however, the results were not as promising with total growth measured at 1.4 g from an initial wet weight of 3.61 g. During the 202 day experiment, specific growth rates of 0.40 and -0.47% in the UC and TC, were calculated respectively. For the abalone, a statistically significant growth rate difference was not evident between the containment structures. The study also found that the juvenile sea cucumber actually fed on biodeposits from the abalone and that the substantial difference in growth rates between structure types was due to the better flow rate in the UC.

As monitoring progresses and restoration efforts evolve to include population supplementation, a reliable and robust method of tagging individual abalone is needed. Current abalone tagging methods are unsatisfactory, particularly for long-term studies as a result of tag loss, shell erosion, and encrustation. Observing tag numbers of cryptically positioned abalone can be difficult. To obviate these issues, we evaluated passive integrated transponders (PITs) as tags for pinto abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana kamtschatkana). We applied 9-mm PITs with cyanoacrylate glue to the dorsal exterior of the shell and to the ventral anterior of the shell, and by injection into the foot muscle of small adults (trial I), and applied PITs to the ventral anterior of the shell of juveniles (trial 2). We subsequently tracked growth, survival, and tag retention over 15 mo in trial I and 6 mo in trial 2 in captivity. Among small adults (trial 1), differences in relative growth rate and survival were not significant. PIT retention by adhesion to the ventral anterior and dorsal exterior was significantly greater than injection into the foot in trial I. Between controls and tagged animals in trial 2, differences in survival were not significant. There was no significant difference in ventral anterior tag retention between trial 1 and trial 2. Gluing PITs on the ventral anterior of the shell is a promising method because abalone quickly formed nacre over the tags, incorporating them into the shell, which does not appear to affect tag detection by the PIT reader.

However, as infected abalones have been transported to Chile, China, Taiwan, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Spain, Thailand and Japan, the geographical range of the etiological agent is suspected to be broad, especially where California red abalones Haliotis rufescens are cultured or in areas where native species have been exposed to this species. Susceptibility varies among species, with up to 99% losses of black abalone H. cracherodii in laboratory and field studies in the USA to no losses among the small abalone H. diversicolor supertexta in Thailand. Some populations that have suffered catastrophic losses due to WS have developed resistance to the disease. In addition, a newly identified phage hyperparasite of the WS-RLO may reduce pathogenicity and dampen associated losses. Diagnosis of WS requires the identification of infection with the pathogen (WS-RLO detected via in situ hybridization or histology coupled with PCR and sequence analysis) accompanied by morphological changes that characterize this disease (e.g. pedal and digestive gland atrophy, and digestive gland metaplasia). A quantitative PCR assay was developed and may be useful in quantifying pathogen DNA.

Densities of 0-yr-old juvenile abalone (2010yr class) and the sea urchin Mesocentrotus nudus inhabiting the CCA largely decreased just after the earthquake and tsunami, mainly affected by the catastrophic disturbance by this event. After that, previously unrecorded recruitments of juvenile macroalgae were observed in the CCA after the event probably because of the large-scale removal of the primary herbivore, the sea urchin M.nudus. Subsequently, the KB and AT expanded into the previous CCA area. After the tsunami, the major factors causing the continuously low densities of the 0-yr-old juvenile abalone (2011-2013yr classes) are inferred to be the limited nursery CCA habitat because of mud and silt sedimentation, the expansion of the KB and AT, and/or the decreased densities of reproductive adult abalone due to the direct disturbance of the tsunami. The results of this study imply that maintaining diverse algal communities which enable the habitat shifts of juvenile abalone H.discus hannai is one of the crucial factors to their successful recruitment.",10.1111/fog.12191,"Takami, Hideki/0000-0001-5083-8539; Kawamura, Tomohiko/0009-0008-0086-7428",1054-6006,1365-2419,,MAR,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fog.12191,

The results demonstrated that the LMW-AV reduced a number of clinical symptoms, such as the severity of the dermatitis and serum immunoglobulin E levels. Moreover, LMW-AV could inhibit the expression of chemokines and cytokines.

In this study a neutral red retention (NRR) assay was used to investigate the effects of size and age on the response of Pacific oysters to changes in water temperature and their recovery after exposure to different air temperatures. Results from moving oysters directly between water temperatures of 5 degrees C and 15 degrees C, 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C and 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C demonstrated that different water temperature change affect the lysosomal membrane integrity differently. The NRR times of large and small oysters transferred directly between 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C initially decreased significantly, and then increased to levels corresponding to the new temperature. In addition, NRR times in large oysters responded at a significantly slower rate than small oysters when they were transferred from 5 degrees C and 25 degrees C to 15 degrees C water and between 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C water. Results from the air exposure experiments showed that, after exposure to air temperatures of 5 degrees C, 15 degrees C or 25 degrees C, the lysosomal membrane integrity of large oysters recovered at a slower rate in 15 degrees C water compared to small oysters. It therefore appears necessary to develop different management strategies for large (old) and small (young) oysters.

Similarly, growth and survival rates were assessed in spat cultured in different environments (outdoor and indoor), and juveniles grown in concrete tanks with different finished of the inner walls (gray rough finish, and white smooth walls with epoxy paint). A higher larval settlement was observed in substrates with artificial biofilm exposed to cold water (20 degrees C) for 24 h. Treatments with the stimulus of KCl and dibromo methane had toxic effects on larvae. There were not differences in the shell length of the settled larvae between stimuli, substrata or exposition time. Post-larvae fed with artificial biofilm had survival and growth rates similar to those maintained with benthic microalgae biofilm. The spat that were cultured in outdoor conditions showed a higher growth rate than those kept indoor, but the survival was similar in both cases.

Increasing mean sea surface temperature may alter the distribution of abalone species in the northeastern Pacific, although no apparent pattern has yet emerged. Ecophysiological observations (energy budget and the temperature performance curve based on scope for growth), satellite-derived daily sea surface temperature data, and observations of the population density distribution of wild abalones were integrated. The highest temperature-dependent scope for growth (physiological optimum) was discovered between 20.5 and 28.5 degrees C, peaking at 24 degrees C, with the upper thermal limit about 30 degrees C. Off the west coast of Baja California, the distribution of abalone appears to be dictated by the tradeoff between a mean temperature close to the physiological optimum and exposure to a highly variable environment (i.e., more stress and the risk of reaching suboptimal and lethal warm temperatures at the daily scale).

In this study, two novel invertebrate TLRs from disk abalone (designated as AbTLR-A and AbTLR-B) were identified and functionally characterized for the first time. AbTLR-A and AbTLR-B comprised the typical TLR domain architecture containing an extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain, transmembrane domain, and Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain. Expressional analysis revealed that both TLRs were constitutively expressed at all the early embryonic stages of disk abalone analyzed, with the highest level of AbTLR-A found at the 16-cell stage and AbTLR-B at the trochophore stage. According to tissue distribution analysis, prominent mRNA expression of AbTLR-A and AbTLR-B was detected in the hemocytes and gills, respectively.

"Sakai, M",Current research status of fish immunostimulants,1999,AQUACULTURE,172,1-Feb,63,92,,"Immunostimulants are valuable for the control of fish diseases and may be useful in fish culture. The immunostimulatory effects of glucan, chitin, lactoferrin and levamisole for fish and shrimp have been reported. Nutritional factors such as Vitamins B and C, growth hormone and prolactin have also been reported to be immunostimulators. These immunostimulants mainly facilitate the function of phagocytic cells and increase their bactericidal activities. Several immunostimulants also stimulate the natural killer cells, complement, lysozyme and antibody responses of fish. The activation of these immunological functions is associated with increased protection against infectious disease. Resistance to bacterial pathogens such as Vibrio anguillarum, V. salmonicida, Aeromonas salmonicida, Yersinia rukeri and Streptococcus spp. and to parasitic infections such as white spot disease can be increased by administration of immunostimulants, but not to intracellular pathogens such as Renibacterium salmoninarum and Pasteurella piscicida. The most effective method of administration of immunostimulants to fish is by injection. Oral and immersion methods have also been reported, but the efficacy of these methods decreases with long-term administration. Overdoses of several immunostimulants induce immunosuppression in fish. The side effects of immunostimulants have not been well-studied. Growth-promoting activity has been noted in fish or shrimp treated with glucan or lactoferrin. Immunostimulants can overcome immune suppression by sex hormones. Thus, the influence of immunostimulants in mature fish should be studied. In conclusion, immunostimulants can reduce the losses caused by disease in aquaculture; however, they may not be effective against all diseases. For the effective use of immunostimulants, the timing, dosages, method of administration and the physiological condition of fish need to be taken into consideration. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

In our present study, the marine gastropod Haliotis diversicolor was exposed to sublethal concentrations (0.01, 0.02, 0.04 and 0.08 mg L-1) of B(a)P for 7 d under laboratory conditions and the alterations of hematological parameters like haemocyte count, haemocyte viability, protein content and immune components like phenoloxidase, phagocytosis and superoxide anion generation were measured. In addition, the changes in lysozyme activity, antibacterial activity due to the effect of B(a)P on abalone were analysed. B(a)P was found to decrease significantly the total number of circulating haemocytes. Intracellular superoxide anion generation and phenoloxidase significantly increased on exposure to B(a)P, whereas phagocytic activity was decreased significantly at higher concentration. Significant alterations were found in the uptake of neutral red and the observed alterations of hematological parameters and immune components tested indicated the generation of immunotoxicological effects on abalone due to B(a)P exposure.

These relationships, studied mainly through neutral DNA markers, are not always consistent with actual biogeographic patterns or the evolutionary history of marine species. In addition, increased information at functional genomic level from non-model species allows the study of adaptive responses in marine populations. This work reports local transcriptomic patterns in populations of the mussel Mytilus chilensis and their correspondence with oceanographic variability in southern Chile. Analysis of gene expression patterns was conducted through qPCR of seven candidate genes involved in the response to environmental stress (HSP70, HSP90), iron metabolism (Ferritin), pathogens (Mytilin B, Defensin) and oxidative stress (SOD-CuZn, Catalase) in at five study sites located in southern Chile, from Valdivia (39 degrees 56'S-73 degrees 36'W) to Melinka (43 degrees 52'S-73 degrees 44'W). Multivariate and correlation analyses were used to assess the relationship between levels of individual gene expression and site features characterized using satellite data on surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration and total suspended sediments. Two main groups of sites with differential patterns of gene expression were identified. Individuals exposed to higher temperatures showed an overexpression of HSP70, HSP90 and Ferritin genes. The expression of SOD-CuZn and Catalase was correlated with local chlorophyll-a (i.e. food availability for mussels), although with opposite correlations. In addition, Mytilin B showed higher levels of expression in areas with higher freshwater influence. Patterns of gene expression across the region of interest suggest that spatial variability in environmental conditions induce phenotypic changes in different populations of the same mussel species. In addition, the analysis of expression patterns in candidate genes can reveal local patterns in populations where other molecular markers show no genetic structure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Chemical treatments (acetylcholine, potassium chloride, dopamine and glutamine) were then tested at various concentrations for their ability to modulate swimming behaviour and induce larval attachment and metamorphosis over 14 days. Generally, larval state shifted from swimming to attached, and from attached to metamorphosed, in the control and treatments over time. However, the peak percentage of attached and metamorphosed larvae varied in time among chemicals and concentrations. While overall percent metamorphosis was minimally enhanced after 14 days of exposure to some chemical treatments at certain concentrations, all treatments displayed significant capacities to down-regulate larval swimming and induce early attachment and metamorphosis.

The initial size, stocking density and sorting are among the first considerations when establishing an abalone culture system. This study aimed to investigate the effects of these factors on the growth of juvenile Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai Ino, during overwintering. Juvenile abalones were reared in multi-tier basket form for overwintering in open seawaters in southern China for 106 days. The daily growth rates (DGRs) in the shell length of all experimental groups ranged from 67.08 to 135.75 mu m day(-1), while the specific growth rates (SGRs) were 0.2447-0.3259% day(-1). Variance analysis indicated that both DGRs and SGRs in shell length were significantly affected by the initial body size and stocking density. Furthermore, the effects of stocking density on DGRs and SGRs varied with the initial size. However, sorting abalones according to their initial sizes may not be necessary in practice as sorting did not alter growth significantly at all densities in this study.

Quota holders have initiated research to assess the viability of stock enhancement by release of hatchery-reared seed. Boulder reefs (1 x 2 x 0.5 m) were constructed by placing natural boulders in wire baskets over sand or bedrock. These reefs allowed accurate census of small abalone during short-term experiments (3-4.5 mo.) examining the effects of seed size [5-25 mm shell length (SL)] and density (25-640 m(-2) of seafloor) on survival and growth. Survival increased with seed size, but beyond 10 rum the increased survival did not offset the cost of larger seed. Growth and survival of 8-24 mm seed decreased with increasing density, but regressions were nonsignificant (P = 0.06-0.36) because of variability among reefs. Densities as high as 300 m(-2) gave good growth and survival (>40%) over 3 mo. on some reefs. Five natural sites were seeded with 2,600-20,000 juveniles (mean 10-11 mm SL, range 6-19 mm) at an average density of 50 m(-2) to estimate long-term survival from commercial reseeding. After 17-20 mo, when recovered abalone averaged 47-60 mm SL, survival varied widely among the five sites ranging from 1.7% to 25.1 % (average 13.8%). Estimated survival to harvest size of 125 mm SL ranged from 1.3% to 18.6% (average 10.2%) assuming 3 further years of mortality at M = 0.1. The two sites with the lowest survival were affected by substrate movement during storms, highlighting the risk of using exposed locations with boulders small enough to be turned for surveys. Survival to harvest averaged 15.2% across the three sites without significant storm damage. Growth averaged 29.5 mm SL year(-1) across the five sites (range 25-33 mm.year(-1)). A model was used to examine the economic viability of reseeding, assuming that reseeded abalone supplement natural recruits. At a price of NZ$0.32 per 10 mm SL seed, the return on investment was 20% yr(-1) at 10% survival to harvest, and 30% yr(-1) at 15% survival. These returns compare favorably with opportunity costs of similar to 10% yr(-1), suggesting that reseeding is likely to be economically viable if sites and habitat are carefully selected. Large scale seeding should be accompanied by monitoring to quantity net population increase.",10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[697:VOAHIS]2.0.CO;2,,0730-8000,,,SEP,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[697:VOAHIS]2.0.CO;2,

For the stable production of abalone feed, fresh seaweed biomass is required throughout the year. However, currently, the production of farmed Saccharina is limited by environmental conditions such as temperature, irradiance, and nutrient availability between August and November. Due to shortages experienced in supply, the production of early-season biomass can be highly profitable and, therefore, some famers attempt to start their cultivation activities before prevailing, surface seawater temperatures (SST) are optimal. However, attempting to cultivate too early, can lead to total crop failure. Young kelp sporophytes are easily destroyed between 18 and 22 degrees C SST, which can occur during the early nursery period when the materials are confined to tanks. This study investigated the growth of S. japonica thalli and photosynthetic quantum yield (F-v/F-m) under five temperatures (i.e., 18-26 degrees C, at 2 degrees increments) and five irradiances (i.e., 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80mol photons m(-2)s(-1)). This was undertaken for four different size groups of sporophyte thalli (i.e., 0.25, 1, 5, 10mm). There were different responses of the initial groups of S. japonica showing different tolerances to temperature and irradiance. In general, the smaller plants (1mm) were more tolerant of sub-optimal conditions than their larger cohorts. These results indicated the optimum temperature and irradiance ranges for different size groups of S. japonica thalli which, if adopted in management protocols, could contribute to enhanced profitability and a more stable and evenly distributed production of Saccharina raw materials over an entire annual basis.",10.1007/s10811-018-1565-4,,0921-8971,1573-5176,,OCT,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-018-1565-4,
"Chauvaud, P; Day, R; Roussel, S",No evident effect of domestication on the anti-predator behaviour of European abalone (Haliotis tuberculata): Implications for stock enhancement programs,2021,APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,244,,,,105470,"Stock-enhancement programs for the European abalone (Haliotis tuberculata) might be an efficient way to restore collapsed natural populations or preserve fishing activities. Specifically, this practice consists of releasing hatchery-reared juveniles from wild or farmed broodstock into natural environments. However, the process of selection and adaptation to farming conditions may result in domestication, thus leading to genetic and behavioural changes in farmed animals. Therefore, evaluating the effects of the domestication process on ju-veniles is a critical first step toward the development of successful abalone stock-enhancement programs. To this end, the behaviour and survival of sixteen-month-old H. tuberculata juveniles from wild and from farmed broodstock (the product of three generations of shell-length based selection) were compared. We used three assays at different spatial and temporal scales: (1) short-term responses to simulated contact with predators, (2) the activity pattern in the presence of a natural predator (the velvet crab Necora puber) in aquariums during a 2-week trial, and (3) survival in large mesocosms in the presence of predators during a 3-week trial. No significant effects of the broodstock origin of the juveniles were detected on any of the studied parameters (P 0.05). In addition, the estimated size effects were small compared to the overall mean for most of the variables, suggesting that the domestication process was too recent to induce important behavioural changes in juveniles from farmed broodstock. Introducing crabs into the mesocosms significantly decreased abalone survival rates (P < 0.05). In the activity pattern trial, most of the abalone mortality in aquariums with crabs (55%) occurred within the first three days, which was largely attributed to initial exploration of areas outside of shelters by the abalone. In the second week, abalone spent much less time moving when crabs were present (P < 0.05). These results suggest that juveniles from both origins would likely have the same survival rates if released in the wild. The commonly reported high abalone mortality immediately after seeding is likely due to a lack of hiding behaviour or exploration of the new environment during the first few days of exposure to predators in the wild. Therefore, current release systems may need to be adjusted to the ethological characteristics of abalone juveniles to avoid high mortalities due to an initial lack of predator avoidance.",10.1016/j.applanim.2021.105470,"Day, Robert/0000-0001-5913-2292; Roussel, Sabine/0000-0001-9275-0818",0168-1591,1872-9045,,NOV,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2021.105470,

The respiratory cost of development to the six-arm larval stage (day 60) was 14.0 mJ for fed larvae and 8.2 mJ for unfed larvae. We observed three phases of metabolic regulation during development. During embryogenesis (day 0-22), increasing metabolic rates were proportional to increases in cell numbers. During early larval development (day; 22-17), the differences in respiratory rate between fed and unfed larvae were not accounted for by cell number, but by cell-specific metabolic rate (respiratory rate normalized to DNA content). Once an advanced larval stage had been reached (day 47-60), cell-specific respiratory rate and mitochondrial densities (citrate synthase activity normalized to DNA content) were more equivalent between fed and unfed larvae, suggesting that size-specific metabolic rates were determined at a level of physiological regulation that was independent of cell numbers or feeding history.",,,0022-0949,,,AUG,,10393819

Abalone aquaculture has experienced such losses, and thus, thermal-tolerant species are needed for mechanistic research and selective breeding programs. Hence, suitable methods to evaluate the thermal tolerance of abalone have become vitally important. In this study, a high-throughput evaluation method (heat adhesion duration, HAD) was developed based on the adhesion capacity of abalone. The stability and accuracy of the new method were verified by comparisons of survival time, Arrhenius breakpoint temperatures (ABT) of cardiac performance, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Positive correlations were found between HAD and survival time and between HAD and ABT, indicating that individuals with higher HAD were more thermal tolerant. The HAD values increased with acclimation temperature (20 degrees C, 24 degrees C) but were not affected by abalone size, age, or sex. The assessments of HAD, ABT, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated stronger thermal tolerance of the southern population (JJ) of Haliotis discus hannai compared to the northern population (DL), suggesting plasticity of abalone in thermal tolerance. In addition, the thermal resistance of five abalone species from two hybridization systems, H. discus hannai (DD), H. gigantea (GG), H. fulgens (FF), hybrid H. gigantea female x H. discus hannai male (GD), and hybrid H. discus hannai female x H. fulgens male (DF), was evaluated by HAD and ABT, confirming the existence of heterosis for thermal tolerance.

In the present study, two tetraspanins, CD63 and tetraspanin 33 (TSPAN33) from disk abalone (AbCD63 and AbTSPAN33), were identified and characterized at the molecular level. The coding sequences for AbCD63 and AbTSPAN33 encoded polypeptides of 234 and 290 amino acids (aa) with predicted molecular mass of 25.3 and 32.5 kDa, respectively. The deduced AbCD63 and AbTSPAN33 protein sequences were also predicted to have a typical tetraspanin domain architecture, including four transmembrane domains (TM), short N- and C- terminal regions, a short intracellular loop, as well as a large and small extracellular loop. A characteristic CCG motif and cysteine residues, which are highly conserved across CD63 and TSPAN33 proteins of different species, were present in the large extracellular loop of both abalone tetraspanins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the AbCD63 and AbTSPAN33 clustered in the invertebrate subclade of tetraspanins, thus exhibiting a close relationship with tetraspanins of other mollusks. The AbCD63 and AbTSPAN33 mRNA transcripts were detected at early embryonic development stages of disk abalone with significantly higher amounts at the trochophore stage, suggesting the involvement of these proteins in embryonic development. Both AbCD63 and AbTSPAN33 were ubiquitously expressed in all the tissues of unchallenged abalones analyzed, with the highest expression levels found in hemocytes. Moreover, significant induction of AbCD63 and AbTSPAN33 mRNA expression was observed in immunologically important tissues, such as hemocytes and gills, upon stimulation with live bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes), virus (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus), and two potent immune stimulators [polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)]. Collectively, these findings suggest that AbCD63 and AbTSPAN33 are involved in innate immune responses in disk abalone during pathogenic stress. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abalone were assayed using HPLC-FLD methodology based on AOAC official method 2005.06. An uncommon congener, deoxydecarbamoyl-STX (doSTX), was observed in addition to regulated PSTs as unassigned chromatographic peaks. A quantitative reference material was prepared from contaminated Tasmanian abalone viscera and ampouled at 54.2 mu mol/L.

Crabs consumed more juvenile mussels and abalone than seaweed (Ulva lactuca) and fed preferentially on the smallest mussels (6- to 10-mm size class). Further experiments showed that predation on mussels by P. crassipes was highly size dependent, with the largest crabs consuming over twenty-five 15-mm mussels per day.

During industrial processing, the viscera, which are abundant of cellulase, are usually discarded or processed into low-value feedstuff. Thus, it is of interest to obtain cellulase fromabalone viscera and investigate its application for preparation of functional oligosaccharides. RESULTS: A cellulase was purified from the hepatopancreas of abalone by ammonium sulfate precipitation and two-steps column chromatography. The molecular weight of the cellulase was 45 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Peptidemass fingerprinting analysis yielded 103 amino acid residues, which were identical to cellulases from other species of abalone. Substrate specificity analysis indicated that the cellulase is an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase. Hydrolysis of seaweed Porphyra haitanensis polysaccharides by the enzyme produced oligosaccharides with degree of polymerisation of two to four, whose monosaccharide composition was 58% galactose, 4% glucose and 38% xylose. The oligosaccharides revealed 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical as well as hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity.

Bacterial communities were assessed using a culture-based approach and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the V3-V4 16S rDNA region. It was observed that Ulva has the potential to reduce the bacterial load of abalone effluent, with the total number of potential culturable Vibrio species declining from 150x10(3) cells mL(-1) in the inlet to 37x10(3) cells mL(-1) in the outlet of the Ulva system. The NGS dataset supported these findings, with a reduction observed in Vibrio and Pseudoalteromonas from the inlet to outlet samples. A lower number of genera (p < 0.05) were observed on Ulva when compared with water samples, indicating that Ulva has a beneficial, modulatory effect on bacteria. These findings contribute towards the growing body of evidence for the benefits of seaweeds in IMTA and addresses the biosecurity concerns of abalone farmers wishing to improve the circularity of their farming activities by incorporating seaweeds.",10.1007/s10811-024-03298-8,"Bolton, John/0000-0003-0589-9564; Macey, Brett/0000-0002-9995-0238; Cyrus, Mark/0000-0001-5487-6794",0921-8971,1573-5176,,OCT,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-024-03298-8,

This study investigated, for the first time, the effects of different water temperatures (15, 20, and 25 C-degrees) and pH levels (7.5 and 8.1) on oxidative stress and apoptosis in disk abalone by estimating levels of H2O2, malondialdehyde (MDA), dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and the apoptosis-related gene caspase-3. We also visually confirmed apoptotic effects of different water temperatures and pH levels via in situ hybridization and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assays. The levels of H2O2, MDA, SOD, CAT, and caspase-3 increased under low/high water temperature and/or low pH conditions. Expression of the genes was high under high temperature and low pH conditions. Additionally, the apoptotic rate was high under high temperatures and low pH conditions. These results indicate that changes in water temperature and pH conditions individually and in combination trigger oxidative stress in abalone, which can induce cell death.

The main metabolic changes after Roundup (R) exposure were related to disturbance in energy metabolism and metabolic biomarkers such as alanine, succinate, acetate and propionate, suggesting the occcurence of anaerobiosis and the impairment of oxydative metabolism. Results showed also that peak intensities of amino acids used as biomarker of anaerobiosis in molluscs are time and dose dependent. In the opposite, phosphoarginine and ATP level are dependent to Roundup (R) concentration rather than to the time of exposure. We suggest that changes in energy demands require adjustements in the forward arginine kinase reaction rate. Therefore, the results demonstrate the high applicability of HRMAS NMR to elucidate the mechanism of toxicity of Roundup (R).

We investigated the relationship between abalone resources and quantitative or qualitative changes of algal beds in coastal waters around the Ojika Islands, Nagasaki Prefecture, southwestern Japan, from 1988 to 2011. During this period, the catch record of 2 abalone species-Haliotis discus discus and Haliotis gigantea-was examined, and the composition and abundance of macroalgae around the Ojika Islands was observed. The annual landing of abalone has decreased steadily from 91 mt in 1987 to 0.4 mt in 2011. The proportion of H. discus discus to the annual abalone landing has also changed; it was stable (30% 60%) between 1988 and 2000, less than 20% from 2004 to 2005, and increased from 2006, reaching more than 90% in 2010. The macroalgal beds have also changed during this period. The perennial Laminariales beds, consisting of Eisenia bicyclis and Ecklonia spp., had disappeared by 2003, shifting mostly to Sargassaceae (Sargassum macrocarpum) beds. After the Sargassaceae beds had disappeared by 2009, there have been no Laminariales or Sargassaceae beds except for spring algal beds (unusual perennial Sargassaceae beds that form dense stands from March to July and lose most thalli after maturing in August) in some fishing ports. The results suggest a differential detrimental effect of the disappearance of macroalgal beds on abalone, with different species having different effects. After 2009, when no perennial Laminariales or Sargassaceae beds were present, there were no mature individuals of H. gigantea, with no recruitment at the juvenile stage of the latter at major fishing grounds. Reformation of the macroalgal beds is indispensable to sustain or restore the H. gigantea population. On the other hand, because most H. discus discus are able to mature, they can sustain a viable population under this condition.",10.2983/035.032.0110,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,APR,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.032.0110,

This study aimed to assess the role of sand as a substrate and/or dietary component in the intensive tank culture of sandfish in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) in South Africa. A control experiment was conducted to confirm the reported positive effect of sand as a substrate on sandfish growth and a sand-in-diet experiment was conducted to determine if the incorporation of sand into formulated diets could improve sandfish growth in bare tanks. In the control experiment, the mean growth rate of juvenile sandfish in the bare tanks was significantly lower than that of the juveniles reared in tanks with a sand substrate (-0.12 +/- 0.16 g day(-1) SE and 0.03 +/- 0.01 g day(-1) respectively; F-(1,F-2)=1.91, p<0.001). However in the sand-in-diet experiment, the mean growth rate of juvenile sandfish in bare tanks, fed a formulated diet containing 20% sand was not significantly different to juveniles fed a standard formulated diet (-0.13 +/- 0.01 and -0.12 +/- 0.16 g day(-1) respectively; F-(1,F-2)=1.26, p>0.05). Results confirmed the reported positive effect on sandfish growth when sand is provided as a substrate, however sand in diets did not promote growth in the same way, indicating that the inclusion of sand in formulated diets is unlikely to compensate for the lack of sand as a substrate. Future research should therefore aim to identify the optimum parameters of sand substrate and develop tank holding systems capable of maintaining favourable substrate conditions for intensive sandfish culture.

The study evaluated the difference of the thermal tolerance between the high-temperature resistant strain (HR) and general group (GG) by using Arrhenius break temperatures (ABT). The ABT between them showed a significant difference that suggested different levels of thermal resistance. The result was consistent with assessments of upper thermal tolerance, as well as the activity of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. Meanwhile, the key genes regulating cardiac performance were analyzed in molecular level. Quantitative real-time PCR results demonstrated that the RNA expression of beta-ARs in the heart at increasing temperature followed an upward trend. However, the expression of mmp2, timp2, fosa, and pcna genes in the heart decreased. Additionally, western blot results demonstrated that the levels of beta 1-AR and beta 3-AR protein expression steadily increased. Overall, in response to acute thermal stress, the primary effector genes in the beta-AR signalling pathway were beta-ARs. Our study identified an effective and accurate measurement for evaluating the turbot's thermal tolerance and initially explored the molecular mechanisms that regulate cardiac performance under thermal stress.

It is suspected that supplementation of wild populations with hatchery-reared abalone will be necessary for the recovery of this species. This study examines the magnitude, timing, and causes of post-outplanting mortality of hatchery-reared late-juvenile northern abalone. Abalone survivorship declined precipitously following outplanting, with 83% of abalone surviving 24 h after release and only 34% surviving 2 weeks in the wild. Handling, tagging, and temperature variations experienced during the outplanting procedure did not cause mortality. The majority of the abalone mortality in this study was attributable to predators. Additional factors accounted for only 12% mortality over 7 d. A 1-week acclimatization period within predator exclosures did not improve subsequent survival of outplants. These results demonstrate that the ouplanting of hatchery-reared abalone as a method of restoring wild populations of this endangered species is primarily constrained by high mortality during the first few days after outplanting, and that almost all of this early mortality is caused by predation. Predation mortality will therefore have to be overcome if outplanting of hatchery-reared juvenile abalone is to be an effective restoration strategy.Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",10.1002/aqc.2315,,1052-7613,,,APR,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.2315,

The recapture of batch-tagged and released larvae from natural reefs after 533 days at liberty also confirmed the persistence of this tag. A reliable and cost-effective method for batch-tagging juveniles was achieved with the use of an artificial diet that resulted in a distinctive blue-green coloration of the shell. This coloration differentiated released juveniles from wild conspecifies, was easily observed with the naked eye, and persisted on the spire of individuals for 777 days at liberty.

While existing studies have primarily explored abalone behavior in relation to environmental changes, there remains a significant amount to be discovered regarding their behavioral patterns. There are studies in which recordings of readings have been made (indirect methods) of the heart rate of the abalone since it is believed that it is one of the parameters affected due to the changes in temperature and dissolved oxygen in its environment. The main disadvantage of some procedures to measure heart rate in abalone is that an incision is made near the heart, through this incision the measurement is made using the photoplethysmography technique. Another parameter that is affected by these changes (temperature and hypoxia) is respiratory rate. Temperature is an important factor that can reduce oxygen solubility and thus alter abalone respiration; so in this work, we propose to use the technique of photoplethysmography: a method involving the measurement of changes in volume within a biological organ, which offers a unique opportunity to monitor these changes. We adapt this technique to measure gill movements in abalone, a critical indicator of respiratory activity in these marine mollusks. By utilizing a pulse oximetry setup and synchronous detection, we establish an innovative approach to gill movement analysis. This approach employs a pulse train and synchronous demodulation technique, the train of pulses is guided through an optical fiber to one of the respiratory orifices of the abalone to effectively detect and analyze the gill movements of abalone. Additionally, the role of frequency of its gill movements is highlighted as another critical variable of interest within the broader study of Haliotis fulgens, shedding light on the multifaceted nature of abalone behavior and responses to their surroundings.

Many aspects of such polyculture systems have been described, but little attention has been given to the impact of live seaweeds on the microbiological properties of the water that connects the algae and animals. In this investigation, the Pacific red alga Gracilaria textorii was cultured in a recirculated dual tank system (150 L) with the juvenile abalone Haliotis discus hannai. Dynamic changes of total bacteria (TB) and total Vibrio (TV) in the water of polyculture and monoculture systems were evaluated. Results revealed that (1) level of TB in the polyculture was constantly higher than in the monoculture over a 6.5-day period. While levels of TV in the polyculture was detected to be constantly lower than in the monoculture, (2) integration of G. textorii in the abalone culture changed the Vibrio compositions in the water as judged by the changes of bacteria colony types; (3) application of artificial diet led to dramatic increase of the levels in TB and TV in both systems at 12 h after application in the 24-h test and resulted in selective propagation of Vibrio in the water in the monoculture system; (4) polyculture of G. textorii with juvenile abalone in combination with feeding with live algal diet helped to maintain low levels of TV and the balance of the Vibrio composition; (5) living biomass of G. textorii was effective in preventing propagation of two purified Vibrio strains (V alginolaticus and V logei) in the water. These results provide a general basis of the dynamic changes of levels in TB and TV in a seaweed-abalone polyculture system with or without artificial diet in tanks.

It is induced by the type I interferon system (IFN alpha/beta) in various vertebrates, but its expression has not been identified or characterized in mollusks or other multi-cellular invertebrates to date. In this study, we isolated the Mx gene from a disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) normalized cDNA library. Mx cDNA was sequenced, cloned and compared to other known Mx proteins. The full-length 1664 bp of abalone Mx cDNA contained a 1533-bp open reading frame that codes for 511 amino acids. Within the coding sequence of abalone Mx, characteristic features were found, such as a tripartite guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding motif and a dynamin family signature. In addition, leucine residues in the C-terminal region displayed a special leucine domain at L-468, L-475, L-489 and L-510, suggesting that abalone Mx may have a similar oligomerization function as other leucine zipper motifs. Abalone Mx protein exhibited 44% amino acid similarity with channel catfish Mx1, rainbow trout Mx2 and Atlantic halibut Mx. Abalones were injected intramuscularly with the known IFN inducer poly I:C and RT-PCR was performed for Mx mRNA analysis. The results showed enhanced Mx expression in abalone gill and digestive tissues 24 h as well as 48 h after injection of poly I:C. Mx mRNA was expressed in gill, digestive gland, mantle and foot tissues in healthy abalone, suggesting that the basal level of Mx expressed is tissue-specific. There is no known Mx protein closely related to abalone Mx according to phylogenetic analysis. Abalone Mx may have diverged from a common gene ancestor of fish and mammalian Mx proteins, since abalone Mx showed high similarity in terms of conserved tripartite GTP-binding, dynamin family signature motifs and poly I:C enhancement of Mx mRNA expression.

Sample Population-Cartilage tissue from 12 pigs. Procedures-Articular cartilage explants were conditioned with a simulated digest of BO (BOsim) or DN (DNsim) at concentrations of 0, 0.06, or 0.18 mg/mL or indomethacin ONDOsim; 0 or 0.02 mg/mL) for 72 hours. Control explants received digest vehicle only. Explants were or were not stimulated with recombinant human-IL-1 beta (10 or 0 ng/mL) during the final 48 hours of culture. Concentrations of PGE(2), GAG and NO in media samples (mPGE(2), mGAG, and mNO concentrations, respectively) were analyzed, and explant tissue was stained fluorochromatically to determine chondrocyte viability. Treatment effects during the final 48-hour culture period were analyzed. Results-IL-1 increased mPGE(2), mGAG, and mNO concentrations in control explants with-out adversely affecting cell viability. Treatment with INDOsim blocked PGE(2) production and increased mNO concentration in IL-1-stimulated and unstimulated explants and increased mGAG concentration in unstimulated explants. Treatment with DNsim (0.06 and 0.18 mg/mL) reduced mPGE(2) concentration in IL-1-stimulated and unstimulated explants, reduced mNO,2 concentration in IL-1-stimulated explants, and increased mNO concentration in unstimulated explants. Treatment with 0.18 mg of DNsim/mL increased cell viability in the presence of IL-1. In IL-1-stimulated explants, BOsim (0.06 and 0.18 mg/mL) reduced mPGE(2) concentration, but 0.18 mg of BOsim/mL increased cell viability.

In the present study, the physicochemical characteristics and effects of Spirulina on ARPE-19 and HaCaT cells were monitored after mass-production, compared with conventional product. Gene ontology (GO) was analyzed using systems biology network that accounted for the function of Spirulina in human health. Spirulina powder had a smooth surface with adsorbing particles and contained sodium, magnesium, and potassium. Spirulina powder extracts in 0.1 x PBS, 0.1 M HEPES, 0.1 M NaCl, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and acetonitrile showed broad absorbance peaks at 300-450 and 500-700 nm. In ARPE-19 and HaCaT cells, Spirulina powder in PBS displayed proliferation at 2-20 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL, respectively. Cell viability levels of HaCaT cells were almost higher than 90% at 0.1-20 mg/mL. Despite cell susceptibility, phycocyanin, which is a component of Spirulina, helped maintain consistency of cell responses with Spirulina. Spirulina functions were explained by GO-terms, mainly binding, cellular process, and cell in the network, in terms of anti-oxidant activity. Mass-produced Spirulina powder can be developed as a high-value nutraceutical for therapeutic applications in clinics. This protocol can be extended to other materials for biomedical applications.

Surveys on the southeast coast of Australia show a negative relationship between densities of C. rodgersii and H. rubra at several spatial scales, suggesting negative interactions. In intact algal beds, we used enclosures to estimate the effects and relative magnitude of intra- and interspecific competition on the body condition, gonad development and survival of C. rodgersii and H. rubra. An increased density of conspecifics led to declines in the dry gonad weight of C. rodgersii and in the dry foot and stomach content weights of H. rubra. The effects of interspecific competition were asymmetrical. Manipulations of H. rubra densities had no detectable effect on C. rodgersii. In contrast, in enclosures with added C. rodgersii, H. rubra showed reduced total and dry weights of stomach contents and increased mortality relative to controls without urchins. The effects of C. rodgersii on H. rubra could be linked to differences in feeding habits and morphology. C. rodgersii is a generalist herbivore, which, even at low densities, reduced the cover and standing biomass of total, brown and red algae relative to controls without urchins. In contrast, H. rubra is a specialist herbivore, which, even at high densities, had little effect on the cover and standing biomass of algae relative to the effect of C. rodgersii. This study suggests that the invader C. rodgersii is the superior competitor in interactions with H. rubra, and that its presence, even at low densities, affects the abalone fishery.",10.3354/meps07816,"Strain, Elisabeth/0000-0003-2165-9544; Johnson, Craig/0000-0002-9511-905X",0171-8630,1616-1599,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps07816,

Land-based cultivation has the advantage of customization of high-quality biomass production. However, the high material and preparation costs of traditionally used enrichment media are a limitation of land-based cultivation of D. mollis and P. hecatensis. This study explores ways to reduce operational and management costs associated with controlling the culturing conditions of D. mollis and P. hecatensis without compromising biomass growth and quality in land-based tank cultivation systems. Five experimental treatments, 1) ambient seawater (AS); 2) von Stosch enrichment medium (VSE); 3) Guillard's f/2 medium (f/2); 4) commercial fertilizer, Jack's Special (JS); 5) JS with vitamin (JSV), were used in the present study. Growth rates, pigment, and protein content of D. mollis and P. hecatensis were measured. D. mollis showed faster growth rates than P. hecatensis, indicating that the former is more economically suitable for land-based cultivation based on this parameter alone. Growth and protein content of D. mollis exposed to VSE decreased due to insufficient nitrogen in the tissue. However, the protein content of D. mollis exposed to JS and JSV significantly increased without a decrease in growth. Palmaria hecatensis showed similar growth, pigment, and protein content regardless of the treatment, except in AS. Therefore, the commercial fertilizer, Jack's Special (25-5-15), can replace the VSE for D. mollis and P. hecatensis, reducing operational and management costs linked to nutrient supplementation.",10.1007/s10811-025-03480-6,,0921-8971,1573-5176,,2025 MAR 29,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-025-03480-6,

However, the effects of red LED irradiation and melatonin injection on the antioxidant capacity and degree of apoptosis in abalones, which are nocturnal organisms, have not yet been reported. In this study, we compared the expression levels of antioxidant enzymes, total antioxidant capacity, and the degree of apoptosis in abalones subjected to red LED irradiation and melatonin treatment. The results revealed that at high water temperatures (25 degrees C), the mRNA expression levels of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) genes and the antioxidant activity of SOD decreased in abalones in the red-LED irradiated and melatonin-treated groups compared with those in abalones in the control group. Although high water temperatures induced DNA damage in the abalone samples, the degree of apoptosis was lower in the red-LED irradiated and melatonin-treated groups than in the control group. Overall, the abalones in the melatonin-treated and redLED irradiated groups showed reduced oxidative stress and increased antioxidant enzyme levels under thermal stress compared with those in the control group.

Of the seven Haliotis species in California, white abalone is considered to have the highest extinction risk and was the first marine invertebrate listed as an endangered species under the Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA). Lifespan was previously estimated from observations of early growth; however, no study has generated ages for the largest white abalone. To address questions of age and growth, bomb radiocarbon (C-14) dating was used on shells from large white abalone. Measured bomb C-14 levels were compared to regional C-14 reference records to provide estimates of age, growth and lifespan. Bomb radiocarbon dating indicated that growth was variable among individuals, with a maximum estimated age of 27 years. The findings presented here provide support for previous age and growth estimates and an estimated lifespan near 30 years.

Four experiments were conducted, three at 25 degrees C and one at 20 degrees C, typically with 10-13 larvae per replicate and five replicates per treatment. Each assay lasted 48 h. Larvae typically became responsive to IBMX at least 24 h before they became responsive to adult homogenate and were always slowest to become responsive to excess K+, suggesting that IBMX acts downstream from the sites at which the other cues operate and that the upstream sites become operational later in development. Competent larvae also responded far more quickly to IBMX - usually within 6-8 h - than to the other cues. Excess K+ and cues associated with adult homogenate may take longer (24-48 h) to penetrate to their sites of action. Alternatively, IBMX may stimulate metamorphosis directly, possibly by increasing intracellular concentrations of cAMP, cGMP, or Ca2+, while the other tested substances may act instead to turn off production of an inhibitory factor, which must then degrade before metamorphosis can occur. In three additional experiments, competent larvae remained responsive to all three inducers during 3-4 days of starvation, indicating that the metamorphic pathway of H. elegans, once developed, is not readily degraded even under severe nutritional stress.

Its full-length cDNA sequence was 2062 bp, with a 1548 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 516 aa. The molecular mass of the deduced protein was approximately 57.8 kDa with an estimated pI of 5.23, and showed highest identity (47%) to acorn worm Saccoglossus kowalevskii. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed saIRAK-4 shares conserved signature motifs with other IRAK-4 proteins, including the death domain (DD), serine/threonine/tyrosine protein kinase domain (STYKc), protein kinases ATP-binding region signature, serine/threonine protein kinases active-site signature and prokaryotic membrane lipoprotein lipid attachment site. Quantitative real-time PCR was employed to investigate the tissue distribution of saIRAK-4 mRNA, and its expression in abalone under bacteria challenge and larvae at different developmental stages. The 5aIRAK-4 mRNA could be detected in all examined tissues, with the highest expression level in gills, and was up-regulated in hemocytes and gills after bacteria injection. Additionally, 5aIRAK-4 was constitutively expressed at all examined developmental stages.

In this study, we investigated the presence of pheromonelike substances from the hypobranchial gland of the abalone Haliotis asinina using bioassays, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The hypobranchial eland of many prosobranchial marine molluscs has been classified as a sex auxiliary gland releasing unknown substances during spawning.

This study of growth of greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata , Leach) over a prolonged period (3 years) indicates that both data treatments are suitable. If weights are being used, then a growth model that allows for exponential growth, such as specific growth rate (SGR), must be used. If lengths are measured, then the calculation of simple differences in the lengths over time is sufficient. The apparent paradox in use of two forms of measure is comfortably rationalized as a result of the weight-length relationship and the von Bertalanffy relationship for this species. Thus, methods of minimal disturbance and stress, such as photographic estimation of length, could be used to accurately monitor growth trends in aquacultural studies as well as in industry.",10.1046/j.1365-2109.2003.00814.x,"Reaburn, Robyn/0000-0002-4235-7732",1355-557X,,,FEB,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.2003.00814.x,
"Tegner, MJ; Haaker, PL; Riser, KL; Vilchis, LI","Climate variability, kelp forests, and the Southern California red abalone fishery",2001,JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH,20,2,755,763,,"Declines in landings of Southern California abalone fisheries and the eventual collapse of many stocks over the last two decades coincided with a period of greatly increased environmental variability. This included massive storms, an increase in the frequency of warm-water El Nino events after 1976, and an interdecadal-scale increase in sea surface temperatures. Kelp populations may be decimated by severe storms or warm water. Because of the strong inverse relationship between nitrate availability and water temperature, temperature is a good indicator of nitrate availability or stress SINCE kelp growth ceases in warm nutrient-depleted water, tissue decays, and standing stocks may be greatly reduced. Abalones are affected by the availability of the drift kelp on which they feed. Anomalously warm temperatures may affect reproduction, and altered current patterns may affect larval dispersal. Because water temperature varies with location in Southern California and each of the five exploited abalone species has its own thermal preferences, we chose to evaluate the role of environmental variability on population, of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) on three northern Channel Islands spanning a temperature gradient. We compared water temperature regimes and anomalies, monthly aerial surveys of canopies of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), and field evidence of poor abalone growth and reproduction during El Nino events. The severity of El Nino disturbances and long-term changes in kelp standing stocks both correlated with the temperature gradient. Declines of red abalone total landings and area-specific landings on the warmer Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Island began a decade after the large 1957-1959 El Nino. The subsequent collapse of many populations appears related to warm anomalies after the 1976-1977 regime shift, kelp declines, and poor reproduction coupled with fishing-induced declines in adult abalone density. Red abalone populations have persisted on cooler San Miguel Island where thermal anomalies had less effect and kelp canopy biomass has been more stable. Southern California abalones evolved in this disturbance regime, but the combination of extended periods of increased environmental variability with intense fishing pressure may have led to the loss of local populations, especially in warmer areas.",,,0730-8000,,,DEC,,

In the abalone farming sector, many factors are known to influence abalone activity, but little is known about how shelter limitations affect behaviour. In this study, we investigated the behavioural responses of juvenile and adult ab-alones to shelter limitations and the relationship between abalone size and activity level. Cohorts of 139 adult and 272 juvenile Pacific abalones (Haliotis discus hannai) of farm origin were observed under laboratory con-ditions during a 2-week period with a high level of shelter availability and a 2-week period with limited shelter. We recorded the locomotion under the shelters in the daytime, their positions in aggregations just before the forage time window, and the number of foraging nights. Our data analyses confirmed that in conditions of shelter limitation, juveniles showed increased forage frequency variation, and both active and inactive showed juveniles decreased activity levels. In contrast, adults showed decreased forage frequency variation, and while active adults showed decreased activity levels, inactive adults showed increased activity levels. We found that shelter limitations decreased the forage frequency of juveniles by affecting their forage motivation, not by restricting their access to forage.The results improve our understanding of the differences in Pacific abalone behaviours at the juvenile and adult stages and provide us with valuable information for the future design of abalone culture tanks and cages.",10.1016/j.applanim.2023.105941,,0168-1591,1872-9045,,JUL,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2023.105941,

Under a natural photon flux density (PFD) of 39-52 mol photons m(-2) day(-1) an aerial stocking density of 3-4 kg m-2 provided highest yields. Specific growth rates of P mollis were highly correlated with specific light densities (SLD) over a range from 0.0048 to 0.036 mol photons g[fresh wt.] day-1 and no light saturation was evident at a culture temperature of 16 + 1 degreesC. Growth of P mollis was highest at a salinity of 30 +/- 1parts per thousand, whether municipal tap water or brackish well water was used for diluting seawater. Optimal temperature for growth was 12 degreesC at low light intensities (SLD=0.010 mol photons g(-1) day(-1)) and 14-18 degreesC at high light intensities (SLD=0.021 mol photons g(-1) day(-1)). Growth at higher temperatures was positively correlated with increasing light.

Dissolved signal molecules that cause sperm to orient and accelerate towards an egg could play pivotal roles in fertilization success, but such compounds are largely undescribed. This investigation considered the behavioral responses of red abalone (Haliotis rafescens) sperm to soluble factors released into sea water by conspecific eggs. Sperm in proximity to individual live eggs swam significantly faster and oriented towards the egg surface. Bioassay-guided fractionation was employed to isolate the chemoattractant, yielding a single pure, fully active compound after reversed-phase and size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography. Chemical characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated that the free amino acid L-tryptophan was the natural sperm attractant in H. rafescens. Eggs released L-tryptophan at concentrations that triggered both activation and chemotaxis in sperm, exhibiting significant activity at levels as low as 10(-8) mol l(-1). The D-isomer of tryptophan was inactive, showing that the sperm response was stereospecific. Serotonin, a potent neuromodulator and tryptophan metabolite, had no effect on sperm swim speeds or on orientation. In experimental treatments involving an elevated, uniform concentration of tryptophan (10(-7) mol l(-1)) or the addition of tryptophanase, an enzyme that selectively digests tryptophan, sperm failed to navigate towards live eggs.

"Farías, WJ; Winkler, FM; Brokordt, KB","Genotype by environment interactions, heritabilities and genetic correlations for productive traits of Haliotis rufescens",2017,AQUACULTURE,473,,407,416,,"A critical aspect of a selective breeding program is whether responses of traits of interest are similar in different environments. The magnitude of the genotype by environment interaction (GEI) together with heritability (h(2)) accounts for this aspect. Despite the economic significance of abalones and the interest in genetic improvement programs for their cultivation, only one previous study has reported GEI estimations for this group of mollusks. The objective of the present study was to estimate h(2) and the existence of GEI for growth traits of Haliotis rufescens cultivated in Chilean farms with different environmental and management conditions. A total of 2 cohorts (2007 and 2009) of 50 and 42 families of full sibs (FS), respectively, were used. Replicates of each FS family of the 2007 cohort were distributed in two farms in the northern region of the country and were evaluated after 1 and 2 years of cultivation. For the 2009 cohort, replicates of each family were distributed in a farm in the northern region and a farm in the southern region of the country. The estimated h(2) values were significant for all traits, with the length and width of the shell and total weight varying primarily by cohort between 0.22-0.62, 0.16-0.58 and 0.40-0.53, respectively. The genetic correlations (r(G)) between traits were all higher than 0.82. The expected correlated responses for improving the total weight using the shell length as a selection criterion predict a selection gain (14-51%) similar to what would be obtained by selecting directly for weight (16-51%) in all environments examined. Thus, indirect selection by shell length and the direct use of total weight as a selection criterion would yield similar effects in terms of the increase in weight. High r(G), not significantly different from 1, were observed for the analyzed traits between replicates of the families in any of the farms compared, both within the northern region and between the northern and southern regions of the country. These high r(G) were indicative of non-significant GEI for the analyzed traits. Therefore, results suggest that one selective breeding program could provide improved red abalone for the industry in Chile with consistent results between farms located in different environments. Statement of relevance: Abalones are one of the most important mollusks in aquaculture due to their commercial value in international markets, especially in Asia; as such there are several efforts to develop abalone breeding programs in different countries. In this work we addressed a critical aspect for a selective breeding program, which is to know whether responses of productive traits are similar in different environments. Considering that the magnitude of the genotype by environment interaction (GEI) together with heritability (h(2)) accounts for this aspect, we estimated these genetic quantitative parameters for growth traits (total mass, shell length and width) in two cohorts of the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, cultivated throughout Chile. Results indicated that the application of selection by the shell length at age of harvest has the greatest potential for improving the production of H. rufescens. These improvements are practical (ease and accuracy in measurement), have indirect effects on the objective trait of selection (weight), and consist of a trait that is not significantly affected by genotype-environment interactions. In addition, the results obtained suggest that a single selective breeding program would be sufficient for the red abalone industry in Chile, as the response to selection of traits associated with growth would be similar in different environments. Red abalone is naturally distributed in California and Baja California coasts, and this information can be especially useful in planning breeding programs also in the west coast of USA and Mexico.

Various research and academic institutions in Southeast Asia such as the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center Aquaculture Department (SEAFDEC AQD) are carrying out research on commercially important marine species including 10 fish, 6 crustacean, and 7 mollusk species. Since fry availability is a major constraint in the development of culture systems, a major research thrust of SEAFDEC AQD is the development of commercially viable technologies for breeding and seed production of commercially important marine fish and crustaceans such as milkfish, groupers, snappers and mud crabs, in addition to the production of fry and juveniles of endangered and depleted species such as the sea horse and the tropical abalone for stock enhancement and sea ranching. Although hatchery production of milkfish and sea bass are now commercially viable enterprises, research is being pursued to improve fry quality through feed supplementation and to lower production cost by using alternative live or artificial feeds. Larviculture techniques are being developed for technically demanding species such as groupers and snappers. The recent success in larviculture of the mud crab Scylla serrata is expected to stimulate the growth of the mud crab industry in the region. Similarly, encouraging developments in the breeding and larviculture of the sea horse and mollusks such as the tropical abalone will provide the necessary support to carry out future stock enhancement and sea ranching programs for these species.

Forty-eight previously frozen stomachs from wild abalone adults were thawed and individually homogenized. Four cultured abalone adults maintained under a balanced diet containing cellulose were killed and the fresh stomach samples processed. Cellulase activity was estimated through the production of glucose, incubating the homogenate from each organism with cellulose. To determine the effect of bacteria, each stomach was incubated (at 25 degreesC for 20 h) in a completely randomized design, with and without an antibiotic mixture. For a time series measurement (exp. 2), four homogenates from wild abalone were used; the incubation mixture was followed up taking samples at 0, 1, 2,4, 8, 16, 20, 32, 64 and 72 h. The latter samples were also used to measure the enzymatic activity before and after a 72-h incubation, in the absence of antibiotics (exp. 3). Initial bacterial counts in the wild abalone homogenates were 459 colonies per mL. In the presence of the antibiotic mixture, no bacterial growth was observed. Initial cellulase activity was 1.6 Units. Cellulose degradation figures were low, even in the absence of antibiotics, indicating the low dependence of abalone on the nutrients derived from the digestion of the cell walls. Still, the addition of antibiotics depressed the digestion of cellulose (14.5 vs. 10.2%), suggesting the importance of live bacteria in the digestion process, and that the majority of the degraded cellulose is perhaps acted upon by endogenous enzymes. The time series experiment of samples from wild abalone, with and without antibiotics, showed quadratic effects on cellulose digestion y = 7.55 + .29h - .005 h(2) (r(2) = .2212), but no significant differences between treatments. The gradual increase in the digestion of cellulose, followed by a plateau is similar to what happens in ruminant digestion. The initial and final enzyme activity without antibiotics showed a significant reduction of 41.1% for the wild abalone whereas in cultured abalone a 50.9% significant reduction was observed. It seems that the cellulase complex enzymes present in the homogenates remain active after 72 h of incubation, even though their activity is lowered by about one half. Although the use of antibiotics assure the absence of live bacteria in the incubation mixture, the cellular enzymes possibly freed by the effect of the antibiotics could still be active for up to 72 h after the microbes are no longer viable. Thus the enzymatic activity attributed to the stomach itself could still be confounded.",,"Viana, Maria Teresa/0000-0002-3074-767X",0730-8000,,,JUN,,

Based on PCP toxicity in red abalone (6 h LC50 1.6 mg l(-1); 6 h NOEL = 0.8 mg l(-1)), animals were exposed in flowing seawater (14 degrees C) to a sublethal PCP concentration of 1.2 mg l(-1) and a water salinity of either 25, 35 or 45 parts per thousand. Phosphagen changes in foot muscle were monitored by surface-probe localized P-31 NMR. Upon PCP exposure, phosphoarginine (PA) levels declined and inorganic phosphate (Pi) levels concurrently increased. Dosing was terminated at a standard metabolic endpoint (MEP), defined as the time for the spectral peak height for Pi to reach one-half that of PA. This was on average 3.3 +/- 0.2 and 6.8 +/- 0.7 h at ambient salinity; 5.3 +/- 0.7 and 7.1 +/- 0.7 h for high salinity; and 4.0 +/- 0.5 and 6.5 +/- 1.0 h at low salinity, for red and black abalone, respectively. During recovery, all biochemical endpoints returned to normal; however, both onset and intensity of effects were influenced by changes in seawater salinity. Disposition of [U-C-14]PCP in both species was also examined to determine if the effects observed with NMR had a kinetic basis. Three sets of abalone (n = 3) from each species were exposed to each salinity (25, 35 and 45 parts per thousand), plus 1.2 mg l(-1) of [U-C-14]PCP. Red abalone were exposed for 3.5 h and black abalone for both 3.5 and 6.5 h (they represent the lowest average MEP for both species). Residues were quantified via tissue digestion and liquid scintillation counting. The 3.5 h total concentration factors (TCFs) for red abalone were not significantly different among the three salinities (P > 0.05) and ranged from 104 to 133. However, low salinity seemed to deter the uptake of [U-C-14]PCP in black abalone, as the TCF was over three times lower for abalone exposed to 25 parts per thousand at both 3.5 h (TCF = 19 +/- 11) and 6.5 h (TCF = 38 +/- 8) than at 35 parts per thousand (3.5 h TCF = 62 +/- 6; 6.5 h TCF = 119 +/- 11) and 45 parts per thousand (3.5 h TCF = 67 +/- 14, 6.5 h TCF = 115 +/- 8). Furthermore, the 3.5 h TCF for red abalone exposed to PCP at all salinities was similar to the 6.5 h TCF for black abalone exposed at 35 and 45 parts per thousand. Thus, black abalone appear to have greater resistance to the combined effects of PCP and salinity variations, which appears to be due to slower uptake of the biocide. While PCP is a potent uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, use of varying water salinities simulated an additional stress imposed on intertidal animals by transient or seasonal environmental changes.

However, it has been unclear whether the end product of alginate lyases (i.e. unsaturated monouronate-derived 4-deoxy-L-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronic acid (DEH)) is assimilated by abalone itself, because DEH cannot be metabolized via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway of animals. Under these circumstances, we recently noticed the occurrence of an NADPH-dependent reductase, which reduced DEH to 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate, in hepatopancreas extract of the pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai. In the present study, we characterized this enzyme to some extent. The DEH reductase, named HdRed in the present study, could be purified from the acetone-dried powder of hepatopancreas by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by conventional column chromatographies. HdRed showed a single band of similar to 40 kDa on SDS-PAGE and reduced DEH to 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate with an optimal temperature and pH at around 50 degrees C and 7.0, respectively. HdRed exhibited no appreciable activity toward 28 authentic compounds, including aldehyde, aldose, ketose, alpha-keto-acid, uronic acid, deoxy sugar, sugar alcohol, carboxylic acid, ketone, and ester.

This process, known as ocean acidification, is a potential threat to marine populations via alterations in survival and development. To date, however, little research has examined the effects of ocean acidification on rare or endangered species. To begin to assess the impacts of acidification on endangered northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana) populations, we exposed H. kamtschatkana larvae to various levels of CO2 [400 ppm (ambient), 800 ppm, and 1800 ppm CO2] and measured survival, settlement, shell size, and shell development. larval survival decreased by ca. 40% in elevated CO2 treatments relative to the 400 ppm control. However, CO2 had no effect on the proportion of surviving larvae that metamorphosed at the end of the experiment. Larval shell abnormalities became apparent in approximately 40% of larvae reared at 800 ppm CO2, and almost all larvae reared at 1800 ppm CO2 either developed an abnormal shell or lacked a shell completely. Of the larvae that did not show shell abnormalities, shell size was reduced by 5% at 800 ppm compared to the control. Overall, larval development of H. kamtschatkana was found to be sensitive to ocean acidification. Near future levels of CO2 will likely pose a significant additional threat to this species, which is already endangered with extinction due in part to limited reproductive output and larval recruitment.

However, for only 1 out of 5 independent cultures was a net decrease observed in dry organic weight during the complete period of larval development (5 to 7 days). In fact, there were net increases in dry organic weight from the oocyte (day O) to the newly formed veliger larva (2-day-old). These weight increases during early development could be explained by increases in the amounts of specific biochemical components of the larvae, relative to oocytes. The metabolic rates of larvae were measured (oxygen consumption) and used to compare (i) the required energy for development with (ii) the energy supplied from the catabolism of biochemical reserves. This analysis revealed that the cost of development for larvae could not be explained by the rates of use of the energy stores initially present in the oocyte. Larvae, from two independent cultures, could only supply 25% or 71% of their energy requirements by the use of internal reserves. Larvae of H. rufescens cannot use particulate foods and, thus, this energy resource cannot be invoked. Estimates of the contribution that dissolved organic material in seawater could provide to larvae, showed that this pool of exogenous material could supply the missing energy.

The tropical abalone, Haliotis asinina, in common with many other invertebrates contains a peptide with a similar structure to GnRH. This study looks at its possible involvement in reproduction by injecting groups of one-year-old female abalone at the mature phase by injecting them with synthetic H. asinina (Has) GnRH at doses of 0, 250 and 500 ng/g and then measuring the amount of material in nerve ganglia, ovary and hemolymph that cross-reacted with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for vertebrate LH and steroid, estradiol. Immunohistochemistry, using antibodies for the same two compounds, was also carried out to examine the location of immunoactivity in the tissues of the animals. There were slight (in some cases statistically significant) increases in LH-immunoactivity and estradiol in the hemolymph and tissues. However, this applied to the lower dose only (i.e the dose-response relationship was non-monotonic). Using immunohistochemistry, LH-immunoreactive cells were observed in types 1 and 2 neurosecretory (NS1 and NS2) cells within the cerebral and pleuropedal ganglia of H. asinina. In addition, LH-immunoreactive nerve fiber bundles were strongly detected in both ganglia. The immunoactivity against the estrogen appeared to be localized in the granulated cells within the connective tissue and trabeculae of the mature ovary. There was no positive staining in the cytoplasm of any stage of the germ cells. The interpretation of these findings is presently hindered by the fact that the homologous gene for vertebrate LH has not yet been identified in the genomes of any mollusks (so the cause of the immunostaining is as yet unknown) and also by the fact that mollusks are known to readily absorb steroids from the environment and store them long-term in the form of fatty acid esters.

Extending the larval period of non-feeding larvae strongly affects post-metamorphic survival and growth in a range of species. These 'carry-over' effects are assumed to be due to changes in larval energetic reserves but direct tests are surprisingly rare. Here, we examine the energetic costs ( relative to the costs of metamorphosis) of extending the larval period of the colonial ascidian Diplosoma listerianum. We also manipulated larval activity levels and compared the energy consumption rates of swimming larvae and inactive larvae. Larval swimming was, energetically, very costly relative to either metamorphosis or merely extending the larval period. At least 25% of the larval energetic reserves are available for larval swimming but metamorphosis was relatively inexpensive in this species and larval reserves can be used for post-metamorphic growth. The carry-over effects previously observed in this species appear to be nutritionally mediated and even short (< 3 h) periods of larval swimming can significantly deplete larval energy reserves.",10.1080/10236240400029333,"Marshall, Dustin/0000-0001-6651-6219",1023-6244,1029-0362,,MAR,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10236240400029333,

The goal of this project was to develop a land-based system for the integrated culture of seaweeds and shellfish, to test the ef-ficacy of integrated versus non-integrated designs, and to assess the potential for IMTA to mitigate the effects of climate change from ocean acidification on shellfish growth and physiology. We utilized the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and the red seaweed dulse (Devaleraea mollis) as our study species and designed integrated tanks at three different recirculation rates (0%, 30%, and 65% recirculation per hour) to test how an integrated design would affect growth rates of the abalone and seaweeds, modify nutrient levels, and change water chemistry. We specifically hypothesized that IMTA designs would raise seawater pH to benefit calcifying species. Our results indicated that juvenile abalone grew significantly faster in weight (22% increase) and shell area (11% increase) in 6 months in tanks with the highest recirculation rates (65%). The 65% recirculation treatment also exhibited a significant increase in mean seawater pH (0.2 pH units higher) due to the biological activity of the seaweed in the connected tanks. We found a significant positive relationship between the mean pH of seawater in the tanks and juvenile abalone growth rates across all treatments. There were no significant differences in the growth of dulse among treatments, but dulse growth did vary seasonally. Seawater phosphate and nitrate concentrations were depleted in the highest recirculation rate treatment, but ammonium concentrations were elevated, likely due to the abalone effluent.

Kelp forests are known to be susceptible, and there has been a rise in sea urchin barrens around the world. When temperatures increase so do physiological demands while food resources decline, tightening metabolic constraints. In this case study, we examine red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) looking at sublethal impacts and their prospects for recovery within kelp forests that have shifted to sea urchin barrens. Abalone are a recreationally fished species that once thrived in northern California's bull kelp forests but have recently suffered mass mortalities since the 2014-2016 marine heatwave. Quantitative data exist on the health and reproduction of abalone both prior to and after the collapse. The survivors of the mass mortality show a 2-year lag in body and gonad condition indices. After the lag, body and gonad indexes decreased substantially, as did the relationship between shell length and body weight. Production of mature eggs per female declined by 99% (p < 0.001), and the number of eggs per gram of female body weight (2,984/g) declined to near zero (9/g). The number of males with sperm was reduced by 33%, and the sperm abundance score was reduced by 28% (p = 0.414). We observed that these reductions were for mature eggs and sperm while immature eggs and spermatids were still present in large numbers. In the lab, after reintroduction of kelp, weight gains were quickly lost following a second starvation period. This example illustrates how climate-driven declines in foundation species can suppress recovery of the system by impacting body condition and future reproduction of surviving individuals. Given the poor reproductive potential of the remaining abalone in northern California, coupled with ongoing mortality and low kelp abundances, we discuss the need to maintain the fishing moratorium and implement active abalone restoration measures. For fished species, such as abalone, this additional hurdle to recovery imposed by changes in climate is critical to understand and incorporate into resource management and restoration.",10.3389/fmars.2021.725134,,,2296-7745,,Aug-16,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.725134,

Local restoration efforts have focused on outplanting juvenile abalone, which is costly because of the husbandry required to raise abalone to outplanting size. This study tested if hatchery-produced larval pinto abalone could be successfully outplanted and if postoutplant growth of larval abalone differed from hatchery-raised animals. Wild broodstock were spawned. and some larvae remained at the hatchery for rearing, whereas most were transported to the Shannon Point Marine Center (SPMC) for outplanting. At two sites in the Salish Sea, larvae were outplanted at a density of 13,000 larvae m(-2) into two types of larval abalone modules (LAM): tented LAM (125 mu m Nitex tenting) and open LAM (no tenting). There were also control LAM with no tenting and no abalone. Larvae were also seeded in LAM in aquaria at SPMC to compare field and aquaria survival and to estimate emigration. Shell lengths of field, laboratory. and hatchery-reared abalone were measured to better understand if hatchery life compromises early growth. Four months after outplanting, abundance of settled abalone was significantly greater in tented LAM than open and control LAM. Control LAM contained no abalone, suggesting reproduction by wild abalone did not occur at the field sites. Open LAM had a mean outplant success of 0.1% (0-12 settled abalone) and tented LAM a mean success of 0.4% (16-35 settled abalone). Outplant success was higher in SPMC aquaria. Open and tented LAM had 1.5% and 3.0% success, respectively. Abalone found on aquaria walls outside the LAM accounted for 0.2% of the seeded abalone for both open and tented LAM. Four months after outplanting, shell lengths of field abalone were not significantly different from lengths of hatchery-reared abalone, suggesting hatchery conditions did not compromise growth rates of newly settled abalone. These findings suggest that releasing larval pinto abalone into tented field modules has potential to supplement wild stocks in the Salish Sea as a lower cost alternative to outplanting juveniles.",10.2983/035.039.0220,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,AUG,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.039.0220,

In recent years, Fujian in the southern region of China has become the chief abalone farming center, accounting for 85% of the total Pacific abalone yield. The practice of transferring abalone to northern regions to oversummer emerged because of challenges in Fujian, such as fouling, high temperature stress, and unexpected extreme weather events. From the view of ecology and conservation biology, however, the potential ecological risks of this practice should be considered as the abalone shells could act as vectors of exotic organisms. In this study, oyster samples from the shells of live, farmed abalones were collected in Fujian in southern and Rongcheng in northern China. The oysters were identified using a recently developed molecular method. In addition, the fouling oysters on Pacific abalone transferred to the northern region were monitored in a field trial. Survivorship and growth performance of the fouling oysters on the transferred abalones were determined through investigation of digital images taken at 2-wk intervals during the oversummering period. Results of the molecular analysis showed that fouling oysters collected from southern and northern regions are Crassostrea angulata and Crassostrea gigas, respectively. The field trial demonstrated that approximately half of the C. angulata, from the southern region, were still alive after a 6-mo oversummering period in the northern region.

The current status of the population in this key location is described using population and aggregation surveys from 2004 to 2007. We developed a size-based matrix model to assess the recovery potential of this low-density population. We incorporated fecundity parameters into the model, modified by empirical nearest-neighbor distance, aggregation size, sex ratio, and size-frequency data, to evaluate their influence on the population growth rate. We found the density of the population (similar to 170 abalone/ha) is an order of magnitude less than the minimum spawning density (2,000 abalone/ha) used by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for abalone management. The average aggregation size was similar to 2 abalone, and more than 50% of the abalone were solitary (no neighbors within a 2.5-m distance). The average nearest-neighbor distance was greater than 5 m in all 3 y, corresponding to an estimated fertilization success rate of similar to 20%. The per capita recruitment potential was 1.3-5.3 recruits per female in 2006 and 2007. Population growth rates (lambda) from the models including aggregation characteristics were 12%-18% less than the models with no aggregation information. A further 12% reduction in lambda occurred between models assuming high and low fertilization success (high, 1.04/y; low, 0.91/y), showing that inclusion of aggregation characteristics has a large impact on population viability analyses. Under the International Union for the Conservation of Nature threat categories, a population with a lambda of 0.91 would be classified as endangered. Based on these results, we define recovery targets for pink abalone as (1) aggregation size >= 5 abalone and (2) nearest-neighbor distance less than 1.6 m. We suggest aggregation characteristics will be important to include when quantifying recovery goals for depleted populations of species susceptible to reproductive Allee effects.",10.2983/035.032.0124,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,APR,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.032.0124,

Between 2002 and 2005, the Bamfield Huu-ay-aht Community Abalone Project released 4.5 million larvae and 152,000 juveniles of the northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana) into Barkley Sound, BC. The purpose of this study was to estimate the long-term survival of outplanted abalone 3-7 years after their release and thus determine their contribution to local population densities at three different outplanting sites. We identified outplanted abalone by genotyping epipodal tentacles sampled from wild-caught abalone for seven microsatellite loci. We then used three different pedigree reconstruction programs: one that used genotypes from hatchery-reared siblings (pedigree 2.2), one that used the wild parent genotypes that were available (cervus 3.0), and one that used both sources of information (colony 2.0). Each program identified different but partially overlapping subsets of hatchery-outplanted offspring. From this we inferred that up to 26% of the individuals sampled at the main outplanting site were from hatchery spawnings. Despite this large contribution of hatchery-reared stock, the density of mature abalone at each site was below the level required for successful fertilization. More intensive outplanting efforts might increase population densities of this broadcast spawner above this minimum sustainable level. However, for supplementation to be successful, other factors that could reduce outplanted juvenile survival, including the low genetic diversity of hatchery-produced offspring and the low habitat quality of some outplanting sites, need to be monitored.",10.1007/s10592-012-0330-5,"Read, Kaitlyn/0000-0003-0793-1396; Boulding, Elizabeth/0000-0002-6852-7728",1566-0621,1572-9737,,JUN,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-012-0330-5,

The larvae performed significantly better in biofilms compared with controls across microalgal strains, but attachment, metamorphosis, shell stage, and survival were generally less than about 50, 35, 25, and 25%, respectively. Some microalgal strains belonging to the same species but collected from different sites had different effects on the larvae, likely due to variations in biochemical composition and activity among strains. Although no clear relationship was found between the microalgal amino acid profiles and larval processes, percentage biofilm cover and total amino acids were positively correlated with some of these processes. In addition, abalone performed significantly better when exposed to mature compared with young biofilms.

Further development of the sector will affect the provision of ecosystem services that maintain the livelihood of local populations. In particular, the current size and growth rate of China's mariculture has raised many environmental concerns, but very few studies of this sector have been conducted to date. Here, we report the resource use in the production of six main Chinese mariculture products (Larimichthys crocea, Apostichopus japonicus, Haliotis spp., Laminaria japonica, Gracilaria spp., Porphyra spp.), taking the city of Ningde as a case study. We used the life cycle assessment framework and the Cumulated Exergy Demand indicator to quantify resource use, and implemented a Monte Carlo simulation where model uncertainty was included using various methods. The mean exergy demand values of the production of one live-weight ton of large yellow croaker, sea cucumber, abalone, laminaria, gracilaria, and porphyra are 106 GJ eq., 65 GJ eq., 126 GJ eq., 0.25 GJ eq., 1.55 GJ eq., and 0.98 GJ eq., respectively. For animal products, 45-90% of the impacts come from the feed requirements, while in seaweed production, 83-99% of the impacts are linked to the fuel used in operation and maintenance activities. Policies oriented toward efficient resource management in the mariculture sector thus should take the farm design, input management, and spatial planning of marine areas as the main targets to guide current practices into more sustainable ones in the future.

This is the first report of cultivation of P. palmata in land-based tanks using isolated spores as seedstocks. Spores were released from field-collected tetrasporphytic fronds. A phenological study determined that tetrasporophytic fronds were fertile during the winter along the coast of northern France. This paper describes techniques for the induction of sporulation, for spore settlement and for incubation of germlings in 1.5-m-diameter tanks in semi-controlled conditions. The yield of released spores was in the range of 5000 to 25,000 g(-1) of fertile sections. Mean spore density on substrate placed in hatching tanks was 500 spores cm(-2). Spore germination occurred 3 days after inoculation and at this stage survival rate was high (80%). A few days after spore inoculation, both male and female gametophytes had germinated and a male to female ratio of approximately 1:1 was observed. Female gametophytic discs remained microscopic whereas males developed gametophytic fronds. Growth of plantlets was well correlated with the concentration of medium supplements. After 3 months of cultivation in tanks, survival rate was 35% and some plantlets measured more than 2 cm.

H. australis can be readily ripened and spawned, but larval settlement has proved difficult. The current study addressed aspects of larval settlement (i.e., attachment and metamorphosis) in laboratory experiments and small-scale hatchery trials. Competence to metamorphose was first seen weakly in larvae at 8 days old at 14.5 degrees C, but larval metamorphosis rates increased progressively up to at least 12 days of age. In laboratory experiments, larvae showed a dose-dependent response to dissolved gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), with settlement peaking at 1 mu M (57% metamorphosis 4 days after settlement induction) and declining at higher and lower doses. Across a range of cues, metamorphosis was highest on crustose coralline algae (97 +/- 4% metamorphosis after 4 days), intermediate on 1 mu M GABA (55 +/- 14%), and low on diatom films (<20%). GABA combined additively with diatom film to give strong metamorphosis (81 +/- 6%). Metamorphosis induction by a diatom film was doubled if the film was pregrazed by juvenile H. australis (76% vs. 35%, P<0.0001), but the grazing effect appeared to be species specific, because pregrazing by Haliotis iris had no effect (41% vs. 35%, P = 0.720). The species-specific response to trail mucus appears to preclude GABA as being the main inducer of metamorphosis in this case. On hatchery plates, settlement on pregrazed biofilms was approximately 4-fold higher when the plates were horizontal rather than vertical (41% vs. 10% metamorphosis, P = 0.003). Settlement on ungrazed horizontal plates remained low even if those plates had been held in water with adult conspecifics, but without contacting the abalone. We conclude that tanks offering sloped or horizontal surfaces will be more effective than vertical plates for settlement of H. australis, and that pregrazed biofilms and/or GABA are promising settlement cues.",10.2983/035.029.0316,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,NOV,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.029.0316,

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling is considered as a prominent signaling pathway in vertebrate as well as invertebrate species. Within the signaling cascade, TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) and TNF receptor-associated protein (TTRAP) has been shown to have a crucial role in the modulation of immune signaling in animals. Here, we attempted to characterize a novel molluskan ortholog of TTRAP (AbTTRAP) from disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) and analyzed its expression levels under pathogenic stress. The complete coding sequence of AbTTRAP consisted of 1071 nucleotides, coding for a 357 amino acid peptide, with a predicted molecular mass of 40 kDa. According to our in-silico analysis, AbTTRAP resembled the typical TTRAP domain architecture, including a 5'-tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase domain. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis revealed its common ancestral invertebrate origin, where AbTTRAP was clustered with molluskan counterparts. Quantitative real time PCR showed universally distributed expression of AbTTRAP in selected tissues of abalone, from which more prominent expression was detected in hemocytes. Upon stimulation with two pathogen-derived mitogens, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), transcript levels of AbTTRAP in hemocytes and gill tissues were differentially modulated with time. In addition, the recombinant protein of AbTTRAP exhibited prominent endonuclease activity against abalone genomic DNA, which was enhanced by the presence of Mg2+ in the medium. Collectively, these results reinforce the existence of the TNF signaling cascade in mollusks like disk abalone, further implicating the putative regulatory behavior of TTRAP in invertebrate host pathology.

Abalones are an important marine fishery resource and of cultural importance to Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. A highly priced marine delicacy, they are inherently vulnerable: individuals are slow-growing and long-lived and successful reproduction requires dense assemblages. However, their global conservation status is poorly understood. Using IUCN Red List methodology, we assessed the extinction risk to all 54 species of abalone (genus Haliotis). Of the 21 fished commercially for human consumption either now and/or in the past, 15 (71.43%) are classified as threatened, i.e., those identified as Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable. Of the 33 unexploited species, only five (15.15%) are so classified, making exploited species over four times more likely to face extinction, underscoring the impact of fishing on abalones already confronting a changing climate. The highest concentration of threatened species occurs along the North American Pacific coast. Here six of the seven species have been exploited, yet despite years of fishery closures with exemptions only in Alaska and Mexico, all are categorised as threatened. Climate driven stressors have led to mass mortalities, with competition from sea urchins and disease, aggravated by harmful algal blooms. In Australia the picture is mixed despite robust stock management, with some regions experiencing mass mortalities from marine heatwaves and viral spread. Poaching has reached its apogee in South Africa, where organised criminal gangs have reduced the legal fishery of Haliotis midae, 'perlemoen' almost to a footnote, accompanied by widespread recruitment failure. In response, the authorities have focused on abalone ranching and stock enhancement.

The results reveal that GS variants exhibit higher expression of visual protein genes (e.g., RHO-opnGq), which are linked to light sensitivity and pigment synthesis. Additionally, RS variants show upregulated chitin biosynthesis genes (e.g., CHs-IA), potentially influencing shell structure and pigmentation. These findings suggest that these genes play a critical role in regulating pigment deposition and shell colour formation, while biomineralisation genes contribute to shell integrity. This study provides new insights into the genetic basis of shell colour variation and its ecological significance, offering valuable information for selective breeding programs.",10.1016/j.cbd.2025.101461,,1744-117X,1878-0407,,SEP,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbd.2025.101461,40054054

Positive feedback is often presented as central in maintaining alternative ecosystem states, but no formal approach relates this part of theory to real world applications. Through qualitative modelling of community response to long-term perturbations, we define generic mechanistic links between positive feedback and the occurrence of alternative states. Positive feedback diminishes a system's overall resistance to change, and can create and maintain correlations in the relative abundance of variables that coincide with alternative states. Through specific models of the dynamics of Tasmanian rocky-reef communities, which are affected by climate and fishing and persist within alternative states, we demonstrate the ability of our theoretical framework to predict alternative states in ecosystems and inform management intervention. A qualitative knowledge of community structure permits a thorough analysis of system feedback and an assessment of the potential for an ecosystem to exhibit alternative states. We illustrate the usefulness of the approach to inform management priorities, and to focus monitoring and field research on the key drivers of ecosystem dynamics. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This study explored the potential impact of the proposed disposal of over 7 million m(3) of dredge spoil on a nearby fishery for the blackfoot abalone Haliotis iris. The range of sediment deposition predicted by models to occur on reefs inhabited by H. iris as a result of the dispersal of sediment from the disposal site was used to design controlled experiments between July and September 2011 to test the likely effects of sedimentation on: (a) behaviour and mortality of juvenile H. iris and (b) photosynthetic vitality of crustose coralline algae (CCA) that form nursery habitats for H. iris obtained from Brinns Point (45, 40.3'S, 170, 39.4'E). We observed no direct effects on the health or mortality of H. iris juveniles or the photosynthetic vitality of habitat forming CCA. H. iris did, however, avoid sediments by moving from predation refugia beneath cobbles to vertical surfaces on cobble edges significantly more often in sediment treatments compared to sediment-free controls. Deposited sediments were also found to inhibit righting response, key behaviour in allowing H. iris to reattach to the substratum following dislodgement. Results of this study suggest that indirect mortality from reductions in available refugia from predation and inability to recover from dislodgement could be significant. These results highlight the importance of understanding indirect impacts of stressors on key ecological processes in order to predict ecological responses.",10.1007/s00227-013-2173-0,"Stephenson, Wayne/0000-0002-4020-5639",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAY,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-013-2173-0,

This study identifies issues to be considered by stakeholders in developing certification standards for channel catfish, tilapias, rainbow trout, oysters, mussels, clams, scallops, abalone, and seaweed. Common issues include land and water use, water pollution, benthic effects, effects on biodiversity use of antibiotics and other chemicals, and relationships with workers and local communities. Specific, contentious issues apply to individual species or species groups. Fish meal use in feeds will be a major concern in finfish certification. Use of groundwater removal of daily mortalities, and medicated feed in channel catfish culture should be given particular attention. Tilapia culture can introduce these species into watersheds where they have not previously occurred, resulting in serious competition with native species. Some environmentalists and consumers object to hormone treatment of tilapia to produce all male fry. Widespread use of therapeutic agents in trout culture will be a major concern. Discussions of shellfish certification should focus on water use conflicts and public health risks associated with the consumption of these organisms. The introduction of non-native species and genetic alterations with respect to oysters also will need to be addressed.

Here, we use qualitative modelling of system feedback to understand the cumulative impacts of multiple species shifts in south-eastern Australia, a global hotspot for ocean warming. We identify range-shifting species that can induce trophic cascades and affect ecosystem dynamics and productivity, and evaluate the potential effectiveness of alternative management interventions to mitigate these impacts. Our results suggest that the negative ecological impacts of multiple simultaneous range shifts generally add up. Thus, implementing whole-of-ecosystem management strategies and regular monitoring of range-shifting species of ecological concern are necessary to effectively intervene against undesirable consequences of marine range shifts at the regional scale.

Abalone recruitment is related to the algal community type, with abalone shifting with growth from deeper crustose coralline algal (CCA) habitats to shallower kelp bed habitats via algal turfs. Timing of the habitat shifts is linked to ontogenetic changes in diet, from benthic diatoms to a diet dominated by macroalgae. Susceptibility to predation appears to change, concomitant with the shift from cryptic microhabitats during early-life stages to more exposed habitats during latter-life stages. Interstitial spaces between cobbles and boulders in the CCA habitat are considered to be important for reducing predation risk.

The deduced protein has an estimated molecular weight of 13.9 kDa and a predicted PI of 8.73. Its genomic DNA comprises 4352 bp, containing three exons and two introns. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that saGABARAP was constitutively expressed in all examined tissues, with the highest expression level in hepatopancreas, and was upregulated in hepatopancreas and hemocytes after bacterial challenge. In addition, saGABARAP was ubiquitously expressed at all examined embryonic and larval development stages. These results suggested that saGABARAP could respond to bacteria challenge and may play a vital role in the adult innate immune system against pathogens and the development process of abalone embryo and larvae.

The results indicate that the PEI-SV method is more efficient and convenient in gene delivery into abalone eggs compared with the microinjection method and the conventional sperm vector method. A significant proportion (13.9%) of the fertilized eggs developed normally into blastomeres and expressed green fluorescent protein at high level after gene transfer with the PEI-SV method, and 7.6% of them survived to the trochophore stage. PCR analysis suggests that the mechanism of PEI-SV gene transfer method was that PEI/DNA was taken up by spermatozoa and carried into eggs during fertilization.

However, this progression needs to be sustainable, which can potentially be achieved by the implementation of circular practices. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems promote the incorporation of circular principles. Nevertheless, the lack of harmonized definitions and standards impedes the quantification of these circular attributes. This study aims to explore the potential principles embedded in IMTA and the existing alternatives to quantify circularity. Two basic pillars (nutrient management and resource use efficiency) were identified as the most relevant circularity attributes for IMTA systems and were quantified through aquaculture-specific indicators. Bioremediation indicators, together with the efficiency indicators in terms of feed, water, energy, and infrastructure materials used, were selected to evaluate the circularity performance of four IMTA trials in three aquaculture facilities in Ireland, Brazil, and South Africa. Salmon, white shrimp, tilapia, abalone, and sea urchins were studied and cultivated together in various combinations with several low-trophic species in these IMTA trials to evaluate the improvement in circularity compared with corresponding monoculture conditions.

Abalone, broadcast-spawning marine snails associated with shallow rocky habitats, have experienced widespread declines, and all seven North American species are threatened. We investigated the connectivity and population genomics of pinto/northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana), the widest-ranging of abalone species. We employed reduced representation sequencing (RADseq) to generate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, assessing population connectivity and potential adaptive variation at 12 locations across the full range from Alaska to Mexico. Despite depleted populations, our analysis of over 6000 SNPs across nearly 300 individuals revealed that pinto abalone maintains a high genetic diversity with no evidence of a genetic bottleneck. Neutral population structure and isolation by distance were extremely weak, indicating panmixia across the species' range (global FST = 0.0021). Phylogenetic analysis, principal components analysis, and unsupervised clustering methods all supported a single genetic population. However, slight population differentiation was noted in the Salish Sea and Inside Passage regions, with evidence for higher barriers to dispersal relative to outer coastal areas. This north-central region may also represent the species' ancestral range based on relatively low population-specific FST values; the northern and southern extremes of the range likely represent range expansions. Outlier analysis did not identify consensus loci implicated in adaptive variation, suggesting limited adaptive differentiation.

Meeting this cost would require 1.3 to 1.7 mu g of biomass (ash-free dry mass), which is similar to the initial biomass of the spawned oocyte at 1.36 +/- 0.04 mu g (mean of four cultures). However, there was no net loss of biomass during development from the oocyte to the juvenile, The uptake of alanine alanine and glucose from seawater by larvae and juveniles could provide one-third of the organic material required po supply metabolism, even if the transporters were only operating at 20% of their maximum capacity throughout development, For larvae undergoing metamorphosis (between 6- and 9-days-old) the proportion of total metabolic demand supplied using aerobically catabolized biomass was only 39%.

Decreasing water velocity increased the thickness of the DBL, thereby increasing the amplitude of changes in oxygen concentration.

In this study, newly hatched larvae of C. concholepas were used to investigate the effects of brine discharges of a reverse osmosis desalination plant on coastal organisms. Under laboratory conditions, larvae were exposed to various dilutions of a brine to assess the consequences on lethal (survival) and sublethal (swimming performance and metabolism) traits. The results indicated that brine discharges had no effects on larval survival. However, undiluted brines (ca. 56 PSU) and salinities above 38 PSU led to increased metabolic rates and a reduction in the swimming performance of the larvae. We suggest mitigating the negative effects of brines on newly hatched C. concholepas larvae by situating discharge points in highly hydrodynamic zones or as far as possible from mating and larval hatching areas.

Predator performance in the laboratory was assessed in conditions without prey refuge, in simulated juvenile habitat as well as in the presence of alternate prey. We then used surveys to compare the abundance of predators and juvenile abalone to explore if negative associations between predator and prey in the laboratory manifest in the field. Last, we manipulated algal habitat complexity at 2 depths and quantified the effect of predator exclusion on juvenile abalone survival in the field. We found that starfish were the likely predators of juvenile H. iris in our study system. Furthermore, predation of juvenile abalone by starfish was lowest in habitats with the greatest structural complexity, and there is evidence that predation by starfish in cobble habitats was size-dependent. Overall, we found that habitat variability mediates predation on juvenile abalone by determining the likelihood of an encounter between predator and prey.",10.3354/meps10380,"Aguirre, David/0000-0001-7520-441X",0171-8630,1616-1599,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps10380,

Levels of endogenous catecholamines increase 6 to 9 days after fertilization, when larvae become competent for metamorphosis. Six- to nine-day larvae, treated with the catecholamine precursor L-DOPA (0.01 mM for 0.5 h), were assayed for metamorphosis in response to coral inducer and for catecholamine content by high-performance liquid chromatography. L-DOPA treatment caused 20- to 50-fold increases in dopamine, with proportionally greater increases in younger larvae, so that L-DOPA-treated larvae of all ages contained similar levels of dopamine. A much smaller (about twofold) increase in norepinephrine occurred in all larvae. The treatment significantly potentiated the frequency of metamorphosis of 7- to 9-d larvae at low concentrations of inducer. In addition, L-DOPA treatment at 9 d increased aldehyde-induced fluorescence in cells that were also labeled in the controls, and revealed additional cells. However, all labeled cells were consistent with the locations of cells showing tyrosine-hydroxylase-like immunoreactivity. Catecholamines are likely to modulate metamorphosis in P. sibogae, but rising levels of catecholamines around the time of competence are insufficient alone to account for sensitivity to inducer in competent larvae.",10.2307/1542688,"Croll, Roger/0000-0002-9846-0923; Hadfield, Michael/0000-0002-8808-5197",0006-3185,1939-8697,,JUN,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1542688,10897446

The loco is present along the coast of Chile, in the Archipelago of Juan Fernandez and in southern and central Peril, and its range of distribution spans over 5,000 kin of intertidal and shallow subtidal reefs. In Chile, the loco is a traditional food resource and has been heavily exploited since the early Holocene by intertidal food-gathers and free divers, and since the 1950s; 60s by a small-scale artisan fleet of hookah-divers. In Chile, since the mid-1970s, the species has been mainly exported (foot-meat) to Asian markets, and between 1976 and 1980 market demands acted as a major driving force behind overexploitation of the loco. Since the 1990s, its fishery moved from an open access regime to a comanagement regulated policy based on territorial user rights for fisheries (TURF) and reproductive fishery bans. The loco, as an iconic species, played a key role in the implementation of TURF. In Peru, the loco fishery operates under a reproductive ban fishery regime and its export started in the late 1990s. In Chile, the loco is by far the most intensely studied of all exploited shellfishes in terms of evolution, paleobiogeography, biogeography, life history, behavior. physiology, ecology. genetics, and fishery. Moreover, the loco has been used as a biological model to study responses to global stressors such as ocean warming and acidification. During the past 20 y, several laboratory experimental attempts have been made to advance experimental, pilot, and commercial aquaculture of the loco. Nevertheless, the available information shows that no reliable and repeatable pilot or massive aquaculture protocols have yet succeeded. In this study, the extensive field and laboratory information for the most relevant life history phases of the loco, such as reproduction, mating, brood-stock holding, egg capsule deposition, larval posthatching, growing to competence, larval feeding, settlement and metamorphosis to juvenile stages, and pilot growing experiences to adult sizes are reviewed. In light of the available information, the most critical aquaculture bottlenecks are identified. Among them, the existence, from hatching to competence, of a long larval planktonic phase of about 3-4 mo, and the existence of cannibalism during postsettlement confined laboratory conditions are highlighted. Moreover. key aspects of the larval rearing of the loco. such as densities, field and laboratory food items, and temperatures are reported. The field collection of (1) competent larvae of locos in inshore coastal plankton; (2) new settlers from rocky shores; and (3) new settlers from fishery-discarded conspecific shells are also discussed. The collection of competent larvae was followed by laboratory induction to settlement and by two consecutive postsettlement rearing/growing phases (laboratory and field conditions) to overcome difficulties associated with the long larval phase and to speed up the time required to reach trading sizes. Furthermore, collection of new settlers was followed by rearing experiments under both laboratory and field conditions. The need of high demands of live prey (mainly mussels) during the laboratory rearing of the early benthic stages of loco is discussed, emphasizing that to implement ecologically sustainable aquaculture practices, parallel aquaculture of the appropriated prey is needed. A review of what is already known regarding the biology of C. concholepas is provided along with progress and pit-falls for the aquaculture of this species. The practicality for its aquaculture and the main challenges ahead are also discussed.",10.2983/035.037.0520,"Manriquez, Patricio/0000-0001-6586-764X",0730-8000,1943-6319,,DEC,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.037.0520,

Such marks are required to 'time stamp' the shells and thus determine whether shell layers are deposited regularly enough to be used to age abalone. The stains used were: oxytetracycline and tetracycline at 300-1000 mg L(-1); calcein at 10-120 mg L(-1); alizarin red S at 10-60 mg L(-1); and xylenol orange at 20-100 mg L(-1). Immersion times were 12, 24 and 48 h. Mortality rates were low in all treatments, and clearly discernible marks were produced when abalone were immersed for 24 and 48 h at high concentrations in all the stains. Three problems were encountered when tetracyclines were employed: (i) the solutions were acidic, so the pH had to be adjusted with NaOH to prevent mortality; (ii) there was excessive foaming of the solutions; and (iii) a natural fluorescence in the shells closely resembled that of the tetracyclines. Problems also arose in assessing alizarin red and xylenol orange because they have long emission wavelengths, so that simultaneously viewing natural layers on the sections is difficult, Calcein, although expensive, was the most effective, as at high concentrations it consistently produced bright, extensive marks. The success of marking appeared to depend on the growth rate of the abalone, as feeding before staining increased the intensity of marks, and marking varied between batches of abalone collected at different times.",10.1071/MF9950599,"Day, Robert/0000-0001-5913-2292",1323-1650,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF9950599,

Out of the range of sea otters, live abalones were over twice as large and were numerous outside crevices (when protected from human predation). At the study site within their range, sea otters selected abalones larger than were proportionately available in crevices, and they broke many large shells with stone tools. An average of 55 freshly produced empty abalone shells, equivalent to .apprxeq. 20% of the crevice population of live abalones, were found each month in the study area over a 12-mo. period. Indirect calculations of feeding rates of sea otters also indicated a high production rate of abalones, as did observations of abalones in mapped crevices.

Weight-standardized rates (ingestion, assimilation, respiration, ammonia excretion, and fecal excretion) of small (juvenile), medium (mature), and large (mature) sea cucumbers were measured and energy budgets constructed to quantify their growth rates when offered three different diets at 14, 16, and 18 C. Three types of diet were offered: uneaten abalone food (diet A) and two types of abalone feces, one where abalone were fed 50% Macrocystis pyrifera and 50% Undaria pinnatifida macroalgae (diet B) and the other where abalone were fed 25% M. pyrifera, 25% U. pinnatifida, and 50% Adam & Amos Abalone Food, where the latter is an industry standard diet (diet C). The organic contents of the diets were much higher than natural sediments and varied such that diet A (76.40%) > diet B (54.50%) > diet C (37.00%). Diet had a significant effect on S. mollis ingestion rates, assimilation efficiencies, and consequently energy budgets and growth rates. Greater quantities of organic matter (OM) from diet A and diet B were ingested and assimilated by the sea cucumbers compared with the OM in diet C. The energy budgets indicated that after taking routine metabolism into account, all sizes of sea cucumbers had energy to allocate to growth when offered diet A and diet B, but only juveniles had energy to allocate to growth when offered diet C. Fecal excretion rates when offered diet A and diet C at 14 C were greater than those at 18 C, but neither was significantly different from that at 16 C. Ammonia excretion rates increased nonlinearly with temperature for small and medium sea cucumbers but not for large sea cucumbers. Weight-standardized respiration rates increased with temperature and unexpectedly with animal size, which may have been because of the narrow weight range of test animals biasing the results. These results suggest that industry standard type abalone waste lacks sufficient energy to meet the metabolic requirements of mature sea cucumbers but that growing juveniles on these wastes appears to be feasible and warrants further investigation.",10.1111/j.1749-7345.2009.00239.x,"Gardner, Jonathan/0000-0002-6943-2413",0893-8849,,,APR,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2009.00239.x,

The culture of Caulerpa lentillifera as a biofilter did not work in the open sea cultivation system using baskets. Monthly measurements of shell length, width and body weight of the cultured abalones, together with in situ measurements of physicochemical parameters to assess any changes in water quality, mainly nitrate, nitrite, ammonia and phosphate, were conducted over a year period from February 2013 to January 2014 in three designated stations (Abalone, Seaweed and Control Stations) at three different depths (surface, middle and bottom). Cage culture of abalone side by side with seaweeds in the open sea did not result in any significant water quality disturbance in the area at least not in the current volume of caged abalones being used. Of the four inorganic compounds monitored in the field, nitrate and ammonia in the Seaweed Station were shown to have relatively lower year-round average values when compared with the Abalone Station, although in the case of nitrate, it was higher in the Control Station compared with the abalone and Seaweed Stations. Although this difference was not significant, it shows the red seaweeds, G. heteroclada and E. denticulatum, to be functioning as a natural filter for these two nutrients. In contrast, nitrite, and phosphate concentrations were not reduced indicating that the seaweeds were not effective biofilter for these two nutrients. The two-month old hatchery-bred donkey's ear abalones can grow to a size of 53.8 x 28.2 mm (L x W) and body weight of 37.8 g after a period of 12 months. Any expansion of the farm into a much larger commercial-scale farm will have to be complimented with seaweeds stocked around it if only to mitigate possible build-up of excess inorganic wastes to serve as both a natural filter and as a source of natural feed. The potential use of an organic extractive species has to be further studied under farm condition to achieve its full potential as an IMTA species. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Since then there have been considerable changes. There are three main uses of kelp (mostly Ecklonia maxima, with some Laminaria pallida) in South Africa. The collection of wash-up for drying and exporting for alginate extraction has drastically reduced to very small amounts in recent years. The boat harvest of fresh kelp for abalone feed in land-based farms has reached a plateau of between 4000 and 5000 t fresh per annum. The diver harvest of E. maxima for agricultural liquid plant growth enhancer shows a constant increase over several years, is still growing, and is currently over 3000 t fresh per annum. The small intertidal collection of Gelidium pristoides as export for agar production has maintained a small, sustainable production of around 100 t dry for many years. Former Gracilaria industries in sheltered bays in both South Africa and Namibia have collapsed, and there is currently no commercial collection. There was commercial raft aquaculture production of Gracilaria in Luderitz Bay, Namibia for a number of years, but this is no longer practised. Currently, the only commercial seaweed use in Namibia is of L. pallida. Annually, ca. 150 t of fresh wash-up is collected, in Luderitz, to be used as feed in land-based abalone aquaculture. There are a number of small start-up companies experimenting with seaweed products for cosmetics and nutritional products in both countries, some involving species of Ulva and Porphyra.

The results showed that all STRLOs were negative by ISH for CXc and pCXc, suggesting that the ST-RLO is a different species of bacterium and that it is not susceptible to infection by pCXc. Histologically similar alterations to those produced by CXc in the post esophagus were observed. The three RLOs regularly coexist in all the infected abalones, and there is a relatively constant proportion of each kind of RLO over time, suggesting that equilibrium is reached during coexistence; the largest percentage corresponded to CXc non phage infected (81%), followed by CXc infected by pCXc (16%) and the ST-RLO (3%). In all cases, the ST-RLO infection remained at a subclinical level making it difficult to determine if it acts as pathogen or as a commensal. Therefore, the genetic characterization of the STRLO and pathogenicity studies are needed to further elucidate the role of this new RLO in the development of of WS in abalone species of North America.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.736026,"Vasquez-Yeomans, Rebeca/0000-0001-9481-810X; Caceres-Martinez, Jorge/0000-0003-1982-5240",0044-8486,1873-5622,,Feb-15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.736026,

Abalone fisheries are mainly seen in Wando on the south coast of Korea, where seaweed aquaculture has been majorly conducted. Mass mortality of abalone spats is considered a major problem in abalone fisheries and is caused by changes in environmental factors and food availability (including availability of benthic diatoms). However, it is difficult to supply sufficient quantities of benthic diatoms to post-larvae abalone. Therefore, we explored the development of growth-promoting substances for diatoms Navicula sp. and experimentally mixed several substances to enhance the growth of diatoms. In this study, we used alginic acid, fucoidan, Scytosiphon lomentaria, Ecklonia cava, Ecklonia cava processing byproduct (i.e., Ecklonia cava-boiled extracts, EBE), and Porphyra tenera. In addition, EBE, phosphate fertilizer (PF), nitrogenous manure (NM), and sodium silicate (SS) were mixed to determine the optimal composition of growth substances. The growth of diatoms significantly increased under EBE exposure, compared with other substances.

Higher values were obtained at low densities (<1% of embryos bottom-coverage and <1 larvae/ml), except for the growth of larvae, which was similar among treatments. Higher larval survival was recorded using the static culture system, and higher percent of post-larvae recovered was associated with lower density of crawling veliger (0.2 and 0.1/ml), while its higher growth rate was related to the use of biofilms with conspecific mucus and low water-flow (50%/h).

The Of-mMnSOD protein portrayed distinct MnSOD family features including signature motifs, metal association sites and the typical active site topology. It was also predicted to be localized in mitochondrial matrix. The Of-mMnSOD had a quinquepartite genome organization encompassing five exons interrupted by four introns. Comparison of its sequence and gene structure with that of other lineages emphasized its strong conservation among different vertebrates. The Of-mMnSOD was ubiquitously transcribed in different rock bream tissues with higher levels in blood cells and metabolically active tissues. Transcription of Of-mMnSOD was kinetically modulated in response to investigational challenges using mitogens (lipopolysaccharide and poly I:C) and live-pathogens (Edwardsiella tarda and rock bream irido virus) in blood cells and liver tissue. The purified recombinant Of-mMnSOD possessed potential antioxidant capacity and actively survived over a range of pH (7.5-11) and temperature (15-40 degrees C) conditions.

We elucidate the role of the sediment reduction-oxidation (redox) regime in structuring benthic bacterial communities, having direct implications for bioremediation potential and deposit-feeder nutrition. The sea cucumber Holothuria scabra was cultured on sediments under contrasting redox regimes; fully oxygenated (oxic) and redox stratified (oxic-anoxic). Taxonomically, metabolically and functionally distinct bacterial communities developed between the redox treatments with the oxic treatment supporting the greater diversity; redox regime and dissolved oxygen levels were the main environmental drivers. Oxic sediments were colonised by nitrifying bacteria with the potential to remediate nitrogenous wastes. Percolation of oxygenated water prevented the proliferation of anaerobic sulphate-reducing bacteria, which were prevalent in the oxic-anoxic sediments. At the predictive functional level, bacteria within the oxic treatment were enriched with genes associated with xenobiotics metabolism. Oxic sediments showed the greater bioremediation potential; however, the oxic-anoxic sediments supported a greater sea cucumber biomass.

This study assessed the role of sea cucumber stocking density and frequency of tank cleaning in IMTA on growth, water, and sludge bioremediation. The study was conducted for 16 weeks and was made of four treatments and four replicates; abalone cocultured with sea cucumber (low density-27: 1 g [abalone (ab): sea cucumber (sc)]) with tanks cleaned once a week (L1); abalone cocultured with sea cucumber (low density) with tanks cleaned twice a week (L2); abalone cocultured with sea cucumber (high density-15:1 g [ab:sc]) with tanks cleaned once a week (H1) and abalone cocultured with sea cucumber (high density) with tanks cleaned twice a week (H2). Rearing water nitrite was significantly lower (p = 0.001) at high stocking density of sea cucumbers, but sludge was unaffected. Tanks cleaned once weekly had higher sludge organic matter (p = 0.015) and sludge sulfur content (p = 0.020) and lower sludge carbon (p = 0.003) and nitrogen content (p = 0.049).

However, in addition to this principal role, they can also function in multiple host defense processes, including cell phagocytosis and hydrolysis of peptidoglycans (PGNs). In this study, a novel invertebrate short-type PGRP was identified in disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) designated as AbPGRP. The complete coding sequence of AbPGRP was 534 bp, encoding a 178-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 20 kDa. The AbPGRP gene had a bipartite arrangement consisting of two exons separated by a single intron. Homology analysis revealed that AbPGRP shares conserved features, including amino acid residues critical for substrate and ion binding as well as for its amidase activity, with homologs of other species. Phylogenetic analysis of AbPGRP revealed that it likely evolved from a common ancestor of invertebrates, having significant homology with other molluscan PGRPs. Recombinant AbPGRP exhibited detectable, dose-dependent PGN-hydrolyzing activity with the presence of Zn2+, and strong antibacterial activity against Vibrio tapetis, consistent with the functional properties previously reported for PGRPs in other mollusks. Moreover, AbPGRP transcription was induced upon treatment of healthy abalones with bacterial peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide, although the expression profiles differed with treatment, suggesting a capacity for discriminating between bacterial pathogens through molecular pattern recognition. Collectively, the findings of this study indicate that AbPGRP is a true homolog of invertebrate PGRPs and likely plays an indispensable role in host immunity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Following acclimation to clean seawater, three abalones were separately exposed to a 6-h sublethal concentration of PCP (1.2 mg l-1) until the spectral resonance for inorganic monophosphate (P(i)) was half-height to that of phosphoarginine (PA); the endpoint assured that all individuals were metabolically equivalent at the start of air exposure. They were exposed to clean seawater for 2 h to allow the effects from PCP to stabilize, then air for 45 min, and finally clean seawater for 15 h to check recovery. The effects of PCP in foot muscle included a decrease in the concentrations of PA and adenosine triphosphate ([PA] and [ATP], respectively), an increase in P(i), and a decrease in intracellular pH (pH(i)). Upon air exposure, [PA] and pH(i) rapidly declined further, [P(i)] increased, and [ATP] did not change; the magnitudes were similar to those from emergence alone. After resubmergence, both [PA] and [P(i)] recovered rapidly from the effects of hypoxia, but slowly from those of PCP. While pH(i) initially declined further, both [ATP] and pH(i) recovered to near-initial levels after 15 h. In general, the metabolic effects of hypoxia did not change upon pretreatment with PCP; the biochemical interaction of the two factors was additive. Another three abalones were separately exposed to PCP at an environmentally relevant concentration of 120-mu-g l-1 for 6 h, air for 1 h, then the same PCP concentration for 2.5 h to check recovery.

Histological examination of affected scallops in southern Hokkaido typically revealed intense host responses: hemocyte infiltration, an abundance of necrotic hemocytes, lysis of muscle fibers and in some instances melanin deposits when the lesions occurred adjacent to the shell. Microbiota analysis showed that Francisella halioticida was dominant in the lesions, and in situ hybridization using F. halioticida specific probes also confirmed the presence of this bacterium within the lesions. A F. halioticida specific PCR assay detected this bacterium in the majority of scallop lesions tested. Subsequently, three bacterial isolates were obtained from scallop lesions on modified Eugon agar supplemented with antibiotics, and these bacterial isolates were found to be F. halioticida by 16S rRNA and rpoB gene sequences. These results suggest that infection with F. halioticida is the most likely cause of the adductor muscle lesions observed in Yesso scallops.

In this study, a quantitative analysis was performed on the motion behaviour characteristics of abalones exposed to different light cycles (0 L:24D, 12 L:12D, 24 L:0D) using infrared camera and behavioural analysis software. A preliminary analysis of the intrinsic correlations between melatonin secretion and abalone behaviour rhythms was also conducted. The results showed that the cumulative moving distance and duration of movement for abalone in the 0 L:24D group were significantly higher than those in the 12 L:12D and 24 L:0D groups (P < 0.05). The mean and maximum moving velocities of abalones in the 12 L:12D group were significantly higher than those in the 0 L:24D group (P < 0.05).

At 3- to 4-mo intervals between May 1995 and July 1996, five collections of 10 adult abalone (equal sexes) were made from the West Coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Each animal's live mass (without shell) was recorded, and its gonad was aspirated from the digestive gland into a known volume land mass) of seawater. The digestive gland was sliced free of its attachment, weighed, and related to shelf-less body mass as percent digestive gland index (DGI). The gonad live mass was determined from the mass of aspirated mix of gonad and seawater, and related to shell-less body mass to give a percent gonad index (GI). Digestive gland cells were prepared and maintained in a special buffer, and their Vo(2)'s measured in microrespirometers. There was no sex effect on seasonal DGI, but significant seasonal differences in DGIs correlated perfectly with metabolic activity of digestive-gland cells with glucose substrate. Thus, when digestive glands were largest relative to body size, metabolic activity of their cells was greatest. GIs were significantly higher for males than females. There was a significant seasonal effect on GIs, with Values being high in springtime before spawning (April to May, 10-11%) and low in winter (December, 6%), but with statistical overlap between these and summer values (July to August, 7-8%).

It is important to elucidate the process of reproductive development and its regulatory mechanism in seaweed. Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis (Rhodophyta) has an essential economic and ecological value, for example, as a raw material for agar extraction and abalone feed. Here, four phases (I to IV) of G. lemaneiformis tetrasporophyte development were analyzed using physiological assays and transcriptome technologies. The results showed that photosynthetic capacity increased during the period from tetraspore formation to the release (Phase II, III and IV). According to transcriptome results, the expression levels of genes associated with light harvesting, photosynthesis, and carbon fixation pathways were significantly upregulated during tetraspore formation and release. Meanwhile, the expression levels of genes encoding starch and trehalose synthesis enzymes in starch and sucrose metabolism were enhanced during tetraspore formation and release, suggesting that G. lemaneiformis requires more energy supply during reproductive development, and that trehalose-6-phosphate may also act as a signaling molecule to induce tetraspore formation. In addition, genes encoding antioxidant enzymes (APX, TRX, GR, TR, PRX, and CAT) were significantly upregulated during tetraspore formation. These results may help us to understand the transition from nutritional to reproductive development and the molecular mechanism of G. lemaneiformis tetrasporogenesis, which is vital for the development of new germplasm and promoting the growth of the seaweed culture industry.",10.3389/fmars.2022.1080474,,,2296-7745,,Jan-13,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.1080474,

Here are explanatory hypotheses for three kinds of pelagic development. (1) Pelagic development prior to ability to feed or settle avoids constraints of oxygen supply to aggregated embryos and scarcity of deposition sites. Also, costs of protection may be greater and survival benefits less than indicated by present evidence. (2) Obligately feeding pelagic larvae migrate to the plankton for greater growth or lower mortality. Under this hypothesis, the observed large scale dispersal is an incidental byproduct of a migration from benthic to pelagic habitat for greater growth or survival. Given pelagic development, unevenly favorable benthic environments and varying currents might result in selection for spread of sibling larvae as a form of bet hedging, but selection for dispersal as a result of pelagic development does not explain evolution of pelagic development. (3) For larvae released near competence for settlement and metamorphosis, the function of the pelagic stage is dispersal and habitat selection. For these larvae, the observed precompetent pelagic periods of seconds to a day may indicate pelagic durations adapted for dispersal because offspring could be protected until release at competence.",,,0007-4977,1553-6955,,SEP,,

The POs were isolated from hemocytes using lineargradient native-PAGE combined with catechol staining. The PO activities and their characters were investigated. The molecular mass of PO in C. farreri was 576 kDa, and it was 228 kDa in H. discus hannai. In S. subcrenata, four POs were detected and their molecular masses were 391 kDa, 206 kDa, 174 kDa and <67 kDa, which were named as 391-PO, 206-PO, 174-PO and s-PO, respectively. Kinetic analyses indicated that all of the POs, except for 391-PO had higher affinity to L-DOPA and catechol than to hydroquinone and dopamine. However, all of the POs failed to oxidize tyrosine. The effects of divalent metal ions on POs' activities were assayed, including Fe2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Cu2+ and Ca2+ from FeCl2, MgSO4, ZnSO4, MnCl2, CuSO4 and CaCl2.

The promotion of a sustainable aquaculture industry requires that decision-makers, ecosystem managers and farmers have sufficient quantitative information associated with its implementation from both public and private perspectives. The present paper applies the Differential Drivers Pressure State Impact Response (ADPSIR) methodological approach to an ecological and economic comparison between mono-aquaculture and IMTA. Data from a South African 240-ton year(-1) abalone farm were used as a case study. Three operation schemes were considered: abalone monoculture in a flow-through system; and two IMTA schemes, which recycle water and replace 10% and 30% of kelp consumption with on-farm-grown seaweed. The analysis indicates a decrease in the aquaculture generated ecological pressures with the incorporation of seaweeds, mainly a reduction in nitrogen discharges into the adjacent coastal ecosystem (by 3.7 to 5.0 tons year(-1) a reduction in harvest of natural kelp beds (by 2.2 to 6.6 ha year(-1)) and a reduction of GHG emissions (by 290 to 350 tons CO(2)e year(-1)). Adopting an IMTA configuration raised farm profits by 1.4 to 5%. The corresponding overall gain from using IMTA in the case study is several folds larger than the net gain in profit, and is estimated between 1.1 and 3.0 million U.S. dollar per annum. This range of values reflects the gains of adopting IMTA on (i) economic value of the aquaculture, i.e. farm's profit, (ii) value of environmental externalities, and (iii) implementation costs. The analysis suggests that the value of the benefits to the public by adopting the IMTA configurations can be larger than the gains in farm's profitability. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.

The polysaccharides' compositions were analysed, and their effects on HepG2 cell proliferation were assessed. AVAP I had a greater growth-stimulatory effect than AAP or AVAP II. The oligosaccharide of AVAP I (Oli-AVAP I) exhibited the same growth effects, but rhamnose, the primary monosaccharide of AVAP I and Oli-AVAP I, did not exhibit this activity. Moreover, AVAP I dramatically reduced the mRNA levels of CDK6 and Cyclin El but significantly increased Cyclin B1, CDK1 and Cyclin F. Interestingly, AVAP I remained able to induce cell proliferation in a low serum concentration medium. AVAP I could therefore promote HepG2 cell proliferation by regulating gene expression and accelerating the cell cycle process. AVAP I may be useful as a serum supplement for stimulating the proliferation of mammalian cells.

For example, the commercial cultivation of highly-prized abalone (Haliotidae: Vetigastropoda) has been hampered by naturally slow growth rates. To begin to investigate the molecular mechanisms controlling growth in haliotid molluscs, we chose to focus on neuropeptides secreted from anterior brain ganglia, because these have been implicated in controlling growth and reproduction in non-commercial gastropods. Here, we report the characterisation of three neuropeptides expressed in the anterior cerebral and pleuropedal ganglia of the tropical abalone Haliotis asinina; these are (1) the evolutionarily-conserved molluscan insulin-like peptide (Has-MIP), (2) a gastropod-specific schistosomin-like peptide (Has-SLP) and (3) a novel peptide currently known only from abalone, which we have called the haliotid growth-associated peptide (Has-HGAP). The novel Has-HGAP gene encodes a prepropeptide that undergoes substantial post-translational processing, including cleavage at an unusual site separating the two mature peptide chains of 19 and 51 amino acids in length; these are covalently bound by disulfide bonds. Quantitative comparison of Has-HGAP, Has-SLP and Has-MIP transcript abundance between the fastest and slowest growing individuals within a cohort of 6 month old cultured H. asinina reveals that Has-HGAP and Has-SLP are significantly upregulated in fast growing abalone; in contrast, Has-MIP is significantly downregulated. In light of their differential expression among juvenile abalone with markedly different growth rates, we suggest these neuropeptide genes will be fruitful points of focus for improving H. asinina growth rates in aquaculture by marker-assisted selective breeding.

One important question is whether OA will alter species interactions. Crustose coralline algae (CCA) provide space and chemical cues for larval settlement. CCA have shown strongly negative responses to OA in previous studies, including disruption of settlement cues to corals. In California, CCA provide cues for seven species of harvested, threatened, and endangered abalone. We exposed four common CCA genera and a crustose calcifying red algae, Peyssonnelia (collectively CCRA) from California to three pCO(2) levels ranging from 419-2,013 ae atm for four months. We then evaluated abalone (Haliotis rufescens) settlement under ambient conditions among the CCRA and non-algal controls that had been previously exposed to the pCO2 treatments. Abalone settlement and metamorphosis increased from 11% in the absence of CCRA to 45-69% when CCRA were present, with minor variation among CCRA genera. Though all CCRA genera reduced growth during exposure to increased pCO(2), abalone settlement was unaffected by prior CCRA exposure to increased pCO(2). Thus, we find no impacts of OA exposure history on CCRA provision of settlement cues. Additionally, there appears to be functional redundancy in genera of CCRA providing cues to abalone, which may further buffer OA effects.",10.1038/s41598-017-05502-x,"Micheli, Fiorenza/0000-0002-6865-1438; Potts, Donald/0000-0003-1271-1400",2045-2322,,,Jul-18,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-05502-x,28720836

These nutrients encourage primary productivity, forming the foundation of coastal food webs and the fisheries depending on them. Understanding past variability in the occurrence of upwelling and primary productivity may offer insight into how upwelling dynamics and ecosystem productivity could vary in the future. Numerous proxies from sediment cores inform most upwelling reconstructions; however, their temporal resolution is typically decadal at best. However, questions regarding ecosystem responses to changes in physical processes require data with seasonal to sub-seasonal resolution because such data provide additional insight into seasonal extremes (e.g., surface temperature, precipitation, etc.). The calcium carbonate skeletons of mollusks provide invaluable data from stable oxygen (delta O-18) and carbon (delta C-13) isotopes that generate high-resolution reconstructions of environmental variables. Recent studies of stable nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes in mollusk shell organic materials demonstrate the potential to produce high-resolution reconstructions of nutrient cycling. Collectively, these measurements may provide insight into upwelling conditions over the life of the organism. This study presents preliminary data exploring the potential of analyzing a suite of stable nitrogen, oxygen and carbon isotope data from analysis of Pacific abalone shells (Haliotis cracherodii). We present sub-seasonal delta N-15 time series data that, together with delta O-18 and delta C-13, reflect seasonal variability closely linked to upwelling. delta N-15 values range from 8.3 parts per thousand to 11.0 parts per thousand and align closely with delta O-18 values, which range from -0.5 parts per thousand to 1.1 parts per thousand. Implications of this research are twofold: 1) Isotopic analyses from abalone shells may provide detailed knowledge on primary productivity during upwelling as well as limited productivity when upwelling is greatly reduced and 2) archaeological shell middens in the Channel Islands contain an abundance of both abalone dating back to the early Holocene, presenting the opportunity to reconstruct upwelling conditions throughout the Holocene.",10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110342,"Bassett, Christine/0000-0002-4624-6757",0031-0182,1872-616X,,Jun-01,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110342,

Estimating such relationship is critical for informing the management and conservation of exploited species because it determines a natural population's response to exploitation. In the current study, recruitment rates of abalone Haliotis fulgens and Haliotis corrugata were recorded by means of postlarval collectors inside and outside 2 marine reserves in 2 subsequent years. At the same time and locations, theoretical reproductive outputs were computed by combining estimates of abalone densities and size structure with literature data on size-dependent fecundity and size at sexual maturity. We found that observed settlement rates correlated positively and significantly with estimated reproductive output, suggesting that greater production of eggs by large and fecund individuals can result in predictably high recruitment rates. In addition, the slope of the linear relationship suggests that the proportion of eggs that settle and metamorphose to become postlarvae is between 0.2% and 0.3%.

The concentrations of zeaxanthin and beta-carotene detected in the orange-muscle abalones were significantly higher than those detected in the common abalones (p < 0.01).

It is therefore economically desirable to maximize the conversion of feed protein into a valuable biomass, and environmentally desirable to minimize nitrogenous waste. Both ends can be achieved in algal-dependent integrated mariculture. Unlike fish-cage effluents, fishpond effluents can be treated. Use of marketable organisms as biofilters increases both diversification and income of the mariculture operation. Algal biofiltration has a stabilizing influence on water quality since, unlike bacteria, algae counteract the consumption of oxygen and the production Of CO2 by the fish. However, algal biofilters probably cost more to build and use a larger land area when compared with the alternative bacterial nitrification-denitrification aquaculture biofilter systems. Biofiltration by algae and shellfish, as has been developed as a part of integrated mariculture at the Israeli National Center for Mariculture, offsets the added cost by added sales of the biofilter organisms. This approach is based on algal sunlight-dependent assimilation of nutrients and their conversion into microalgal or macroalgal biomass. The algae are then consumed by algivore invertebrates such as bivalves, gastropods, and sea urchins. Sea urchins in particular can also be used to remove organic detritus. In the fish-phytoplankton-bivalve integrated culture system, bivalves filter microalgae that develop in fishponds and sedimentation ponds in which fishpond effluents collect. Such systems require large treatment areas relative to fish production, and are therefore suitable for extensive or semi-intensive fish culture with relatively low land costs. In fish-seaweed integrated culture, nutrients are removed from the fishpond effluents by green macroalgae such as Ulva lactuca. The macroalgae (seaweeds) can subsequently be fed to macroalgivores or processed for human consumption. While water from the fishponds passes through the macroalgae ponds, most of the ammonia (up to 90%,,) and significant fractions of other dissolved nutrients are removed from the water. The macroalgae improve the quality of the water by adding O-2 and removing excess CO2, thus making the water suitable for recirculation into the fishponds. The seaweed produced is excellent for feeding high-value macroalgivores such as abalone and sea urchins. Fish-seaweed integrated systems require less extensive land area than fish-phytoplankton-bivalve integrated systems and produce cleaner effluents. However, they may require larger inputs of capital and energy. Fish culture integrated with algal and shellfish biofilters has the potential to expand sustainably, meeting economic, environmental, and social concerns.",,,1571-3075,,978-1-4020-0884-9,,,

Pseudo-first order rate constants (K-for) in the forward (ATP forming) reaction direction showed maximal increases from basal values of 0.025 s(-1) to 0.095, 0.114, 0.126 s(-1) for NaN3 hypoxia, and PCP exposures, respectively. Increases in K-for were inversely correlated (r(2) = 1.00) to declines in ATP concentration in all exposed animals. Flux (the product of K-for, and phosphoarginine concentration) appeared to converge on a common value, from basal flux values of 0.257 mM PA s(-1) to 0.703, 0.770, and 0.627 mM PA s(-1) for NaN3, hypoxia, and PCP exposures, respectively. It seems likely that all three stresses were equally effective at inhibiting mitochondrial ATP formation, which may account for the similarity in flux increase, possibly to maximal rates of AK-mediated ATP formation. Differences in K-for, are related to declines in ATP concentrations, which appear to be stress specific, and likely indicate additional mechanisms of toxicity for NaN3 and PCP.

In South Africa, the recently introduced polychaete Boccardia proboscidea has been recorded at the outflow of abalone farms where they are known to infest the shells of these mollusks. To determine if B. proboscidea can become established along the South African coast and subsequently expand its range, we assessed brood size, larval size at hatching, larval survivorship and developmental time and rate of this species under temperature regimes reflective of those found along the coast. We also investigated similar temperature dependent development in the well-established non-indigenous shell borer Polydora hoplura which can serve as a proxy for our predictions. Worms were cultured in glass capillary tubes at five different temperature treatments (12 degrees C, 17 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 24 degrees C, 28 degrees C) and planktotrophic and adelphophagic larvae were tracked from oviposition to settlement. We found that in P. hoplura, females producing adelphophagic larvae had smaller broods at the highest temperature treatment and higher temperatures resulted in significantly larger sizes at hatching. Survivorship of planktotrophic and adelphophagic larvae was highest at the intermediate to high temperature treatments (21 degrees C and 24 degrees C) and was generally lower at the lower temperatures (12 degrees C and 17 degrees C). Temperature had no significant effect on brood size of B. pro boscidea whereas higher temperatures resulted in larger hatching sizes for planktotrophic and adelphophagic larvae. In B. proboscidea, larval types showed differences in survival optima with planktotrophic larvae exhibiting its highest survivorship at the colder temperatures and lowest at the warmer temperatures while adelphophagic larvae had its highest survivorship at 21 degrees C and its lowest at the extreme temperatures. There was a positive relationship between temperature and developmental rate for both species. The difference in larval sizes of the non-feeding planktotrophic larvae of B. proboscidea was attributed to a growth window that allowed for variability in reproductive traits based on exogenous factors such as temperature. More importantly, the results indicate that B. pro boscidea will be capable of producing viable populations at different localities along the South African coast including those where P. hoplura has already been established.

The macroalgae was cultured in various enriched media at a stocking density of 500 kg wet weight/pond. Overall, U. armoricana was able to remove a greater percentage of inorganic nitrogen in the double fertilizer ratio. The total dissolved phosphate was higher in standard seawater. U. armoricana showed preference for bioaccumulation, with ranges as follows: zinc (9.908 - 32.942 mg. kg(-1)); copper (1.893 - 5.927 mg. kg(-1)); cadmium (0.254 - 1.500 mg. kg(-1)); and lead (none detected). Apart from the presence of cadmium (Cd), the algal biomass produced at the end of the experiment was of a relatively good quality with limited heavy metal contamination so that U. armoricana could be successfully used as a plant stimulant but not as part of a feed formulation for livestock and for the food industry. This study showed that U. armoricana can effectively be used as a biological filter for dissolved nutrient uptake from aquaculture effluents.

The use of suspension-feeders (e.g. bivalves) in biofiltration systems provides an inexpensive option for the biological removal of these nutrients from effluent water. Land-based facilities are safer because the quality of the incoming water can be controlled, and integrated polyculture systems can save resources, diversify the product, allow intensification, and are environmentally friendly, thus offering a valid alternative to open sea monoculture. Several approaches have been developed to reach this goal. These approaches are based on the use of algae and invertebrates as biofilters, which remove the dissolved and particulate nutrients from fishpond effluents. Sunlight-dependent assimilation turns excess nutrients into microalgae biomass, which is then consumed with other organic particulate matter by the invertebrates. These systems consist of three units: a) a fish or shrimp culture unit, b) an earthen pond that serves as both a microalgal production and a bivalve culture unit, and c) a seaweed biofilter unit. Microalgae, especially benthic diatoms, are responsible for most of the nutrient uptake. The main cultured herbivores are filter-feeding bivalves, which grow in the earthen pond. The seaweed biofilter strips the remaining dissolved nutrients from the effluents. The harvested yields (fish, bivalve and seaweed) contain 63% of the nitrogen introduced into the system, particulate matter (faeces and uneaten feed) contain 33%, and suspended and dissolved outflow, approximately 4% of the nitrogen budget. More complex systems require highly skilled operators and more sophisticated technology, but they provide increased product diversity. Depending on practical factors such as market prices, quality and cost of labor, seed and fingerlings supply, environmental conditions, market size and property cost, the operational protocol can be shifted between the three product types (fish, algae and invertebrates) to maximize profits.",,,1568-1238,,1-4020-3028-2,,,

This research paper focuses on total iodine quantification in abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) and its components (viscera and muscle) using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Additionally, an in vitro bioavailability study explored iodine absorption potential. Abalone pretreatment involved both the European standard method (ES) and microwave-assisted extraction method (MAE). The limits of detection (LOD) were 0.11 ng/g for both ES and MAE, with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 5.4 ng/g for MAE. Accuracy, assessed using a reference material (fish muscle, ERM-BB422), showed values of 1.5 +/- 0.010 mg/kg for ES and 1.6 +/- 0.066 mg/kg for MAE, within an acceptable range of 1.4 +/- 0.42 mg/kg. Precision, evaluated using the Horwitz ratio (HorRat) with a reference material, was determined to be 0.45 for ES and 0.27 for MAE. Therefore, total iodine contents were estimated as 74 +/- 2.2 mu g/g for abalone viscera and 17 +/- 0.77 mu g/g for abalone muscle with ES, and 76 +/- 1.0 mu g/g for abalone viscera and 17 +/- 0.51 mu g/g for abalone muscle with MAE.

Genetic techniques may help to distinguish populations that are self-sustaining from those at risk of further decline, and demographic interdependence among subpopulations. We tested the use of genetic data for identifying stable and self-sustaining abalone populations, as well as the efficacy of a restoration technique for use in those populations that are not. We created an artificial aggregation of wild adult pink abalone (Haliotis corrugata) in the Point Loma kelp forest near San Diego, CA, USA. We genetically analyzed those individuals and additional adults and juveniles in the broader region. A self-sustained population should not be demographically reliant upon immigration. Temporal variability in relatedness among juvenile cohorts, and a lack of fine-scale spatial structure in adult and juvenile relatedness indicated complex recruitment dynamics and/or long distance larval delivery. We estimated a low effective population size (N-e = 188) and a very low ratio of effective population to census population size (N-e/N = 2.0 x 10(-3)). These data are consistent with sweepstakes reproductive success, and suggest that the population is at risk of genetic diversity decline. Parentage assignment revealed that none of the juveniles sampled one year after aggregating adults had parents from this aggregation. Collectively, our results suggest that restoration efforts will need to achieve a greater density (0.18 m(-2)) and/or number of individuals (46) to improve local recruitment.

Relative to the mainland and other Channel Islands, San Miguel Island (SMI) consistently maintains cooler water temperatures and supports significant populations of red abalone Haliotis rufescens, presumably owing to increased food production and diminished expression of the bacterial disease known as withering syndrome. We conducted a laboratory experiment to examine the effects of La Nina and El Nino conditions on the health and survival of red abalone from SMI.

By 4 days postfertilization the cerebral ganglion has five pairs of serotonin-immunoreactive (IR) neurons, one pair of which (the V cells) innervate the velum. This complement of cells remains stable for as long as the larval stage persists but metamorphosis causes the rapid loss of the V cells. In the case of SCP-IR neurons, one pair is present prior to metamorphic competency, but as larvae continue to age in the absence of inducing cues, additional pairs are gradually added.

Understanding how species respond to such changes, such as in their feeding interactions and physiology, is key to predicting their resilience to both seasonal and longer term climate changes. The Sitka Sound in Southeast Alaska, USA, is an attractive natural laboratory for studying change, as the marine environment experiences substantial seasonal fluctuations in parameters such as temperature, pH, and productivity between summer and winter. By sampling a suite of dominant macrophyte algae and their benthic herbivores in winter (January) and summer (July) 2019, we investigated how producers and their primary consumers may respond to seasonal change inferred through fatty acid trophic markers. We used a fatty acid logratio selection and analysis approach to ask the following: (1) Do fatty acid biomarkers for algae differ between seasons? (2) Do the same fatty acid biomarkers differ between seasons when applied to herbivores, with herbivore fatty acids tracking the presumed trophic resources? (3) Do fatty acid biomarkers for herbivores differ between seasons, when considered independently from algae? Comparing logratio sets selected each for the algae and the herbivore fatty acids, we found that algae fatty acids were different between our sampling seasons, but the algae-selected fatty acid logratios did not clearly separate most herbivores by season. In contrast, the herbivore-selected logratios strongly distinguished herbivore species between the January and June samplings. Further, dispersions of fatty acid logratios were greater within herbivore species in the winter than in the summer, potentially due to the utilization of more diverse resources when preferred algae are less abundant. In total, results suggest that herbivores are not simply tracking the seasonal fatty acid changes in the dominant algae as trophic resources; instead, herbivore fatty acid seasonal changes may occur largely through some other nonexclusive mechanisms, such as omnivory, reductions or shifts in dietary composition, and/or endogenous physiological responses. Thus, the benthic herbivores in our study appear not to be locked into their diets when faced with seasonal change and may use a range of strategies, including diet diversification, to cope with environmental variation.",10.1002/ecs2.70135,"Schram, Julie/0000-0002-1556-6483; Galloway, Aaron/0000-0001-7826-299X; Bell, Lauren/0000-0002-4344-4280; Kroeker, Kristy/0000-0002-5766-1999",2150-8925,,,JAN,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.70135,

The first creates a new binding site for transcription factor SP1. An enhancing effect of the g.112G variant on the expression was demonstrated by 3 independent pGL3 gene reporter assays. The latter is responsible for the p.78Ile>Val AA replacement and represents novel allelic variants (named LALBA A and B). A link to protein variants has been established by isoelectric focusing (IEF), and bioinformatics analysis revealed that carriers of valine (g.1229G) have a higher glycosylation rate. Genotyping methods based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) were set up for both SNPs. Overall, adenine was more frequent (0.54 and 0.76) at both loci. Four haplotypes were found, and the AA and GA were the most common with a frequency of 0.403 and 0.365, respectively. Conversely, a putative biological gain characterizes the haplotype GG. Therefore, opportunities for rapid directional selection can be realized if this haplotype is associated with favorable milk protein properties. This study adds knowledge at the gene and protein level for alpha-LA (LALBA) in camelids and importantly contributes to a relatively unexplored research area in these species.",10.3168/jds.2023-23813,"Pauciullo, Alfredo/0000-0002-3140-9373",0022-0302,1525-3198,,FEB,http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2023-23813,38122895

Recently, a homologue of Rel\NF-kappa B transcription factor was identified from a gastropod abalone, Haliotis diversicolor supertexta, named Ab-Rel. We present here a new strategy, so called magnetocapture, based on magnetic separation that was developed to isolate and detect this abalone transcriptional factor. With this method, Ab-Rel was successfully isolated from abalone haemocytes and the recombinant Ab-Rel protein from an insect cell line. Western blot analysis was performed to verify the effectiveness of this magnetocapture assay. Since only the activated NF-kappa B can be captured and separated from the whole cell extracts, this method was simultaneously used to detect the NF-kappa B activity in vivo, as well as the biological activity of the recombinant protein in vitro. In addition, several proteins which might interact with the abalone NF kappa B were together isolated, suggesting that the magnetocapture method would be useful for identifying interaction molecules. These results illustrated that the magnetocapture strategy is rapid, reliable and versatile, providing a promising tool for studying Rel\NF-kappa B protein.

Increased mortality since 1999 was focused inshore of a southeast trending line extending from approximately the Delaware Bay mouth to the central continental shelf off the mouth of Chesapeake Bay. To investigate further the proximate causes of mortality, we carried out a histopathological survey of surf clams collected along this southeast-trending mortality line. The most northern stations had the highest condition indices, the lowest gonadal abnormality scores, with one exception, and the lowest digestive gland atrophy scores. Animals at the stations with lowest average condition index had body weights less than 65% of the average animal taken at the station with the highest condition index. A syndrome describing a malnourished state common in clams taken along the mortality line emerged from this analysis. Animals with low condition were also animals with higher scores of gonadal abnormality and higher scores of digestive gland atrophy. Neither parasites, nematodes and cestodes, occurred commonly, nor instances of hemocyte infiltration, also common, were significantly correlated with low condition index and the associated tissue disorders indicative of malnutrition. Nematodes and the frequently associated instances of focal infiltration by hemocytes were not obviously more common in the southern stations where condition index was low. Cestodes tended to occur more frequently at sites where condition index was low, but infection intensity was high at some stations not so characterized. No disease-causing organisms were observed in this study. Starvation, brought on by regional shifts in temperature mismatching food supply and feeding rate with tissue maintenance needs, offers one potential mechanism explaining the distribution of apparently malnourished clams and the origin of the increase in mortality inshore of the mortality line.",,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,AUG,,

The dynamics, processes, environment and management of semi-intensive (several tons ha(-1)y(-1)) mariculture IMTA started in the early 1970s, at the National Center for Mariculture (NCM) in Eilat, with several models that combined flow-through and recirculation features between primary (fed) and secondary (extractive) species. The seawater fishponds differed from freshwater ponds mainly in the continuous exchange with water from the open sea, to stabilize salinity and other water quality features. The primary (fed) fish was mostly the seabream (Spares aurata), seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), shrimp (Penaeus semisulcatus) and mullets (Mugil cephalus and Liza ramada). At first, the extractive component included microalgae, oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and clams (Ruditapes philippnmarum). In more progressive models, plastic-lined double drain ponds and tanks are used. Several other species, for example: clams, seaweed (the macroalgae Ulva spp. and Gracilaria spp.), abalone (Haliotis tuberculata and H. discus hannai), sea urchins (Paracentrotus lividus and Tripneustes gratilla elatensis), shrimp, brine shrimp (Anemia salMa) are used. Wetlands planted with the halophytes Salicornia sp. and Sarcocrnia sp. have been integrated as IMTA. Recently, periphyton and drip-irrigated algal biofilters were examined and found to be practical. The research contributed to the enhancement of the sustainability, flexibility and potential for profitability of the aquaculture operation, based on the accumulated understanding about the functioning of the different units and the interactions between them.

The aim of this study was to analyze inter-annual variation in recruitment, mortality, total and vulnerable biomass, selectivity, and harvest rate of Haliotis fulgens. A size-structured model was used to assess changes in the population dynamics and management quantities from 2010 to 2019. The model describes the exploitation and growth of individuals in the population, and incorporates a stochastic growth matrix that defines the variation in the length increments of individual to individual. Key results indicated that the recruitment failures occurred in infrequent pulses of varying intensity. Moreover, a slight recovery of total biomass during 2017 (791 t), 2018 (1496 t), and 2019 (1274 t) was observed after a slight increase in recruitment and a decrease in harvest rate. The vulnerable biomass increased 44.38% from 2010 to 2019. The harvest rate revealed that individuals larger than the minimum legal size of 145 mm were under high fishing pressure. The stock assessment model highlights an adverse effect in the population; given the deteriorating conditions of the green abalone fishery, it is imperative to transition fully to a recovery strategy, including all the administrative zones in the assessment and management.

WS-RLP infection is not sufficient to cause withering syndrome, and for reasons not yet well understood additional stressors such as elevated water temperature appear to influence disease development. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based metabolomics, we have investigated the influence of food availability, temperature, and bacterial infection, both individually and in combination, on the metabolic status of the red abalone. Food limitation caused dramatic reductions in all observed classes of foot muscle metabolites, while at the same time metabolite levels within the digestive gland were preserved or increased. We also found that food limitation in combination with elevated temperature led to greater metabolic perturbations in both tissue types than those observed under food limitation alone. WS-RLP infection and food-limitation resulted in many of the same metabolic changes within the tissues studied, although the effects of infection were less severe. We observed increased levels of homarine in the digestive gland of both food-limited and WS-RLP-infected animals, yet only observed increased homarine levels in the foot muscle of infected abalone. These results further support the recently established glucose-to-homarine ratio in foot muscle as a potential marker for differentiating WS-RLP-infected animals from those of both healthy and food limited abalone.

Ocean temperatures are rising which triggers massive changes in water chemistry and thereby alters the living environment of all marine organisms. Studying adaptation, however, can be tricky because spatial genetic patterns might also occur due to random effects, for example, genetic drift. Genetic drift is reduced in very large and well-connected populations, such as in broadcast marine spawning organisms. Here, spatial genetic divergence is likely to be produced by selection. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Sandoval-Castillo etal. (2018) investigated patterns of spatial genetic divergence and their association with environmental factors in the greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata). This commercially important species of mollusc is a broadcast spawner with large population sizes, rendering genetic drift an unlikely factor in the genetic divergence of wild populations. Sandoval-Castillo etal. (2018) used a ddRAD genomic approach to test for genetic divergence between sampled populations while also measuring different environmental factors, for example, water temperature and oxygen content. The majority of identified SNPs was putatively neutral and showed only low levels of genetic divergence between field sites. However, 323 candidate adaptive markers were identified that clearly separated the individuals into five different clusters. These genetic clusters correlated with environmental clusters mainly determined by water temperature and (correlated) oxygen concentration. Gene annotation of the candidate SNPs revealed a large proportion of loci being involved in biological processes influenced by oxygen availability. The study by Sandoval-Castillo etal. (2018) in this issue of Molecular Ecology exemplifies the benefits of combining genomic studies with ecological data. It is a great starting point for more detailed (gene function, physiology) as well as broader (biodiversity) investigations that might help us to better understand adaptation and predict ecosystems' resilience and resistance to environmental disturbances.

Embryos and larvae of the sea urchin Lytechinus pictus (Verrill) were used to test hypotheses regarding differential costs of protein synthesis in animals differing in size, rates of protein synthesis, and physiological feeding states. For embryos, the rate of protein synthesis was 0.22 +/- 0.014 ng protein embryo(-1) h(-1) (mean +/- s.e.m.) and decreased in unfed larvae to an average rate of 0.05 +/- 0.001 ng protein larva(-1) h(-1). Fed larvae had rates of synthesis that were up to 194 times faster than unfed larvae (9.7 +/- 0.81 ng protein larva(-1) h(-1)). There was no significant difference, however, in the cost of protein synthesis between these larvae with very different physiological states. Furthermore, the cost of synthesis in the larval stages was also similar to costs measured for blastula and gastrula embryos of 8.4 +/- 0.99 J mg(-1) protein synthesized. The cost of protein synthesis was obtained using both direct ('inhibitor') and indirect ('correlative') measurements; both methods gave essentially identical results. Protein synthesis accounted for up to 54 +/- 8% of metabolic rate in embryos. Percent of metabolism accounted for by protein synthesis in larvae was dependent on their physiological feeding state, with protein synthesis accounting for 16 +/- 4% in unfed larvae and 75 +/- 11% in fed larvae. This regulation of metabolic rate was due to differential rates of synthesis for a fixed energy cost per unit mass of protein synthesized. The cost of synthesizing a unit of protein did not change with increasing rates of protein synthesis. We conclude that the cost of protein synthesis is independent of the rate of synthesis, developmental stage, size and physiological feeding state during sea urchin development.",10.1242/jeb.01962,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,JAN,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.01962,16354787

These showed that both species occupy primarily hard substrate, showing preferences for encrusting coralline algae. They also confirmed a strong. positive relationship between urchins and juvenile abalone. Of the juvenile abalone sampled, more than 98% were found beneath sea urchins. All small(3-10 mm) and medium-sired (11-20 mm) juvenile abalone were under urchins, whether on flat or vertical reef, or in crevices. A small proportion (similar to 10%) of larger juveniles (21-35 mm) was not found under urchins, and in these instances they occupied crevices instead. These findings are of particular importance in terms of their implications for the lucrative commercial abalone fishery in South Africa, indicating that urchins are of critical importance to the continued survival of viable abalone populations. There has been a dramatic decrease in natural populations of sea urchins over the past five years in the heart of the abalone fishing grounds, and the present findings suggest that this will lead to recruitment failure of abalone. because juvenile abalone seem dependent on the urchins.

However, maternal nutritional deficiencies driven by alimentary restrictions would expectedly impact pinniped development and fitness, as an adequate supply of nutrients is essential for growth and proper functioning of all body systems, including red blood cell synthesis and clearance. Here, we investigated red blood cell morphology of California sea lion (CSL) pups from the San Benito Archipelago born during the 2014 and 2015 anomalously high SST events recorded in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. We examined whether atypical erythrocyte morphologies were more common in 2015, when the high SST event was more pronounced, and whether the stable isotope signature of pup fur, as an indicator of maternal feeding strategies, accounted for the number of atypical cells. Various atypical erythrocyte morphologies were more prevalent and more abundant than reference values. Evidence of iron deficiency was found in both years, and only pups born in 2014 showed evidence of active erythropoiesis. Microcytes and reticulocytes were more common in pups with higher isotopic delta C-13 and lower delta N-15 values, suggesting a probable relationship between maternal feeding strategies and the effect of climatic anomalies on red blood cell physiology of their pups. As developing pinnipeds require increased oxygen storage capacity for diving and foraging, the presence of atypical erythrocytes could be relevant to CSL pup fitness if the underlying cause is not reverted.

Their decline is a loss for indigenous tribes, recreational divers, and the health of subtidal rocky reefs and kelp beds. Current restoration actions are facing threats of ocean acidification and warming in the northeast Pacific. This research aims to deepen our understanding of the tolerance and physiological flexibility of early life history stages of pinto abalone and inform hatchery practices under future climate change scenarios. We conducted an experiment to test how seawater pH and temperature stress impact abalone larvae. We exposed abalone post-fertilization to elevated temperature and reduced seawater pH for ten days spanning their larval development period: (1) 7.95pH/14 degrees C (ambient), (2) 7.60pH/14 degrees C, (3) 7.95pH/18 degrees C, and (4) 7.60pH/18 degrees C. Abalone in the ambient treatment had the best survival, those in the 7.60pH/18 degrees C treatment had the worst survival, and those in the two single-stressor treatments had survival in between. Among the surviving larvae, pH was the dominant stressor influencing settlement success, with higher settlement rates under ambient pH treatments at both temperatures. pH also had a stronger effect than temperature on shell length.

A promising mitigation strategy is the identification and breeding of shellfish varieties exhibiting resilience to acidification stress. We experimentally compared the effects of OA on two populations of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens), a marine mollusc important to fisheries and global aquaculture. Results from our experiments simulating captive aquaculture conditions demonstrated that abalone sourced from a strong upwelling region were tolerant of ongoing OA, whereas a captive-raised population sourced from a region of weaker upwelling exhibited significant mortality and vulnerability to OA. This difference was linked to population-specific variation in the maternal provisioning of lipids to offspring, with a positive correlation between lipid concentrations and survival under OA. This relationship also persisted in experiments on second-generation animals, and larval lipid consumption rates varied among paternal crosses, which is consistent with the presence of genetic variation for physiological traits relevant for OA survival. Across experimental trials, growth rates differed among family lineages, and the highest mortality under OA occurred in the fastest growing crosses.

This study deals with the possibility of using nacre fragments obtained from abalone shell for making a bulletproof armor system. A composite plate laminated with abalone shell fragments is made and compression and bend tests are carried out. In addition, a bulletproof test is performed with hybrid armor systems which are composed of an alumina plate, a composite plate, and aramid woven fabric to verify the ballistic performance of nacre. The compressive strength of the composite plate is around 258.3 MPa. The bend strength and modulus of the composite plate decrease according to the plate thickness and are about 149.2 MPa and 50.3 GPa, respectively, for a 4.85 mm thick plate.

In this study, three RNA isolation methods were tested to evaluate their usefulness in RNA isolation from various abalone tissues. Unlike the conventional method (method I), methods II and III included additional centrifugation and lithium chloride precipitation steps, respectively. RNA quality assessment based on the RT-PCR amplification of ribosomal protein L3 (RPL3) showed little difference in the quality of RNA isolated from muscle, regardless of the isolation method used. While RNA isolated from the hepatopancreas using methods I and II resulted in lower levels of RPL3 amplification, method III was found to be a more effective method of RNA extraction from the hepatopancreas, as indicated by a 30-60-fold increase in the RPL3 level. Competitive inhibition experiments using mixtures of RNA prepared by each method were performed to investigate which RT-PCR step was inhibited by materials present in the RNA preparation. An almost complete absence of RPL3 amplification was observed in RT-PCR with a cDNA template prepared from a mixture of RNAs containing a small amount of hepatopancreatic RNA isolated using method I. A drastic decrease in the incorporation of a fluorescence-labeled nucleotide into cDNA was also evident in the reverse transcription containing hepatopancreatic RNA isolated using method I. These results indicate a distinct inhibition of cDNA synthesis by materials present in the hepatopancreatic RNA preparation isolated using method I, but not present when method III is used. A competitive inhibition experiment was performed using mixtures of cDNA prepared from RNA isolated by each method to investigate whether the materials used in the preparation inhibited the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) step. The level of RPL3 amplification was proportional to the amount of cDNA prepared from hepatopancreatic RNA isolated using method III. The comparable degree of amplification regardless of the amount of cDNA prepared from RNA isolated using method I, together with the low cDNA synthesis in the latter, indicated that it had little, if any, inhibitory effect on the PCR step.

The AVH by Alcalase showed promising ORAC value, and further optimal enzyme/substrate hydrolysis condition for production of the AVH was determined. The AVH also exerted strong hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity, Fe2+ chelating activity, and reducing power. Furthermore, the AVH inhibited lipid peroxidation in a model system and protected hydroxyl radical-induced DNA damage. Amino acid profiles revealed that the AVH contained 57.1% antioxidant amino acids and 44.0% hydrophobic amino acids, which contributed to its higher antioxidant activity. In addition, the AVH showed cytoprotective effects against hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity of cultured hepatocytes, and significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and membrane lipid peroxidation.

Beginning in the early 1980s, commercial scale mariculture of abalone has involved 2 species: Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai Ino and the small tropical abalone, H. diversicolor Reeve. Intensive culture of H. d. hannai is distributed mainly in the northern China region, Liaoning and Shandong Provinces with an annual production increasing from about 47 nit (1992) to 4500 nit (2003). The small tropical abalone is the dominant species with a total production of H. diversicolor reaching 3878 mt produced in 2001 in Fujian. Guangdong and Hainan Provinces. Seeds for cultivation are exclusively produced from hatcheries with well-developed technology. Cultivation practices may vary widely among different sea types. Three major forms of grow-out are used in abalone cultivation, land-based tanks, suspended longline cages and intertidal ponds. Abnormal mortality has threatened sustainable development of the abalone industry from its inception. During 1992 to 1996, many facilities in the north ran at a loss due to mass mortality occurring in juveniles and seeds. Mortality usually occurred in the postsettlement nursery phase when spat remain on settlement plates, characterized by cease of dietary intake and falling from the substratum. The cause of this large-scale mortality remains as yet unknown. The same Situation occurred in Fujian front 1996, after 2 y of large-scale farming, and has already spread to all other provinces of abalone mariculture. Genetic improvement of abalone has drawn much attention. Hybridization between different populations from Japan and China has been achieved to obtain significant heterosis with growth and survival.

Various studies have suggested that this urchin outcompetes black-lipped abalone (Haliotis rubra) for resources, but experiments elucidating the mechanisms are lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings: We outline a new framework involving experimental manipulations and Markov chain and Pareto modelling to examine the effects of interspecific competition between urchins and abalone and the effect of intraspecific competition in abalone, assessed as effects on behaviour. Manipulations of abalone densities had no detectable effect on urchin behavioural transitions, movement patterns or resightability through time. In contrast, additions of urchins resulted in abalone shifting microhabitats from exposed to sheltered positions, an increase in the proportion of mobile abalone, and declines in abalone resightability through time relative to controls without the urchins. Our results support the hypothesis of asymmetrical competitive interactions between urchins and abalone. Conclusions/Significance: The introduction of urchins to intact algal beds causes abalone to flee and seek shelter in cryptic microhabitat which will negatively impact both their accessibility to such microhabitats, and productivity of the abalone fishery, and will potentially affect their growth and survival, while the presence of the abalone has no detectable effect on the urchin.

Several criteria were used to examine whether they may be applied as snail-specific for the screening of the presumptive probiotic bacterial strains. Principal Component Analysis using criteria such as the tolerance of these strains to the pedal mucus, gastric mucus, gastric juices and low pH, as well as the expression of the cell surface traits of hydrophobicity, biofilm formation and autoaggregation capacity revealed discrimination of twelve strains exhibiting presumptive in vitro probiotic properties. Injection of eight of these strains, which were identified as Lactobacillus plaraarum, in snail haemocoel increased the recruitment and phagocytic activity of amoebocytes in snail haemolymph.

These results suggest that both water temperature and nutritional conditions influence the frequency of fission in C. acutispina.",,,0007-9723,2262-3094,,,,

Use of beach-cast Laminaria pallida is limited, although it comprises the bulk of the biomass on the northern West Coast. Ecklonia maxima dominates the southern West Coast and provides most of the material for the South African kelp industry. Harvests of E. maxima fronds for abalone feed have reached 3 000 -5 000 tonnes fresh weight (t f wt) y(-1), whereas beach-cast material of both species (about 1 000t dry wt y(-1)) is collected mainly for alginate extraction. For the first time, a South African kelp inventory has been compiled using all available data for the 900km-long West Coast (Cape Agulhas to the Orange River), although a few gaps remain. Beds of E. maxima and L. pallida reaching the surface at low spring tides were mapped using one or several methods: infrared aerial photography, digital multispectral aerial imagery, Landsat satellite imagery, and physical mapping with a hand-held GPS. The data are on a GIS database. Landsat 5 TM imagery could identify the presence of kelp beds, but only infrared aerial imagery and multispectral imaging at low spring tides accurately quantified surface areas of kelp beds. Biomass of the main kelp (E. maxima) is variable in space (between 3kg f wt m(-2) and 24kg f wt m(-2)) and time (changes of up to 50%), making estimates for management difficult. Using an average biomass value of 12kg m(-2), the total biomass of surface-reaching kelp beds on the West Coast is estimated to exceed 593 000t f wt, but extensive subsurface beds remain unquantified.

Taurine, an essential amino acid component, has yet to be well investigated for its seasonal variation and genetically associated genes or loci in Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai). In this study, we investigated the variation of taurine content in different seasons under two typical culturing systems in southern China. In addition, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 274 abalone array sequencing and phenotypic data of taurine content. The results revealed that the taurine content showed a trend of significantly decreasing and then increasing with seasonal changes. Individuals farmed in land-based industrial culture system had a greater taurine content than those farmed in sea-based floating raft culture system, with notable differences observed between May and September. A total of 69,530 high-quality SNPs and 274 individuals were identified by quality control. And 32 significantly related SNP loci of taurine content were identified by GWAS, with chromosome 9 hosting the lowest P value. A total of 33 candidate genes, including SLC6A7, EGF1, B3gnt6, and Ptpra, were annotated. These genes may be connected to amino acid synthesis, transmembrane transport, energy production, protein phosphorylation, and other processes. Among them, genes belonging to the SLC6A family may be the key gene taurine content.

Its high economic value and vulnerability to exploitation has triggered the interest in the development of its aquaculture. Significant progress has been made in recent years, with the establishment of artificial fertilization and larval production protocols. However, there are at least two major challenges that need to be addressed before a commercial production can be achieved: larval settlement and juvenile grow-out. The aim of this research was to study the effect of different algae substrates (Ulvella lens, Amphora sp., Entomoneis sp., Navicula salinicola and Nitzschia sp.) on P. aspera settlement and to test the effect of two diets on juvenile growth: a mono diet based on U. lens versus a mixed diet composed by U. lens and the diatoms Nitzschia sp. and Navicula salinicola. Results showed that U. lens was the most efficient settlement cue, given that 84.6% of the post-larvae obtained were found on this algae substrate. In the following trial, U. lens was selected as the base diet for the grow-out phase. The rearing system used ensured juvenile survival percentages above 80%. The regular supply of the diatom mixture, as a dietary supplement, significantly enhanced juvenile growth performance. After 220 days post fertilization, limpets that grew on the mixed diet (U. lens plus diatoms) presented an average shell length of 19.280 +/- 5.296 mm. Additionally, developed gonads were observed in females with less than 8 months. This study presents the first record of P. aspera juvenile grow-out, born from artificial fertilization, which represents a major step toward the development of limpet aquaculture.",10.1016/j.aqrep.2023.101906,,2352-5134,,,FEB,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2023.101906,

We evaluated the relationships between shell length (SL), shell width (SW) and body weight (BW, the total wet weight) in two different strains of Pacific abalone. One strain is 'Huangxun No. 1', which is from the fifth generation of a novel strain that has experienced higher shell growth rate selection, and the other strain is a first-generation descendant of wild Pacific abalone. The results of the correlation analysis showed that both SL and SW were significantly (p < 0.05) positively correlated with BW in both strains. Path analysis showed that SL significantly affected the BW of the 'Huangxun No. 1' strain, while SW significantly affected BW at only one of the four ages tested. Both SL and SW significantly affected the BW of the wild strain at the four ages tested. The determination coefficients of SL on BW in the 'Huangxun No. 1' strain at 3, 6, 13 and 19 months of age were 0.835, 0.141, 0.834 and 0.708, respectively, while those in the wild strain were 0.476, 0.237, 0.344 and 0.141, respectively. In addition, the SL/SW in the 'Huangxun No. 1' strain ranged from 1.453 to 1.509, while that of the wild-type strain ranged from 1.389 to 1.497. The allometric growth analyses showed positive allometric growth for 'Huangxun No. 1' from 3 to 19 months of age, while the wild strain did not show such growth. These results suggest that multiple generations of selection for a higher SL growth rate may have led to variation in shell morphological traits and that shell width may be a less important factor in determining body weight in the 'Huangxun No. 1' strain, while shell length can be used as an effective morphological trait for selective breeding to increase body weight.",10.1007/s10499-023-01281-7,,0967-6120,1573-143X,,JUN,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-023-01281-7,

Here, we report the generation of DNA sequence data from mollusc shells using such techniques, applied to Haliotis virginea Gmelin, 1791, a New Zealand abalone, in which morphological variation has led to the recognition of several forms and subspecies. We successfully recovered near-complete mitogenomes from 22 specimens including 12 dry-preserved shells up to 60 years old. We used a combination of palaeogenetic techniques that have not previously been applied to shell, including DNA extraction optimized for ultra-short fragments and hybridization-capture of single-stranded DNA libraries. Phylogenetic analyses revealed three major, well-supported clades comprising samples from: (1) The Three Kings Islands; (2) the Auckland, Chatham and Antipodes Islands; and (3) mainland New Zealand and Campbell Island.

In this study, after four months of culturing under blue light (NB), orange light (NY), dark environment (ND), and natural light (NN), the shell length and weight-specific growth rate in Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai, were ranked in the following order: NY > NN > ND > NB. To understand the growth differences in abalone under these different light en-vironments, we first performed 24-h video monitoring and found that the cumulative movement distance and duration were lowest in group NB, whereas the cumulative movement distance and duration were significantly higher in group ND than in any other group (P < 0.05). In group NB, the time spent hidden underneath the attachment substrate accounted for 81% of the resting time, but this ratio was lowest in group ND, at only 37% (P < 0.05). Next, LC-MS metabolomics identified 201 and 105 metabolites in NB vs. NN, ND vs. NN, and NY vs. NN under the positive and negative ion modes, respectively. According to the fold changes and annotations for differential metabolites in the KEGG enrichment pathways, adenosine, NAD+, cGMP, and arachidonic acid were used as differential metabolism markers, and the AMPK signaling pathway was enriched in every comparison group, and thus investigated further. The gene sequences of three subtypes of AMPK were obtained by cloning and we found that the expression levels of AMPK alpha and AMPK gamma, and the AMP content were significantly higher in group NB than in any other group (P < 0.05). In addition, the ATP contents and adenylate energy charge values were ranked in the following order: NY > NN > ND > NB. According to in situ hybridization analysis, the three subtype genes were widely expressed in the hepatopancreas. Finally, the contents of many lipid metabolites differed significantly among groups and the expression levels of the triglyceride hydrolysis-related gene hormone sensitive lipase and fatty acid oxidation-related gene carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 were higher in groups ND and NB than in groups NN and NY according to fluorescence quantification PCR (P < 0.05). The expression levels of fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase were significantly lower in groups ND and NB than in groups NN and NY (P < 0.05).

Field and laboratory studies have shown that the tropical species Haliotis asinina undergoes a two-week spawning cycle, thus providing an excellent opportunity to investigate the presence of endogenous spawning-associated peptides. In female H. asinina, we have isolated a peptide (5145Da) whose relative abundance in hemolymph increases substantially just prior to spawning and is still detected using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography chromatograms up to 1-day post-spawn. We have isolated this peptide from female hemolymph as well as samples prepared from the gravid female gonad, and demonstrated through comparative sequence analysis that it contains features characteristic of Kazal-type proteinase inhibitors (KPIs). Has-KPI is expressed specifically within the gonad of adult females. A recombinant Has-KPI was generated using a yeast expression system. The recombinant Has-KPI does not induce premature spawning of female H. asinina when administered intramuscularly. However it displays homomeric aggregations and interaction with at least one mollusc-type neuropeptide (LRDFVamide), suggesting a role for it in regulating neuropeptide endocrine communication. This research provides new understanding of a peptide that can regulate reproductive processes in female abalone, which has the potential to lead to the development of greater control over abalone spawning. The findings also highlight the need to further explore abalone reproduction to clearly define a role for novel spawning-associated peptide in sexual maturation and spawning.

The analysis showed that the CsTRx polypeptide contains a thioredoxin domain between Val(2) and Asn(106). The domain possessed a thioredoxin active family at 24-42 along with a redox active site (also known as catalytic center) at (31)WCGPC(35). The analysis showed that the catalytic center is responsible for the control of protein function. Phylogenetic study showed that CsTRx clustered together with vertebrate TRx-1. Based on the phylogenetic analysis and other bioinformatics analysis, it is confirmed that the characterized CsTRx belongs to TRx-1 family. In addition, the sub-cellular localization prediction analysis showed that CsTRx is a cytosol thioredoxin. The highest gene expression was observed in gill (P < 0.05). Further, its transcriptional modulation was evaluated under fungal (Aphanomyces invadans), bacterial (Aeromonas hydrophila) and H2O2 challenges. The recombinant CsTRx protein was over-expressed and purified using an Escherichia coli expression vector system. We conducted a H2O2 peroxidase assay using recombinant CsTRx protein under various pH and temperature. Further, we studied the influence of recombinant CsTRx protein on C striatus spleen leukocyte activation. The recombinant CsTRx protein enhanced the cell proliferation in a concentration dependant manner. The results of antioxidant analysis showed that the antioxidant capacity of recombinant CsTRx protein was determined to be 4.2 U/mg protein. We conducted an insulin disulfides assay to study the enzymatic oxidoreductase activity of CsTRx and we observed no activity in the control group. But the recombinant CsTRx protein addition rapidly increased the enzymatic oxidoreductase activity. Over all, the results showed that the CsTRx may contain potential antioxidant properties, which could regulate the oxidative stress created by various biological pathogens as well as chemical stress in the immune system of C striatus, thus protecting it.

However, its production relies completely on hatchery-reared seed, and the survival in early stages, particularly during the settling process, is the main limitation for this activity to become cost effective. Thus, in order to assess the feasibility of improving survival of larvae and post-larvae of A. nucleus through genetic selection without affecting growth, it was estimated the heritability and the genotype-environment interactions for such traits, as well as the genetic correlations between them. These parameters were estimated based on intraclass correlations of 40 full-sib families (10 half-sib families) at 1, 11 and 75 days post fertilization. Heritability values were very high for the post-larvae survival (0.49), while it was low and not significant for larvae survival (<= 0.07) and medium to high for growth traits of larvae and post-larvae (> 0.3). The traits analyzed in post-larvae exhibited significant genotype-environment interactions in relation to culture depth in the sea. No significant genetic correlations between the measured traits were found. The results suggest the existence of an important genetic component in the variation of post-larval survival, and larval and post-larval growth, as well as a high potential response to direct genetic selection, especially for post-larval survival (50% increase per generation), without affecting the growth traits.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.06.047,,0044-8486,1873-5622,,Oct-01,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.06.047,
"DIXON, FJ; JACOTGUI.H; MCCONAHEY, PJ",EFFECT OF PASSIVELY ADMINISTERED ANTIBODY ON ANTIBODY SYNTHESIS,1967,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE,125,6,1119,+,,"Suppression of the primary response of rabbits to intravenously ad-ministered KLH [keyhole limpet hemocyanin] can be achieved with very small amounts of hyperimmune anti KLH administered a day later since the rabbit apparently rapidly eliminates most of the KLH by non-immunologic means. The amount of passive anti KLH needed to achieve immunosuppression was directly proportional to the dose of injected antigen. Antibody passively administered as much as 6-8 days after antigen still can be strongly immunosuppressive, suggesting that the antibody must be reacting with immunogen in or on responding cells or perhaps in the process of transfer between cells. There was no evidence that the presence of passively admin-istered hyperimmune anti KLH prior to the injection of antigen had any immunosuppressive action beyond the direct neutralization of the injected antigen. When KLH was injected in Freund''s adjuvant, anti KLH incorporated with the KLH in the adjuvant was much more efficient in causing immunosuppression than was anti KLH given intravenously. The primary responses to 2 mg KLH given intraven-ously and 2 [mu]g given in adjuvant reached approximately equal peaks and were suppressible by comparable amounts of intravenously administered anti KLH. Two observations suggest that passive anti-body neutralizes the immunogenic stimulus at the level of individual antigenic determinants and not merely by aggregating or precipitating entire antigenic molecules. First, anti abalone hemocyanin (AH) which cross reacts approximately 50% with KLH was only partially immunosuppressive even in extremely large amounts, i.e., amounts which could react with and precipitate much more KLH than could the smaller but more suppressive doses of anti KLH. Second, when KLH and anti KLH were given together in adjuvant effective immuno-suppression was achieved only with amounts of anti KLH sufficient to saturate or cover virtually all available antigenic determinants. The immunosuppressive quality of passive antibody increases with time after immunization and with repeated immunization of the donor. In view of their relatively weak immunosuppressive properties, antibodies formed in the 1st weeks of a primary response may not contribute significantly to the turning off of the antibody response. In any event, results obtained by passive transfer of hyperimmune antibody to animals early in a primary response cannot be applied to the natural events in a primary response.",10.1084/jem.125.6.1119,,0022-1007,1540-9538,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1084/jem.125.6.1119,6025320

In present study, various settlement and metamorphosis inducers at both the laboratory and scale-up experiments were investigated to determine their effects in inducing settlement and metamorphosis on the abalone Haliotis diversicolor supertexta. In lab experiment, results showed that both bacteria and diatoms colonized on the substrata could greatly enhance the larval settlement and metamorphosis, and larval settlement and metamorphosis could be induced by exposure to natural seawater supplemented with potassium chloride (KCl), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or KCl combined with GABA. Treatments supplemented with 5 mM KCl, 10 mM KCl, 10(-6) M GABA or some combinations can significantly enhance both the settlement and metamorphosis rates. And lower settlement and metamorphosis were induced by higher concentration up to 20 mM KCl or 5 x 10-6 M GABA, which indicated that high concentrations of KCl or GABA were toxic to abalone larvae. The combination of KCl and GABA did not appear positive synergy effects than that of single supplementation. Time course experiment demonstrated that supplementing time was critical to the stimulatory effects on larval settlement and metamorphosis. In scale-up experiment, larval metamorphosis rates at 10 days after fertilization were significantly promoted by exposure to KCl or GABA at low concentration level. The inducement effects were similar to the results at laboratory scale experiment. The results imply that these inducers could be applied on the production of abalone hatchery industry.

The library was screened with three separate serine proteinase gene fragments amplified from cDNA of H. glycines using consensus oligonucleotide primers. Each predicted protein contains a secretion signal sequence, a propeptide and a mature protein of 226-296 amino acids. One of the predicted enzymes, HGSP-II has 41% identity to a chymotrypsin-like enzyme from the mollusc, Haliotis rufescens, and analysis of key residues involved in substrate binding also suggests a chymotrypsin-like specificity. HGSP-I and HGSP-III show greatest homology to kallikreins but sequence analysis does not allow prediction of their substrate preferences. Southern blot analysis suggests that HGSP-II and HGSP-III are encoded by single-copy genes in contrast to HGSP-I which may have two or more homologues. The regions encoding the mature proteinases were cloned into an expression vector and recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli. Both HGSP-I and HGSP-II were shown, after refolding, to cleave the synthetic peptide N-CBZ-Phe-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin, and this activity could be inhibited by the cowpea trypsin inhibitor, CpTI. HGSP-III showed no activity against the synthetic substrates tested.

PGE(2) amount increased nearly 2-fold and 47% when the seaweed was exposed to two ways of fluctuation of seawater salinity from 2% to 1% and 3% for 12 hr, respectively. The stresses of low temperature and irradiance promoted the seaweed to produce PGE(2). When the seaweeds were exposed to air for 2 hr and 4 hr, the PGE(2) levels were elevated by 25% and 31%, respectively. When the seaweed was soaked in freshwater, PGE(2) amount gradually decreased. Cu2+ and Zn2+ inhibited PGE(2) production at the concentrations of 3 and 50 mg/L, respectively. Mg2+ slightly inhibited PGE2 production about 20% at 2,025 mg/L, while Ca2+ boosted PGE(2) production about 59% at 600 mg/L. Hence, environmental factors significantly affect the PGE(2) production in the seaweed G. tenuistipitata. Prostaglandins might be associated with processes permitting the algae tissue to survive in unfavorable conditions. To lower the amount of PGE(2) in the seaweed and ensure the food safety, it is suggested to minimize the variation of growth condition to avoid PGE(2) increase in the seaweed during cultivation period.

In New South Wales changes in legal-sized and mature biomass will trigger management responses, in South Australia catch rates, size composition, and abundance indices provide target reference points, and in Tasmania, catch rates and catches have been used to provide triggers for Management decisions. However, Victoria and Western Australia have yet to determine their reference points for abalone stock assessment. Victoria has been developing length-based fisheries models similar to those applied in New South Wales and is now confronted with the necessity of converting model outputs into decision-making criteria. A Victorian fishery management plan is also under development in which reference points will be specified within a risk-based matrix of catch control rules for quota adjustments, Recent biodiversity conservation legislation, compelling fisheries management agencies in Australia to demonstrate that export fisheries managed under their jurisdictions are ecologically sustainable, has increased the urgency to establish these reference points. The application of this legislation draws upon the Principles and Criteria for Sustainable Fishing of the Marine Stewardship Council in London, We considered a range of alternative measures for reference points that may be useful as triggers and targets applied in a stochastic framework for management decisions. Although not a modeling output, one of the more consistent nonbiological signals of localized depletion in the Victorian fishery relates to spatial allocation of effort at the scale of reef complexes. Reductions in annual effort applied to a particular reef system invariably precede significant decreases in abundance indices with typically large coefficients of variation and in catch rates characterized by hyperstability. Victorian abalone divers have high daily catch expectations and allocate their effort accordingly. Empirical reference points, such as effort allocations, provide utility for Fishery management and can be readily assimilated and adopted by industry. Consequently, we conclude that in addition to modeling outputs, maintenance of reef-scale effort allocation and daily catch expectations should form part of a suite of fishery performance indicators and target criteria for the Victorian blacklip abalone fishery.",,"Gorfine, Harry/0000-0001-6933-3389",0730-8000,1943-6319,,DEC,,

The species has eight thoracic and three abdominal setigers, and is distinguished by the following features: 1) two pairs of radioles; 2) uncini in thoracic setigers 2-6 acicular, with main fang surmounted by small teeth, companion setae present; 3) uncini in thoracic setigers 7-8 avicular, with no main fang and teeth in a rasp-like (serpuliform) arrangement; 4) abdominal uncini acicular with main fang surmounted by small teeth. Members of T. heterouncinata are simultaneous hermaphrodites, with sperm produced in setiger 8 and oocytes in setigers 9-10. Sperm have an elongate nucleus and short midpiece.

Consequently, maintaining a sufficient number of separate families is often needed but costly and logistically difficult. Alternatively, parentage assignment can be obtained using DNA markers. We developed a panel of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for the European abalone Haliotis tuberculata using an existing transcriptomic resource. An initial set of 2,176,887 SNPs was filtered to select 500 for high throughput genotyping. Of these, 298 SNPs were amplified in at least 90% of our H. tuberculata samples, consisting of a mixed family cohort (945 offspring) generated by crossing 40 abalones, and 5 full-sib training families (70 offspring). Based on amplification success among parents, minimum allele frequency and checks carried out against the training families, a subset of 123 markers was used to carry out parentage assignment in our mixed family cohorts. Maximum likelihood and exclusion-based methods of parentage assignment yielded consistent results, allowing parentage to be assigned in 98.9% of the studied progeny. Optimization of markers suggests that the 60 most informative SNPs may be sufficient for 95% assignment success in these progeny. The panel was also used to estimate effective population size, and revealed a low N-e due to high variance of reproductive success between parents. Our panel could be used to estimate genetic parameters of traits in mixed family cohorts, an essential stage to initiate selective breeding in H. tuberculata.

In this study, we identified a lipopolysaccharide- and -1,3-glucan-binding protein (LGBP) gene from the pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai (HDH), which is involved in the pattern recognition mechanism and plays avital role in the defense mechanism of invertebrates immune system. The HDH-LGBP cDNA consisted of a 1263-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 420 amino acids, with a 20-amino-acid signal sequence. The molecular mass of the protein portion was 45.5 kDa, and the predicted isoelectric point of the mature protein was 4.93. Characteristic potential polysaccharide binding motif, glucanase motif, and -glucan recognition motif were identified in the LGBP of HDH. We used its polysaccharide-binding motif sequence to design two novel antimicrobial peptide analogs (HDH-LGBP-A1 and HDH-LGBP-A2). By substituting a positively charged amino acid and amidation at the C-terminus, the pI and net charge of the HDH-LGBP increased, and the proteins formed an -helical structure. The HDH-LGBP analogs exhibited antibacterial and antifungal activity, with minimal effective concentrations ranging from 0.008 to 2.2 g/mL. Additionally, both were toxic against human cervix (HeLa), lung (A549), and colon (HCT 116) carcinoma cell lines but not much on human umbilical vein cell (HUVEC). Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis showed that HDH-LGBP analogs disturb the cancer cell membrane and cause apoptotic cell death.

Infected abalone are characterised by multifocal areas of necrosis of the epithelium, underlying muscle fibres and connective tissues of the foot, epipodium and mantle. The lesions are typically 2-3 mm in diameter and contain numerous hyphae. Affected aquaculture facilities have suffered significant production losses, with up to 90% mortality among spat and up to 30% mortality among older animals. The pathogen has been identified as Halioticida noduliformans Muraosa, Morimoto, Sano, Nishimura and Hatai, 2009 from the morphological characteristics, the physiological characteristics that were investigated and molecular analysis of the large subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU rRNA) gene. Although the optimum temperature for growth of the fungus was 20-25 degrees C. it grew at a wide range of temperatures (10-25 degrees C). No growth occurred at 5 and 30 degrees C. The fungus grew well in peptone yeast glucose saline (PYGS) agar containing 50-100% seawater, with optimum growth occurring in full strength seawater (-35 ppt salinity). No vegetative growth was observed on PYG agar without seawater or supplemented exclusively with varying concentrations (0-5%) of NaCl. The isolate grew at a wide range of pH (4.0-10.0) with the optimum pH value of 7.0-8.0.

Meanwhile, edible Pleurotus abalonus as a member of Abalone mushroom family is a popular nutritional supplement that purportedly prevents cancer occurrence. However, these anecdotal claims are supported by limited studies describing tumor-inhibitory responses to the promising polysaccharides, and the molecular mechanisms underlying these properties have not yet been elucidated. Methodology/Principal Findings: We here fractionated the crude polysaccharide preparation from the fruiting bodies of P. abalonus into three fractions, namely PAP-1, PAP-2 and PAP-3, and tested these fractions for antiproliferative activity in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. The largest PAP-3, an acidic polysaccharide fraction with a molecular mass of 3.68x10(5) Da, was the most active in inhibiting MCF-7 cancer cells with an IC50 of 193 mu g/mL. The changes in cell normal morphology were observed by DAPI staining and the PAP-3-induced apoptosis was confirmed by annexin V/propidium iodide staining. The apoptosis was involved in mitochondria-mediated pathway including the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m), the increase of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, caspase-9/3 activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) degradation, as well as intracellular ROS production. PAP-3 also induced up-regulation of p53, and cell cycle arrest at the S phase. The incubation of MCF-7 cells with antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly attenuated the ROS generation and apoptosis caused by PAP-3, indicating that intracellular ROS plays a pivotal role in cell death. Conclusions/Significance: These findings suggest that the polysaccharides, especially acidic PAP-3, are very important nutritional ingredients responsible for, at least in part, the anticancer health benefits of P. abalonus via ROS-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. It is a major breakthrough bringing new insight of the potential use of the polysaccharides as health-care food or medicine to provide significant natural defense against human cancer.",10.1371/journal.pone.0064266,,1932-6203,,,May-14,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064266,23691187

This is a pattern typical of abalone species globally. However, movement may produce clustered distributions that promote fertilization success in broadcast spawners, such as abalone, even at low regional densities. We translocated wild, adult pink abalone Haliotis corrugata to an existing pink abalone patch to create a high-density aggregation, and then used acoustic telemetry to characterize abalone movement and monitor aggregation maintenance for a period of 14 mo in the Point Loma kelp forest near San Diego, California. Abalone showed a minimal flight response to handling that did not differ between the resident or translocated groups. Most individuals exhibited small home ranges (median area 183 m(2)) and homing behavior consisting of regular back-and-forth movement to a single point. Nomadic movement was also observed in several individuals. Though site fidelity may help maintain aggregations, abalone density decreased, and nearest neighbor distances increased at our site to near-initial levels after 18 mo via a combination of mortality, large movements of a few individuals, and small, incremental movements of most individuals. No coordinated movements that would suggest spawning behavior were observed. Translocation of wild abalone to produce aggregations may not result in high rates of fertilization success that promote population recovery. However, the homing behavior observed may provide more opportunities for mating than expectations based on static measures of density and aggregation state.",10.3354/meps10365,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps10365,

It functions as a cell survival protein that reduces that ability of a cell to undergo mitochondrial apoptosis. However, the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax is mainly effective in CLL, despite the expression of its protein target in NHL. We hypothesized that other mechanisms are inhibiting apoptosis in NHL: defects in pro-apoptotic signaling and/or the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins other than BCL2. Our study makes use of a technique known as BH3 profiling, which is a functional assay that determines the apoptotic competency of cells on primary NHL samples. By determining how cells in NHL avoid apoptosis upon exposure to venetoclax, we can identify patients who may benefit from additional therapies and potentially improve the response of drugs currently undergoing clinical trials for NHL. To determine causes of apoptotic resistance, we analyzed 124 primary B cell NHL samples using BH3 profiling, a technique that measures the mitochondrial permeabilization upon exposure to synthetic BH3 peptides. Our cohort included samples from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high-grade B cell lymphoma with translocations in MYC and BCL2 (HGBL-DH), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). While a large number of our samples displayed appropriate responses to apoptosis-inducing peptides, pro-apoptotic functional defects, implicating BAX, BAK, BIM or BID, were seen in 32.4% of high-grade NHLs (12/37) and in 3.4% of low-grade NHLs (3/87, p < 0.0001). The inhibition of single anti-apoptotic proteins induced apoptosis in only a few samples, however, the dual inhibition of BCL2 and MCL1 was effective in 83% of samples, indicating MCL1 was the most common cause of lack of response to the BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax. We then profiled Toledo and OCI-Ly8 high-grade lymphoma cell lines to determine which drugs could reduce MCL1 expression and potentiate venetoclax responses. Doxorubicin and vincristine decreased levels of MCL1 and increased venetoclax-induced apoptosis (all p < 0.05). Overall, in primary NHLs expressing BCL2 that have no defects in pro-apoptotic signaling, a poor response to venetoclax is primarily due to the presence of MCL1, which may be overcome by combining venetoclax with doxorubicin and vincristine-based chemotherapy or with other anti-microtubule inhibitors.",10.3390/cancers13051002,"del Rincon, Sonia/0000-0002-6350-0227; Rys, Ryan N./0000-0001-8862-961X; Geoffrion, Dominique/0000-0002-6368-7474; Letai, Anthony/0000-0002-1993-9013; Ghassemian, Artin/0000-0002-5810-0106; Ryan, Jeremy/0000-0002-3327-1283; SESQUES, Pierre/0000-0001-8264-822X; Staiger, Annette M./0000-0002-5896-3200",,2072-6694,,MAR,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cancers13051002,33670870

Seed production of Pacific abalone differs between northern and southern China and is dependent on sufficient quantities of broodstock, excess quantities of freshly cultured diatoms during the nursery phase, and tank hygiene and newly designed attachment methodology during the intermediate culture phase. Innovations in grow-out systems for Pacific abalone, such as stock enhancement in northern regions and commercial application of cage culture methods in southern regions, have further contributed to the success of Pacific abalone farming in China. There are still challenges in Pacific abalone-farming industry in China. First, mass mortality during the nursery and postlarval culture stages hinders seed production in northern and southern regions. Second, extreme weather events, including cold waters in northern regions and typhoons and red tides in southern regions, have occurred more frequently during recent years, and these events often cause high mortality of adult abalone during the grow-out phase.

Mytilus edulis, and its possible protective effects against a subsequent copper (CuSO4) exposure (56 mu g/L for 3 days). Selenium supplementation caused a 4-fold increase in glutathione levels in gills. The activity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase was modulated by selenium in gills (2-fold increase) and also in cell-free haemolymph (40% increase). Copper exposure produced decreases in protein thiol levels (35%) and in thioredoxin reductase activity (60%) in gills and induced an increase in DNA damage in haemocytes (70% increase in % tail DNA observed using the comet assay). The decrease in thioredoxin reductase activity may constitute a mechanism of copper toxicity in bivalves, warranting further investigation. Pre-treatment with selenium largely prevented these deleterious effects of copper on protein thiols, thioredoxin reductase activity and DNA damage.

We used pure blacklip (Haliotis rubra) and greenlip (Haliotis laevigata) abalone, as well as their hybrid, to test whether differences in movement and/or aerobic versus anaerobic energy use are linked to a purported increased growth rate in hybrids. Abalone were acclimated to control (16 degrees C) and typical summer temperatures (23 degrees C), each with oxygen treatments of 100% air saturation -(O(2)sat) or 70% -O(2)sat. The experiment then consisted of two phases. During the first phase (chronic exposure), movement and oxygen consumption rates (.O2) of abalone were measured during a 2 day observation period at stable acclimation conditions. Additionaly, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and tauropine dehydrogenase (TDH) activities were measured. During phase two (acute exposure), -O2sat was raised to 100% for abalone acclimated to 70% -O(2)sat followed by an acute decrease in oxygen to anoxia for all acclimation groups during which movement and.O-2 were determined again. During the chronic exposure, hybrids and H. laevigata moved shorter distances than H. rubra. Resting.O2, LDH and TDH activities, however, were similar between abalone types but were increased at 23 degrees C compared to 16 degrees C. During the acute exposure, the initial increase to 100% -O(2)sat for individuals acclimated to 70% -O(2)sat resulted in increased movement compared to individuals acclimated to 100% -O(2)sat for hybrids and H. rubra when compared within type of abalone. Similarly,.O-2 during spontaneous activity of all three types of abalone previously subjected to 70% -O(2)sat increased above those at 100% -O(2)sat. When oxygen levels had dropped below the critical oxygen level -(Pcrit), movement in hybrids and H. laevigata increased up to 6.5-fold compared to movement above -Pcrit. Differences in movement and energy use between hybrids and pure species were not marked enough to support the hypothesis that the purportedly higher growth in hybrids is due to an energetic advantage over pure species.",10.1007/s00360-021-01388-4,"Alter, Katharina/0000-0002-1801-748X; Elliott, Nicholas/0000-0003-4635-2143; Morash, Andrea/0000-0001-6161-9999; Andrew, Sean/0000-0002-8702-9759; Clark, Timothy/0000-0001-8738-3347; Andrewartha, Sarah/0000-0003-1973-9502; Frappell, Peter/0000-0001-6528-5447",0174-1578,1432-136X,,NOV,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00360-021-01388-4,34274983

Transition between these morphologically and ecologically distinct phases typically occurs when the developmentally competent larva comes into contact with a species-specific environmental cue. This cue acts as a morphogenetic signal that induces the completion of the postlarval/juvenile/adult developmental program at metamorphosis. The development of competence often occurs hours to days after the larva is morphologically mature. In the non-feeding - lecithotrophic - larvae of the ascidian Herdmania curvata and the gastropod mollusc Haliotis asinina, gene expression patterns in pre-competent and competent stages are markedly different, reflecting the different developmental states of these larval stages. For example, the expression of Hemps, an EGF-like signalling peptide required for the induction of Herdmania metamorphosis, increases in competent larvae. Induction of settlement and metamorphosis results in further changes in developmental gene expression, which apparently is necessary for the complete transformation of the larval body plan into the adult form.",,"Lavin, Martin/0000-0002-5940-4769; Jackson, Daniel John/0000-0001-9045-381X; Leys, Sally/0000-0001-9268-2181; Degnan, Bernard/0000-0001-7573-8518",0214-6282,1696-3547,,,,12141457

The mice were intraperitoneally injected with the extracts from the midgut glands of cultured scallops Patinopecten yessoensis gathered in early spring in Funka Bay, Hokkaido, Japan. The injections induced atypical symptoms in the mice within 24 h. The symptoms included piloerection, substantial eye discharge, swelling of the ears and head, and ear scratching. They were similar to those reported in studies of photosensitivity caused by pyropheophorbide in the midgut glands of abalones, which are herbivorous gastropods. The problematic scallops also accumulated a large amount of pyropheophorbide-a. The amount determined with high-performance liquid chromatography was 300-530 mu g per 1 g of the homogenate of the midgut glands. The dose of pyropheophorbide sufficient to cause photosensitivity in a mouse is estimated to be 0.99-2.3 mg per mouse with 20-g body weight. Moreover, comparative tests in mice showed that the onset of the symptoms required light and a substantial amount of pyropheophorbide. Therefore, we determined that the observed symptoms were photosensitivity caused by pyropheophorbide. Scallops, which are suspension-feeding bivalves, can accumulate a large amount of pyropheophorbide in the midgut glands depending on the habitat environment.",10.1007/s12562-010-0233-7,,0919-9268,,,MAY,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-010-0233-7,

Histological (hematoxylin-eosin) and histochemical (PAS Alcian Blue, Sudan Black, Dahl's) tools were used to determine variations in the glycogen index, lipid index, and calcium coverage index of mantle tissue as a function of seasonality (cold and warm period) and body region (dorsal, central, ventral). Anatomically, only two well-developed and functional mantle folds (inner and outer) were observed across the marginal zone, together with a poorly developed, and presumably, rudimentary fold with the same cellular morphology as the inner fold. The inner mantle epithelium stored significantly higher concentrations of glycogen and mucins, triglycerides, and calcium than the outer epithelium. This pattern occurred significantly more during the cold season than during the warm season. Mucins from mantle tissue not only regulate crystal nucleation and orientation during biomineralization, but also give the inner nacreous layer its luster and color. High concentrations of lipids in mantle tissue could help compensate for the energy loss caused by the wound-healing processes associated with mantle tissue removal and seeding, which are stressful and energetically costly. The absorption of calcium ions from the environment to integrate a microlaminate of calcareous compounds gives the shell its structural properties of hardness and strength. An approach with molecular-ultrastructural tools is recommended to broaden the understanding of mantle tissue regionalization and its relationship to pearl sac formation, which may help increase pearl yield and quality in H. rufescens.",10.2983/035.043.0107,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,APR,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.043.0107,

H. amussitatum is a dominant species on exposed crustose coralline algae (CCA) along the Sanriku coast in northeastern Japan, and it has been Suggested that it competes for food with postlarval abalone. The minimum densities of the gastropod required to inhibit the growth of diatoms were estimated to be < 10 g/m(2) at 20 degrees C, between 10-20 g/m(2) at 15 degrees C, and > 20 g/m(2) at 7 degrees C.

The two species of Type A were significantly affected by grazing pressure and did not increase even at a gastropod density of 10 g/m(2) at 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C. Types B and C diatoms were more tolerant of grazing by the gastropod than Type A species. However. the volumetric rate of ingestion of Cocconeis scutellum (Type B) by the gastropod was almost the same as for Novicula britannica (Type A) at the three experimental temperatures, when they were supplied to the gastropod independently. The digestion efficiencies of C. scutellum and N. britannica were 94.7% and 2.2%, respectively. The dietary value of C. scutellum for the gastropod H. amussitatum is thus considerably higher than that of N. britannica.

More efficient production strategies are necessary to ensure a sustainable mariculture sector, yet the potential of feasible production gains without further environmental impacts is largely unknown. This work took one of the biggest mariculture centers in China to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of mariculture products in 2003, 2010, and 2016, explore potential factors associated with resource use efficiency, and quantify the potential of these factors to increase regional production. The mariculture sector had a rapid expansion in 2003-2010 and accelerated product diversification in 2010-2016, with overall annual growth rates of 4.6%, 24.9%, 14.6%, 20.4%, 24.7%, and 8.7% in finfish (Larimichthys crocea and others), sea cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus), abalone (Haliotis spp.), laminaria (Laminaria japonica), gracilaria (Gracilaria spp.), and porphyra (Porphyra spp.) production, respectively. Resource use impacts were dominated by finfish production (over 90% of the total), but recent increases were mostly due to the farming of other products. Our study also identified several demographic (household size), socioeconomic (income per capita), technical (farming density, feed usage, and energy usage), and environmental (distance between farms and total nitrogen concentration) variables that were correlated with resource use efficiency. Simulations based on regression models suggested that changes in these factors could increase fish and seaweed production by at least 3%-18% and 2%-23%, respectively, without increasing resource use levels. Sustainable intensification of local mariculture systems could be achieved by enhancing the access to more efficient technology and financial capital, increasing the willingness of engagement in the sector, facilitating the transaction of sea use rights, reducing the amount of nutrient released in coastal areas, and including the heterogeneous effects of farm distances and water quality in marine spatial planning.

In contrast, knowledge about how the interactions between water temperature and diet affect the gut microbiota of marine invertebrates that do not thermoregulate is much less studied. In the present study, the effect of elevated seawater temperature and diet (Isochrysis zhanjiangensis and Platymonas helgolandica var. tsingtaoensis) on the gut microbial community of the commercial mussel, Mytilus coruscus, was investigated. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to characterize the microbial community in M. coruscus gut. The mortality of M. coruscus exposed to a high water temperature (31 degrees C) increased after 3 days and the diversity of the bacterial community in the gut of live M. coruscus was significantly reduced. For example, the abundance of Bacteroides (Bacteroidetes) and norank_Marinilabiaceae (Bacteroidetes) increased in the gut of M. coruscus fed I. zhanjiangensis. In M. coruscus fed P. helgolandica, the abundance of Arcobacter (Proteobacteria) and norank_Marinilabiaceae increased and the abundance of unclassified_Flavobacteriaceae (Bacteroidetes) decreased. The results obtained in the present study suggest that high temperatures favored the proliferation of opportunistic bacteria, including Bacteroides and Arcobacter, which may increase host susceptibility to disease.

PCP did not potentiate the effects demonstrated by salinity variations alone in red abalone, although chemotaxis was further compromised in black abalone exposed to high salinity stress combined with PCP. Although chemotactic ability was similar among both species, both %P and PI was greater among black abalone. Low salinity may offset the effects of PCP in red but not black abalone. Whereas red abalone demonstrated a reduction in phagocytic ability upon exposure to high salinity alone, black abalone appeared more resilient to high salinity stress alone. Furthermore, while the effect of high salinity plus PCP is subadditive among red abalone, high salinity seems to potentiate the effect of PCP on black abalone, Finally, hemocytes exposed to acute salinity variations plus PCP showed varying morphological characteristics when compared to controls. Over 30% of hemocytes of high salinity plus PCP exposed abalone remained rounded and generally unattached to glass slides with only a few pseudopod extensions. Hemocyte preparations incubated in rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin were observed with fluorescence microscopy and reveal an altered actin filament pattern. Overall, black abalone demonstrate greater phagocytic ability than red abalone both in the presence and absence of PCP. Furthermore, increases in salinity are accompanied with reduced phagocytic ability with red abalone demonstrating particular sensitivity to salinity variations. While PCP inhibits ATP synthesis, salinity variations may impose an additional stress on intertidal animals exposed to transient or seasonal environmental changes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Sulfated polysaccharide from pacific abalone (AGSP) reduced the level of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and increased the production of short chain fatty acids in the colon of mice, and it reduced the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and increased the IL-10 level in in vitro cell models, suggesting that it can be used as a probiotic agent to inhibit intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, AGSP reduced the disease activity index and intestinal damage, improved the mucosal immune response, and inhibited oxidative damage in mice with DSS-induced acute and chronic colitis, which can be associated with modulation of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway and gut microbiota. AGSP regulated the structure of the gut microbiota and reduced the level of Bacteroides that had positive correlation with the colitis symptoms. The in vitro result showed that AGSP may inhibit mucin degradation by Bacteroides via the change of the polysaccharide utilization strategy, which can protect intestinal barrier integrity.

However, Vibrio spp. infections have caused a great economic loss in Pacific white shrimp culture industry. The immune responses of Pacific white shrimp to the Vibrio spp. is not fully characterized. In this study, the transcriptomic profiles of L. vannamei hemocytes were explored by injecting with or without Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Totally, 42,632 high-quality unigenes were obtained from RNAseq data. Comparative genome analysis showed 2258 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) following the Vibrio challenge, including 1017 up-regulated and 1241 down-regulated genes. Eight DEGs were randomly selected for further validation by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and the results showed that are consistent with the RNA-seq data. Due to the lack of predictable adaptive immunity, shrimps rely on an innate immune system to defend themselves against invading microbes by recognizing and clearing them through humoral and cellular immune responses. Here we focused our studies on the humoral immunity, five genes (SR, MNK, CTL3, GILT, and ALFP) were selected from the transcriptomic data, which were significantly up-regulated by V. parahaemolyticus infection. These genes were widely expressed in six different tissues and were up-regulated by both Gram negative bacteria (V. parahaemolyticus) and Gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus). To further extend our studies, we knock-down those five genes by dsRNA in L. vannamei and analyzed the functions of specific genes against V. parahaemolyticus and S. aureus by bacterial clearance analysis. We found that the ability of L. vannamei was significantly reduced in bacterial clearance when treated with those specific dsRNA. These results indicate that those five genes play essential roles in antibacterial immunity and have its specific functions against different types of pathogens. The obtained data will shed a new light on the immunity of L. vannamei and pave a new way for fighting against the bacterial infection in Pacific white shrimp.",10.1016/j.fsi.2018.03.030,"lin, li/0000-0003-2783-1114; Vijayaraman, Sarath Babu/0000-0002-8555-0575; Wan, Quanyuan/0000-0003-4227-1530; Li, Jun/0000-0002-5190-0733",1050-4648,1095-9947,,JUN,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.03.030,29567139

The species is on a decline due to depletion of forest cover, predation by natural enemies, and collection. To facilitate the conservation of the species, it is important to decide on a number of traits related to growth, immunity and reproduction addressing fitness advantage of the species.ResultsThe visceral mass transcriptome of I. fruhstorferi was enabled using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencing platform. According to BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) method, the transcriptome was considered complete with 91.8% of ortholog genes present (Single: 70.7%; Duplicated: 21.1%). A total of 96.79% of the raw read sequences were processed as clean reads. TransDecoder identified 197,271 contigs that contained candidate-coding regions. Of a total of 50,230 unigenes, 34,470 (68.62% of the total unigenes) annotated to homologous proteins in the Protostome database (PANM-DB). The GO term and KEGG pathway analysis indicated genes involved in metabolism, phosphatidylinositol signalling system, aminobenzoate degradation, and T-cell receptor signalling pathway. Many genes associated with molluscan innate immunity were categorized under pathogen recognition receptor, TLR signalling pathway, MyD88 dependent pathway, endogenous ligands, immune effectors, antimicrobial peptides, apoptosis, and adaptation-related. The reproduction-associated unigenes showed homology to protein fem-1, spermatogenesis-associated protein, sperm associated antigen, and testis expressed sequences, among others. In addition, we identified key growth-related genes categorized under somatotrophic axis, muscle growth, chitinases and collagens. A total of 4822 Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) were also identified from the unigene sequences of I. fruhstorferi.ConclusionsThis is the first available genomic information for non-model land slug, I. fruhstorferi focusing on genes related to growth, immunity, and reproduction, with additional focus on microsatellites and repeating elements.

Abalone cell culture is being given importance in order to develop a technology for in-vitro pearl production, as the cultured pearls are highly valuable in terms of high quality. Separate studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of depuration and to standardise the optimum dose of antimicrobial agents. Mantle tissue from depurated and non-depurated abalones (Haliotis varia) was used simultaneously to study the effect of depuration in cell yield. During the study, contamination was found to be more in depurated tissues than in non-depurated ones. Role of antibiotics such as streptomycin and penicillin on cell proliferation and contamination was studied by washing tissues using solutions containing three different doses of antibiotics, prior to initiation of culture. In the first experiment, washing of tissue in seawater containing 1000 mu g ml(-1) of streptomycin and 2000 IU ml(-1) of penicillin yielded more cell proliferation with less contamination.

Pressurization at 200 MPa caused a decrease in pH and shear force compared to those in the control but thereafter increased with increasing pressure levels. Water holding capacity (WHC) of abalone decreased when pressurized at >400 MPa. A greater reduction in shear force was observed after 1 week of storage. For color, reduction in the a* value of abalone was considerable during storage. Increasing pressure suppressed the generation of total volatile basic nitrogen compounds and total viable counts, whereas lipid oxidation occurred with increasing pressure. Pressurization at 200 MPa was the optimum pressure condition in which the shelf-life of abalone was extended to about 10 days compared to 3 days in the control. Industrial relevance: For the use of high pressure as a pasteurization technique, commercial system is required not to exceed 5 min of holding time for the system maintenance purpose. In addition, this process is carried out under ambient temperature for the economical aspect. The abalone which is normally consumed as raw state in East Asia has very short shelf-life (<3 days) during chilled storage, hence increasing the shelf-life for 7-8 days has been challenged for commercial distribution of the abalone.

This article examines the very late (post-950 cal BP) appearance of numerous red abalone processing sites on the Monterey Peninsula in central California. We test three prominent explanations offered for the sudden onset of red abalone processing sites: trophic cascades resulting from human predation on sea otters, logistical foraging by inland residents, and changes in sea surface temperature. A trophic cascade appears to have occurred but does not fully explain the nature or timing of the phenomenon in the region. We present an alternative explanation that argues that intensive procurement of red abalone emerged at a time when both population pressure and social complexity increased greatly in central California. We argue that a new exploitation strategy-diving from boats-was employed to exploit a much larger portion of the red abalone habitat. This strategy entailed logistical forays by divers who worked new patches in tandem with boaters, gathered large quantities in a single foray, and then field processed them in bulk on the shore before transporting the meat to coastal residences. This strategy provided an additional source of food, and both tradable dried meat and numerous large shells that could be manufactured into ornaments and traded as decorative accoutrements. We conclude our discussion with a consideration of the factors that created such a discontinuous record of red abalone exploitation along the California coast. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, mucus secreted from these gastropods has been shown to induce larval settlement, but the stimulatory components of mucus have not been thoroughly investigated. We now present data confirming that GABA is the settlement-inducing effector molecule contained within abalone mucus. To do this, we initially generated anti-GABA for use in immunoenzyme and immunofluorescent microscopy. Using these techniques GABA was identified in the nerves and epithelial cells of the foot, including mucus. Dried mucus samples subject to HPLC analysis revealed a mean concentration of 0.68 mM GABA after sample rehydration. The presence of GABA in these samples was confirmed by time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (TOF-MS).

Allozyme variation was low, but more similar than the one reported in other haliotids. Malate dehydrogenase (MDH-1 and MDH-2) and glutamate oxalate transaminase (GOT) in some population were fixed. There were not observed significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium among 31 comparisons made over all loci and all populations. F statistics did not indicate departure from random mating or evidence of genetic structuring of the H. fulgens populations, however F-IT and F-IS data showed that inbreeding occurs inside abalone sites. Additionally, cluster analysis and Mantel tests showed that genetic differences among abalone populations were not accumulative geographically. Data do not suggest that H. fulgens populations are genetically isolated from one another. The five populations formed a homogeneous group respect to allele frequencies at six of the seven loci analyzed. Therefore, they cannot be considered as different stocks.

A previous researcher discovered that seawater extracts of mud from juvenile habitats could induce metamorphosis and provided evidence that the inductive agent was of biological origin. Because juvenile L obsoleta are herbivorous and grow when fed diets of benthic diatoms, we hypothesized that benthic diatoms or their associated microflora might be responsible for producing a metamorphic stimulus. We tested extracts of a culture of mixed diatoms and extracts of cultures of 6 diatom species isolated from mudflat sediments along the coast of North Carolina in which sexually mature and immature adult (juvenile) L obsoleta commonly co-occur. We also tested extracts of one diatom culture isolated at the Friday Harbor Laboratories (Friday Harbor, WA). We found differential effects among the diatom species tested. One centric diatom, Coscino-discus sp., induced metamorphosis at levels close to those triggered by a known neuroactive compound, serotonin. Several species of benthic diatoms displayed neutral effects, showing little or no inductive capability. In one experiment, an unidentified pennate diatom species appeared to inhibit spontaneous metamorphosis that occurred in some competent larvae.

Technologies for culturing a range of seaweed species have been developed successively in Korea since the 1970s. In 2017, Korean marine farms produced 1,761,526 t of seaweed. The key focus of the industry is on the production of Pyropia (523,648 t), Undaria (622,613 t), and Saccharina (542,285 t). Pyropia is economically the most important species in Korea, accounting for up to 68% of total production value. As the top exporter of Pyropia in the world, Korea exported up to US $525 million of Pyropia products to 110 countries in 2018. Other economically important genera include Sargassum, Ulva, Capsosiphon, Codium, and Gracilariopsis, all of which are used for food, and Gelidium, Pachymeniopsis, and Ecklonia which are used as raw material for phycocolloid extraction. Significant work has gone into developing more productive strains of key seaweed species, and in 2012 the Korean government began to certify seaweed varieties. To date, 19 seaweed cultivars have been registered including 13 Pyropia, 5 Undaria, and 1 Saccharina. The industry is now seeking not only to increase productivity but also to add value through processing. Convenience foods and snacks have been developed that target health-conscious consumers and utilize the nutritional properties of seaweeds. The industry is also seeking to promote the sustainability of seaweed farming. One seaweed company in Korea obtained the world's first ASC-MSC (Aquaculture Stewardship Council-Marine Stewardship Council) certification in 2019 and more are expected to follow their lead. With continued research support, the Korean seaweed industry plans to continue to expand to meet new market demands at a sustainable pace.",10.4490/algae.2020.35.5.15,,1226-2617,2093-0860,,JUN,http://dx.doi.org/10.4490/algae.2020.35.5.15,

A focus of this research has been the nacreous inner layer of the shell with its conspicuous arrangement of aragonite platelets, resembling in cross-section a brick-and-mortar wall. In comparison, the outer, less stable, calcitic prismatic layer has received much less attention. One of the first molluscan shell proteins to be characterized at the molecular level was Lustrin A, a component of the nacreous organic matrix of Haliotis rufescens. This was soon followed by the C-type lectin perlucin and the growth factor-binding perlustrin, both isolated from H. laevigata nacre, and the crystal growth-modulating AP7 and AP24, isolated from H. rufescens nacre. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics was subsequently applied to to Haliotis biomineralization research with the analysis of the H. asinina shell matrix and yielded 14 different shell-associated proteins. That study was the most comprehensive for a Haliotis species to date. Methods: The shell proteomes of nacre and prismatic layer of the marine gastropod Haliotis laevigata were analyzed combining mass spectrometry-based proteomics and next generation sequencing. Results: We identified 297 proteins from the nacreous shell layer and 350 proteins from the prismatic shell layer from the green lip abalone H. laevigata. Considering the overlap between the two sets we identified a total of 448 proteins. Fifty-one nacre proteins and 43 prismatic layer proteins were defined as major proteins based on their abundance at more than 0.2% of the total. The remaining proteins occurred at low abundance and may not play any significant role in shell fabrication. The overlap of major proteins between the two shell layers was 17, amounting to a total of 77 major proteins. Conclusions: The H. laevigata shell proteome shares moderate sequence similarity at the protein level with other gastropod, bivalve and more distantly related invertebrate biomineralising proteomes. Features conserved in H. laevigata and other molluscan shell proteomes include short repetitive sequences of low complexity predicted to lack intrinsic three-dimensional structure, and domains such as tyrosinase, chitin-binding, and carbonic anhydrase.

LPS (5mg/kg body weight) produced hepatic damage that was manifested by significant increases in the activities of marker enzymes (aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase) and reduced antioxidant (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, malondialdehyde) activities. These antioxidant activities were elevated by HDE administration to LPS-treated rats. These results suggested that HDE extracts had a potential hepatoprotective effect in LPS-induced liver damage without any acute toxicity.

Within species, however, the allometry between mortality rates and body mass has received substantially less attention and the consistency of such scaling patterns at the intra-specific level is controversial. We reviewed 73 experimental studies to examine the relationship between mortality rates and body size among seven species of abalone (Haliotis spp.), a marine herbivorous mollusk. Both in the field and in the laboratory, log-transformed mortality rates were negatively correlated with log-transformed individual body mass for all species considered, with allometric exponents remarkably similar among species. This regular pattern confirms previous findings that juvenile abalones suffer higher mortality rates than adult individuals. Field mortality rates were higher overall than those measured in the laboratory, and the relationship between mortality and body mass tended to be steeper in field than in laboratory conditions for all species considered. These results suggest that in the natural environment, additional mortality factors, especially linked to predation, could significantly contribute to mortality, particularly at small body sizes. On the other hand, the consistent allometry of mortality rates versus body mass in laboratory conditions suggests that other sources of mortality, beside predation, are size-dependent in abalone.",10.1007/s00442-011-2163-1,"Micheli, Fiorenza/0000-0002-6865-1438; De Leo, Giulio/0000-0002-4186-3369; Bevacqua, Daniele/0000-0002-3341-1696",0029-8549,1432-1939,,APR,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-011-2163-1,22020817

Gastropod molluscs have proved to be particularly useful foci for such studies, but the developmental expression of FaRPs and the evolution of specific transcripts for different peptides are unclear within the molluscs. Here we show that FaRPs are encoded by two transcripts that appear to be splice variants of a single gene in the abalone, Haliotis asinina, which represents the basal vetigastropods. Has-FMRF1 comprises 1,438 nucleotides and encodes a precursor protein of 329 amino acids that can potentially produce two copies of FLRFamide, one copy each of TLAGDSFLR-Famide, QFYRIamide, SDPDLDDVIRASLLAYSLDDSPNN, and SVATAPVEAKAVEAGNKDIE, and 13 copies of FMRFamide. The second 1,241-nucleotide transcript, Has-FMRF2, encodes a 206-amino acid precursor protein with single copies of FLRFamide and FMRFamide along with such extended forms as NFGEPFLRFamide, FDSYEDKALR-Famide, and NGWLHFamide, in addition to SDPGEDMLK-SILLRGAPSNNGLQY and DTUDETTUNDNAHSRQ. Both transcripts are present early in life and are expressed in different but overlapping patterns within the developing larval nervous system. Mass spectrometry and immunocytochemistry demonstrate that FaRPs are cleaved from larger precursors and localize to the developing nervous system. Our results confirm previous evidence that FaRPs are expressed early and potentially play many roles during molluscan development and suggest that the last common ancestor to living gastropods used alternative splicing of an FMRFamide gene to generate a diversity of FaRPs in spatially restricted patterns in the nervous system.

High demand for the product, both on national and international markets, makes these species vulnerable, putting natural populations at risk. The aim of this study was to apply cryopreservation techniques to M. pyrifera gametophytes in the laboratory and evaluate their effect on gametophyte development and maturity and on the subsequent growth of juvenile sporophytes. To this end, gametophytes obtained in laboratory cultures were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then defrozen, in order to restart their growth under controlled light, photoperiod and temperature conditions. Thirty-five days after defreezing, the gametophytes grew normally and matured sexually, differentiating in to male and female gametophytes (53 and 47%, respectively). Once fertilized, the growth and development phase of juveni le sporophytes begins, reaching an average daily growth rate of 10.4%. Results indicate that cryopreservation is a successful preservation technique, recommended for maintaining M. pyrifera gametophyte stock under laboratory conditions for prolonged periods.",10.4067/S0718-19572015000200002,,0717-3326,0718-1957,,APR,http://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0718-19572015000200002,

However, interactions with other important local and global drivers such as ocean acidification, eutrophication and sedimentation, and the physiological mechanisms via which MHWs act on species are poorly understood. Additionally, past studies have often focused on ecologically dominant taxa such as kelps, fucoids and coral, potentially leading to a lack of understanding of direct impacts on associated species. To this end, we examined the individual and interactive impacts of MHW duration (14 and 28 days) and intensity (20.5 degrees C and 23 degrees C) as well as irradiance (2.3 and 4.4 mol m(-2) d(-1)) on standardized growth of Caulerpa brownii, Corallina berteroi and Phymatolithopsis complex, three temperate macroalgal taxa that are important spaceholders in their native ecosystem in Te Whanganui a Tara Wellington, Aotearoa New Zealand. All three taxa exhibited no declines in growth in response to the exposure to longer and more intense MHWs. We posit that the simulated MHW scenarios were tolerated due to large thermal safety margins which can be expected from the range centre/leading edge position of the sampled populations, even though some of these scenarios far exceeded the intensities encountered in this region previously. Interactions between intensity, duration and irradiance were limited to an antagonistic irradiance-duration interaction in the non-calcareous green macroalga Ca. brownii only. Together, the displayed tolerance of the study species to the simulated scenarios implies limited impacts of strong MHWs four weeks or shorter in duration on ecosystem functioning in New Zealand kelp forest systems if brown algal canopies remain intact.",10.1080/00318884.2023.2267411,"Krieger, Erik/0000-0002-3940-3785; taise-uili, aleluia/0000-0003-1044-9779; Cornwall, Christopher/0000-0002-6154-4082; Berbece, Denisa/0009-0007-4377-4240; Sarid-Segal, Yaelle/0009-0006-1095-0167",0031-8884,2330-2968,,Nov-02,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00318884.2023.2267411,

AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH A 13C-ENRICHED AMINO ACID,2012,JOURNAL OF MOLLUSCAN STUDIES,78,,100,104,,"Many marine gastropod species brood their embryos in thin-walled capsules to protect them during development. Despite its beneficial effects, encapsulation has two major constraints, nutrition and oxygen supply, which affect embryo development and larval survival. Developing embryos usually rely on intracapsular food sources provided by the mother, in the form of yolk, nurse eggs and intracapsular fluid. However, it is still not clear if they are able to feed on extracapsular sources that may cross the capsule wall. We investigated this possibility in the calyptraeid species Crepidula fornicata. In this species, the internal capsule wall thickness sharply decreases during embryonic development, which might change wall permeability to small organic molecules, thus providing embryos with external dissolved organic matter. To test this hypothesis, encapsulated and excapsulated embryos of C. fornicata were placed for 48 h in a C-13-enriched amino acid (L-alanine) solution. Excapsulated embryos were enriched in C-13 (+5.75%), which suggested that they were able to assimilate the labelled amino acid. In contrast, encapsulated embryos were weakly enriched (+0.75%), suggesting that encapsulation greatly reduces the potential for the use of extracapsular amino acids and that encapsulated embryos mainly rely on maternal food.",10.1093/mollus/eyr044,"LEROUX, Cedric/0000-0001-9225-1234; Brante, Antonio/0000-0002-2699-9700",0260-1230,,,FEB,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mollus/eyr044,

A coastal conifer forest covered highlands of Santa Rosa during the last glacial, but by ca. 11 800 cal. a BP Pinus stands, coastal sage scrub and grassland replaced the forest as the climate warmed. The early Holocene became increasingly drier, particularly after ca. 9150 cal. a BP, as the pond dried frequently, and coastal sage scrub covered the nearby hillslopes. By ca. 6900 cal. a BP grasslands recovered at both sites. Pollen of wetland plants became prominent at Soledad Pond after ca. 4500 cal. a BP, and at Abalone Rocks Marsh after ca. 3465 cal. a BP. Diatoms suggest freshening of the Abalone Rocks Marsh somewhat later, probably by additional runoff from the highlands. Introduction of non-native species by ranchers occurred subsequent to AD 1850. Charcoal influx is high early in the record, but declines during the early Holocene when minimal biomass suggests extended drought. A general increase occurs after ca. 7000 cal. a BP, and especially after ca. 4500 cal. a BP. The Holocene pattern closely resembles population levels constructed from the archaeological record, and suggests a potential influence by humans on the fire regime of the islands, particularly during the late Holocene.

This research focuses on northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana) in Haida Gwaii, the home of the Haida Nation. The Haida have developed a range of values associated with abalone, including reciprocity. However, commercial fishing and colonial mismanagement have led to overexploitation, resulting in a prohibition on all gatherings since 1990. Despite this, the relationship between the Haida and abalone persists in the community's knowledge. We used the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) framework and the concept of reciprocal contributions to help paint a complex relationship between Haida knowledge holders and abalone, identifying values, benefits, drivers and barriers. We identified food uses and meanings that include emotional experiences. Additionally, we compiled an array of reciprocal contributions, such as enhancement actions, fishing guidelines and nature protection practices. These memories and guidelines have been passed down through generations. The principle of 'take only what you need to eat' is essential for managing abalone populations. Reciprocal actions have been crucial for both abalone and the Haida. Elders have transplanted abalone to other sites, and the Council of the Haida Nation continues monitoring and restoration work. Cultural and ecological education about abalone is preserved through family stories, school activities and ceremonies, reinforcing its status as a culturally important species. The abalone fishing boom and Canadian mismanagement were identified as negative drivers that significantly impacted abalone populations. Most Haida elders recall their efforts in the 1970s to raise concerns with the federal fishing agency about the declining abalone population, but their warnings went unheeded. Currently, due to limited enforcement capacity, abalone poaching is the primary concern, while bureaucratic hurdles in decision-making processes impede effective assessment and management. This work contributes to reviewing the past and rethinking management strategies in local contexts where values like reciprocity remain integral to Indigenous people. It also aims to generate dialogues and actions with international fisheries platforms, facilitating learning from other local experiences and recognizing common colonial barriers worldwide.

In many places, overfishing has led to the decimation of wild stocks and many are now reared in aquaculture systems. In the Azores, there is no tradition of eating abalones and Haliotis tuberculate stocks are still virtually untouched. However, as tourism in the islands grows and the stocks of other shellfish diminish, there is an increasing pressure to find alternative edible resources, leading to a rising interest in abalones. According to previous studies performed in the region, other edible species, including the local highly appreciated limpets and the giant barnacle, present high concentration levels of some heavy metals, which has been attributed to the volcanic origin of the islands. Here we analysed the metal content in the edible tissue of Haliotis tuberculate from Sao Miguel Island, Azores. The potential human health risks due to its consumption was assessed by estimating the average daily intake (EDI) and target hazard quotient (THQ) of metals. Similarly to other organisms in the Azores, abalones have higher than normal levels of some heavy metals, particularly cadmium, reflecting a local natural source that should be closely monitored from a public health point of view.

QdNOs are reported to exhibit cytotoxicity, photoallergy, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity activities. To monitor for contamination of QdNOS in abalone and assess dietary exposure, a simple and reliable analytical method for the detection of QdNOs and their major metabolites was developed. Results This work is the first to present a simple and fast pretreatment procedure coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography tandem positive-mode electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for tracing of major metabolites of QdNOs in abalone. Extraction steps were simplified by the use of methanol and ethyl acetate containing 0.1% formic acid instead of more complicated acidolysis and enzymolysis pretreatment procedures. High-sensitive characters were obtained with limits of detection ranged from 0.16 to 2.1 mu g kg(-1) for QdNOs and their major metabolites. Conclusion These results indicate that the LC-MS/MS method developed could be applied for QdNOs and major metabolites detection in actual samples. Considering the large production and consumption of abalone in Shandong Province, China, this work will also contribute to the further understanding of the often-ignored exposure pathway of QdNOs.

The quality properties of baked abalone (150-210 A degrees C, 10-30 min) with and without pre-tenderization treatment prior to baking were evaluated through sensory evaluation, textural analysis and Hunter Lab colorimeter. In addition, amounts of sugars and alpha-dicarbonyl compounds in these products were determined via HPLC analyses. The baking condition at 180 A degrees C for 20 min combined with pre-tenderization resulted in an optimal product.

Osteoblastic cells were treated with the highly reducing sugar, dRib, in the presence or absence of CZE. Cell viability, apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were subsequently examined. It was observed that dRib reduced cell survival, while it markedly increased the intracellular levels of ROS and apoptosis. However, pre-treatment of the cells with CZE attenuated all the dRib-induced effects. The antioxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), also prevented dRib-induced oxidative cell damage. In addition, treatment with CZE resulted in a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and collagen content, as well as in the expression of genes associated with osteoblast differentiation [ALP, collagen, osteopontin (OPN), osteoprotegerin (OPG), bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteocalcin (OC) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)2, BMP4 and BMP7]. In mechanistic studies of the antioxidative potential of CZE, we found that CZE reversed the dRib-induced decrease in the expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT)1 and AKT2 genes, which are master regulators of survival-related signaling pathways. CZE also upregulated the gene expression of the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD)2, SOD3 and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), which was inhibited by dRib.

Abalone are well known for exhibiting spatial heterogeneity in their biological properties. Each population in the simulation was represented by a size-based population dynamics model and had biological properties of growth, maturation, emergence from crypsis, and mortality specific to each population; the range of these properties varies to different degrees in the different quota zones around Tasmania. The simulation was used to compare the effects of applying different legal minimum length (LML) regulations on the fishery. Because of spatial heterogeneity in growth, a single LML within a zone has always been a compromise between underprotecting some populations and overprotecting others. The simulation was used to determine the protection afforded the overall mature biomass and the variation likely among different populations, and how these populations then responded to exploitation.

The study was composed of two experiments. In the first, we compared sheltering between two groups of 100 individuals each reared in either natural or artificial seawater. For 15 days, a score was assigned every day to the position occupied by each individual, i.e. 0 when it was out of the hide, 1 when it was on the bottom of the maintenance tank underneath the hide, and 2 when it occupied the inner spot of the hide. Our results show that artificial seawater significantly affects sheltering: only the individuals reared in natural seawater were able to reach the hide and maintain a position in it. Chemical analyses revealed that artificial seawater differed from natural seawater for a relatively low concentration of Ca2+. In the second experiment we compared H. tuberculata's sheltering behavior in three media, natural, artificial, and calcium-enriched artificial seawater. Sheltering was restored in enriched artificial seawater, which supports the hypothesis that calcium has an effect on this species' behavior. However, calcium concentration both in the artificial and natural water showed a progressive decrease with time likely due to the absorption by abalones, which suggests that in closed systems calcium supply is constantly required, even when the used medium is natural seawater.

As climate change alters ocean conditions, the dispersal of these larvae will be affected, with pervasive ecological and evolutionary consequences. We review the impacts of oceanic changes on larval transport, physiology, and behavior. We then discuss the implications for population connectivity and recruitment and evaluate life history strategies that will affect susceptibility to the effects of climate change on their dispersal patterns, with implications for understanding selective regimes in a future ocean. We find that physical oceanographic changes will impact dispersal by transporting larvae in different directions or inhibiting their movements while changing environmental factors, such as temperature, pH, salinity, oxygen, ultraviolet radiation, and turbidity, will affect the survival of larvae and alter their behavior. Reduced dispersal distance may make local adaptation more likely in well-connected populations with high genetic variation while reduced dispersal success will lower recruitment with implications for fishery stocks. Increased dispersal may spur adaptation by increasing genetic diversity among previously disconnected populations as well as increasing the likelihood of range expansions. We hypothesize that species with planktotrophic (feeding), calcifying, or weakly swimming larvae with specialized adult habitats will be most affected by climate change. We also propose that the adaptive value of retentive larval behaviors may decrease where transport trajectories follow changing climate envelopes and increase where transport trajectories drive larvae toward increasingly unsuitable conditions. Our holistic framework, combined with knowledge of regional ocean conditions and larval traits, can be used to produce powerful predictions of expected impacts on larval dispersal as well as the consequences for connectivity, range expansion, or recruitment. Based on our findings, we recommend that future studies take a holistic view of dispersal incorporating biological and oceanographic impacts of climate change rather than solely focusing on oceanography or physiology. Genetic and paleontological techniques can be used to examine evolutionary impacts of altered dispersal in a future ocean, while museum collections and expedition records can inform modern-day range shifts.",10.1002/ecs2.3015,"Bashevkin, Samuel/0000-0001-7406-7089",2150-8925,,,JAN,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3015,

Arthropods and mollusks are best represented in the diet. The diet of P. ochraceus varies with local ecological situation; certain sedentary or slow-moving animals are fed upon more or less in proportion to their abundance and availability while others are not. The mussel, Mytilus californianus, is used by the starfish as the main source of food in regions of mussel beds, and 2 barnacles, Balanus glandula and Tetraclita squamosa rubescens, are main food sources in regions not suitable for Mytilus growth. Mytilus and/or barnacles form approximately 80% of Pisaster''s diet in these areas. In areas where neither barnacles nor mussels are abundant, Pisaster turns more to gastropods and chitons and tends to be less dependent on any 1 particular species. Some abundant and apparently available species are rarely eaten. These are species such as Haliotis cracherodii and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, which appear to have developed means of escape from, or of defense against, starfish.",,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,

We addressed this question using a knockin mouse line expressing cyclic adenosine monophosphate-insensitive HCN4 channels. This mouse line displayed a complex cardiac phenotype characterized by sinus dysrhythmia, severe sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses and chronotropic incompetence. Furthermore, the absence of CDR leads to inappropriately enhanced heart rate responses of the SAN to vagal nerve activity in vivo. The mechanism underlying these symptoms can be explained by the presence of nonfiring pacemaker cells. We provide evidence that a tonic and mutual interaction process (tonic entrainment) between firing and nonfiring cells slows down the overall rhythm of the SAN. Most importantly, we show that the proportion of firing cells can be increased by CDR of HCN4 to efficiently oppose enhanced responses to vagal activity. In conclusion, we provide evidence for a novel role of CDR of HCN4 for the central pacemaker process in the sinoatrial node. The involvement of cAMP-dependent regulation of HCN4 in the chronotropic heart rate response is a matter of debate. Here the authors use a knockin mouse model expressing cAMP-insensitive HCN4 channels to discover an inhibitory nonfiring cell pool in the sinoatrial node and a tonic and mutual interaction between firing and nonfiring pacemaker cells that is controlled by cAMP-dependent regulation of HCN4, with implications in chronotropic heart rate responses.",10.1038/s41467-020-19304-9,"Fenske, Stefanie/0000-0002-6994-8401; Hennis, Konstantin/0000-0003-0343-0068; Becirovic, Elvir/0000-0001-8801-0649; Pauza, Audrys G./0000-0001-9635-8872",2041-1723,,,Nov-03,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19304-9,33144559

Here we discuss the utility of phylogenetics in detecting adaptive evolution at the molecular level and, for illustration, we concentrate on a family of surface-exposed proteins (the rifins) found in the recently sequenced genome of Plasmodium fialciparum. We employed phylogeny-based methods in order to characterize adaptive evolution in these proteins. We found evidence for adaptive evolution in many of the amino acid residues in at least one lineage. These results indicate that there has been selection for those strains of P. fialciparum that contain the new genotypes.

However, the dynamics that underlie the emergence of disease outbreaks in marine ecosystems still lack the equivalent level of description, conceptual understanding, and modeling context routinely present in the terrestrial systems. Here, we propose a theoretical basis for modeling the transmission of marine infectious diseases (MIDs) developed from simple models of the spread of infectious disease. The models represent the dynamics of a variety of host-pathogen systems including those unique to marine systems where transmission of disease is by contact with waterborne pathogens both directly and through filter-feeding processes. Overall, the analysis of the epizootiological models focused on the most relevant processes that interact to drive the initiation and termination of epizootics. A priori, systems with multi-step disease infections (e.g., infection-death-particle release-filtration-transmission) reduced dependence on individual parameters resulting in inherently slower transmissions rates. This is demonstrably not the case; thus, these alternative transmission pathways must also considerably increase the rates of processes involved in transmission. Scavengers removing dead infected animals may inhibit disease spread in both contact-based and waterborne pathogen-based diseases. The capacity of highly infected animals, both alive and dead, to release a substantial number of infective elements into the water column, making them available to suspension feeders results in such diseases being highly infective with a very small low-abundance refuge. In these systems, the body burden of pathogens and the relative importance between the release and the removal rate of pathogens in the host tissue or water column becomes paramount. Two processes are of potential consequence inhibiting epizootics. First, large water volumes above the benthic susceptible populations can function as a sink for pathogens. Second, unlike contact-based disease models in which an increase in the number of susceptible individuals in the population increases the likelihood of transmission and epizootic development, large populations of filter feeders can reduce this likelihood through the overfiltration of infective particles.",10.1002/ecs2.1286,"Ben-Horin, Tal/0000-0001-5123-2643; Bidegain, Gorka/0000-0002-2173-5140; Klinck, John/0000-0003-4312-5201",2150-8925,,,APR,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1286,

In the present study, levels of this ecologically meaningful compound were quantified in various abalone tissues, and in freshly spawned eggs. Tryptophan was the least abundant of 19 dissolved free amino acids (DFAAs) in ovary, testis, foot muscle, gill, stomach and hemolymph.

Natural rates of Trp release from eggs also were measured and correlated with fertility. Fertilization success peaked during an initial 30 min period (post-spawn), but decreased to nil over the next 50 min. Closely paralleling these events, Trp accumulated in seawater around freshly spawned eggs for the first 45 min (post-spawn) before decaying rapidly from solution. Older eggs stopped releasing Trp approximately when they became infertile, revealing a critical link between gamete physiology and chemical signaling. This apparent negative feedback loop did not arise from tryptophan oxidation, uptake by bacteria in seawater, or a degrading enzyme released by eggs. As a metabolic precursor critical to development of the larval nervous system, Trp could be an honest indicator of egg fitness for prospective sperm suitors.

Atomic force microscopy was used to explore the interaction of perlwapin with calcite crystals. Monomolecular layers of calcite crystals dissolve very slowly in deionized water and recrystallize in supersaturated calcium carbonate solution. When perlwapin was dissolved in the supersaturated calcium carbonate solution, growth of the crystal was inhibited immediately. Perlwapin molecules bound tightly to distinct step edges, preventing the crystal layers from growing. Using lower concentrations of perlwapin in a saturated calcium carbonate solution, we could distinguish native, active perlwapin molecules from denaturated ones.

Movement was negligible at a site where crevices were abundant, but extensive at a site without cervice space. At a site of limited available crevice space, the amount of movement increased as available crevice space decreased. In addition, the extent of movement was size dependent and movement was oriented in the direction of the approaching swell.

One such seafood is the Xishi abalone (Haliotis gigantea), which displays muscle color polymorphism wherein a small subset of individuals display orange coloration of muscles due to carotenoid enrichment. However, the metabolic basis for carotenoid accumulation has not been thoroughly investigated in marine mollusks. Here, GC-TOF-MS-based untargeted metabolite profiling was used to identify key pathways and metabolites involved in differential carotenoid accumulation in abalones with variable carotenoid contents. Cholesterol was the most statistically significant metabolite that differentiated abalones with orange muscles against those with common white muscles. This observation is likely due to the competitive interactions between cholesterol and carotenoids during cellular absorption. In addition, the accumulation of carotenoids was also related to fatty acid contents.

"Nguyen, TV; Alfaro, AC",Targeted metabolomics to investigate antimicrobial activity of itaconic acid in marine molluscs,2019,METABOLOMICS,15,7,,,97,"IntroductionItaconic acid (ITA) has recently been identified as an antimicrobial metabolite in mammalian immune cells. The presence of ITA was alsoreported in different tissues of marine molluscs, indicating its role as an endogenous metabolite of molluscs. In addition, the accumulation of ITA has been observed in different tissues of mussels following pathogen challenges. However, the concentration of ITA in mussel tissues and the possible role of this metabolite in the molluscan innate immune system remain unknown.ObjectivesThis study aims to quantitatively measure ITA levels in different tissues of marine mussels following an experimental challenge with Vibrio sp. DO1 isolate, and to identify the antimicrobial role of ITA in the innate immune system through the measurement of metabolic and immune alterations in tissues following the challenge.MethodsIn this study, adult Perna canaliculus mussels were experimentally challenged with a pathogenic Vibrio sp. DO1 isolate. The metabolite profiles of five different tissues, including mantle, gill, muscle, hepatopancreas and haemolymph were obtained, and levels of ITA in each tissue were characterized using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics approach. Flow cytometry was also employed to measure cell health parameters, including oxidative stress via reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, apoptosis via changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and haemocyte viability.ResultsThe ITA levels in mantle, gill, muscle and hepatopancreas tissues at 18-h post infection (hpi) with Vibrio sp. were 40.31, 41.71, 11.61 and 41.66ngmg(-1), respectively. In haemolymph, the level of ITA was significantly increased from 95.25ngml(-1) at 6 hpi to 174.36ngml(-1) at 18hpi and 572.12ngml(-1) at 60hpi. In line with the accumulation of ITA, we observed increased levels of metabolites within the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, anti-inflammatory metabolites and alterations of other metabolites associated with immune responses of the host. The flow cytometry analyses revealed increases in ROS production, apoptotic cells and decreases in cell viability.ConclusionsWe reported on the production of ITA in different tissues of P. canaliculus mussels challenged with a marine pathogen which confirmed ITA as an antimicrobial metabolite. The findings revealed insights into the biosynthesis of ITA and suggests its role in antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities in the innate immune system.

For red abalone (Haliotis rufescens), a large marine snail, the relationship between chemical signaling and fluid motion largely determines fertilization success. Egg-derived attractant plumes are dynamic, changing their size and shape in response to unique combinations of physical and chemical environmental features. Attractant plumes that promote sexual reproduction, however, are limited to a precise set of hydrodynamic conditions. Performance-maximizing shears are those that most closely match flows in native spawning habitats. Under conditions in which reproductive success is chronically limited by sperm availability, gametes are under selection for mechanisms that increase sperm-egg encounter. Here, chemoattraction is found to provide a cheap evolutionary alternative for enhancing egg target size without enlarging cytoplasmic and/or cell volume. Because egg signaling and sperm response may be tuned to meet specific fluid-dynamic constraints, shear could act as a critical selective pressure that drives gamete evolution and determines fitness.",10.1073/pnas.1018666108,,0027-8424,,,Aug-09,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1018666108,21788487

Prior work has shown that settlement in two shoreline echinoids (a sea urchin and a sand dollar) is unexpectedly sensitive to an environmental feature (intense fluid turbulence) that can be considered as a signal to larvae of their arrival in the neighbourhood of the hydrodynamically energetic habitats in which these taxa live as adults. Here, we used a comparative approach to explore the evolution of turbulence responsiveness in late-stage echinoid larvae. We examined three pairs of closely related sea urchins that differ in the energetic exposure of their adult habitats and found that larval responsiveness to turbulence was more pronounced in urchins that settle in more hydrodynamically exposed locations.

Specifically, the aquaculture of abalone and that of limpets are two key industries with striking similarities and importance within the context of food production and food security. In this review, the current knowledge of these two commercially important seafood species is explored for a comprehensive understanding of its aquaculture status. The various culture methods and systems, animal nutrition and necessary improvements are discussed for abalone and limpets, respectively. For abalone, the knowledge base is extensive and some reviews have been written to compile essential information regarding different aspects of this healthy industry. For limpets, there is a small collection of aquaculture literature, and this is, to the authors' knowledge, the first comprehensive review of the research. Our goal was to reveal, within the area of aquaculture research, the current status of both abalone and limpet industries while exposing their respective knowledge gaps for appropriate development of new technologies. With a firm understanding of these molluscs, the production of abalone and limpet will be sustainable for the long term.",10.1111/raq.12190,"Jha, Rajesh/0000-0002-2891-8353",1753-5123,1753-5131,,AUG,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/raq.12190,

Samples were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and hybridized at 40 A degrees C for 3 h using a TAMRA (5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine)-labeled probe (Rpt probe). Strain Ab1 could be clearly discriminated from other control bacteria (Enterococcus, Lactobacillus). Fluorescence signals of Rpt-positive bacteria were easily distinguished from any detectable background noise. Rpt-positive bacteria were detected in both probiotic-supplemented and control abalone; nevertheless, the number of Rpt-positive bacteria in probiotic-supplemented abalone was two orders of magnitude higher than in controls. Furthermore, the mean number of Rpt-positive bacteria (probiotic-supplemented abalone) in the gut-attached section was also two orders of magnitude higher than in the free-living section. Rpt-positive micro-colonies (MCs) were observed by thin-section FISH analysis only in probiotic-supplemented abalone, and these MCs were observed in contact with intestinal epithelial cells. These results indicate that the probiotic Pediococcus sp. strain Ab1 can colonize or adhere to the abalone digestive tract in numbers sufficient for therapeutic effects.

Three dietary treatments were used, and consisted of 100% of the flagellate Isochrysis sp. clone T-ISO (treatment I), 70% T-ISO + 30% kelp meal (IK), and 70% T-ISO + 30% cod liver oil (IO). Ingestion rates (IR) were also assessed during the first month of the experiment in clams from treatment I. The IR exhibited by adult P. globosa remained relatively constant during the evaluation period (0.027-0.035% BW d(-1)). In contrast, significant time-and diet-dependent effects were observed in the live weight of conditioned organisms, those from treatment I showing the maximum values (1369 to 1533 g) after 7 weeks, followed by IO and IK. Lowest BWC (39.0 to 42.1%) coincided with the timing of maximum live weight and female gonad weight. Female and male gonad weights increased 2-fold and 1.4-fold respectively within the first month. Gonads from the IK treatment tended to be lighter than those from diets I or IO. Significant time, diet, and time x diet effects were observed on the flesh weight of the organisms, with higher values on the 8th week for organisms from treatment I. Neither CI nor GI was significantly affected by the test factors. Viable oocytes were detected only after 6 weeks of conditioning. Overall, the ration demanded by adults of P. globosa is relatively low, and adults can be successfully matured in the laboratory within a period of 6 to 8 weeks with Isochrysis sp. clone T-ISO as the sole diet, and an effective accumulated temperature of ca. 230 degree-days.

The biomineralization process takes place in the extrapallial space, between inner shell and outer mantle epithelium, and is believed to be under the control of calcium-binding proteins and hormonal factors such as calcitonin-related molecules (CGRP-like peptides). Epithelial cells from the mantle are responsible from the secretion of matrix molecules whereas hemocytes are involved in ion transportation during shell formation and regeneration. To understand the biochemical and cellular events implied in the biomineralization process, we developed primary cell cultures from the nacreous gastropod Haliotis tuberculata. Mantle cells as well as hemocyte cell cultures were successfully maintained in vitro and evaluated for their viability and proliferation using semiautomated assays. The effect of calcitonin-related molecules (h-CGRP) on cellular activity and proliferation was evaluated in those primary cell Cultures. The results indicate that human-CGRP modulates the activity of both mantle cells and hemocytes and increases carbonic anhydrase activity in vitro. These results are consistent with those obtained in vitro, supporting the hypothesis that CGRP-like molecules control the activity of target cells involved in the biomineralization process.",10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[887:CRTAOM]2.0.CO;2,"AUZOUX-BORDENAVE, Stephanie/0000-0001-7429-1654",0730-8000,1943-6319,,SEP,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[887:CRTAOM]2.0.CO;2,

These include compliance enforcement, the management and conservation of marine organisms, and commercial quality control. Abalone poaching worldwide and illegal trade in abalone products have increased mainly because of the attractive prices obtained and caused a sharp decline in stocks. Alleged poachers have been acquitted because of lack of evidence to correctly identify species. Therefore, a robust method is required that would identify tissue of abalone origin to species level. The aim of this study was to develop immunologic techniques, using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, to identify 10 different abalone species and subspecies from South Africa, the United States, Australia, and Japan. The combination of 3 developed monoclonal antibodies to South African abalone (Haliotis midae) enabled differentiation between most of the 10 species including the subspecies H. diversicolor supertexta and H. diversicolor diversicolor. In a novel approach, using antibodies of patients with allergy to abalone, the differentiation of additional subspecies, H. discus discus and H. discus hannai, was possible.

The Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) Larvae were kept under a 12/12 h light/dark photoperiod (DD) in order to determine the effects of ALAN on embryonic development. To simulate the street lighting conditions at night, the artificial light was switched on from 18:00 until midnight (AD) or until 06:00 the next day (ND). Moreover, Groups AD and ND had a considerably greater hatching success rate and metamorphosis rate than Group DD (P < 0.05), whereas Group DD had a significantly longer hatching period and course to complete the metamorphosis of the larvae (P < 0.05). Transcriptomic analyses showed that members of Groups AD and DD had considerably higher expression levels of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, spliceosome function, and the mRNA surveillance pathway. Prostaglandin B2, L-pal-mitoylcarnitine, stearic acid, palmitic acid, leukotriene C4, and arachidonic acid were screened by non-targeted metabolomics as differential metabolic markers that played a vital role in the response of larvae to different ALAN conditions. Multi-omics correlation analysis suggested that five pathways related to fatty acid synthesis, catabolism, and metabolism, such as biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid metabolism, were enriched in each comparison. Further quantitative analysis showed that compared to Group DD, 33 out of 50 fatty acids were upregulated in Group AD, and the levels of almost all fatty acids were increased in Group ND, which in turn suggested that fatty acids played a vital role in the physiological response of larvae to illumination changes. The findings of this work were significant for the unbiased and full-scale assessment of the ecological effects of ALAN, as well as the structural stability of the marine benthic community.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111472,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,JAN,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111472,
"Gorfine, HK",Post-harvest weight loss has important implications for abalone quota management,2001,JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH,20,2,795,802,,"Regulations forming part of the abalone quota management system in Victoria, Australia require that abalone processors notify fisheries authorities of quantities of abalone consigned from commercial divers within 25 h of landing. The regulations also require that the abalone are to be landed whole in the shell, and transported and stored in sealed bins until confirmation of official notification. Although the bins cannot be opened before notification, the 25-h limit for notification provides a window of opportunity to make potential gains through weight loss in those abalone destined for canning. This arises because notified weights, rather than weights estimated upon landing, are used to decrement the quota allocations of individual divers, I investigated the potential for post-harvest weight loss by subjecting abalone to three experimental treatments selected to simulate a range of possible transport and regimes. My results demonstrate that substantial weight loss can occur in whole abalone during both ambient and refrigerated storage. Loss of weight in abalone during storage results from the release of water and body fluid associated with physiological responses to hypoxic stress caused by exposure to air. In Victoria, about 60% of the landed catch is used to produce canned product. Because of the observed weight losses during storage, divers supplying abalone for canning have to harvest more abalone to achieve their quotas than those supplying abalone for live export. Losses in weight of 10-20% observed during this study equate to a harvest of 6-12% (350,000-700,000 abalone) more than the total allowable catches. Harvesting these additional quantities of abalone may exceed desired fishing mortalities for long-term population sustainability. If beach weights were deducted from quotas, then this problem could be resolved.",,"Gorfine, Harry/0000-0001-6933-3389",0730-8000,,,DEC,,

A positive response to the beverage of crude royal jelly was not observed in normal volunteers. A positive diagnosis of anaphylaxis due to royal jelly was made based on the positive prick test, systemic clinical symptoms and the negative prick tests in healthy volunteers. Moreover, the patient had no symptoms when taking lemon and orange, which were present as essences in the crude royal jelly beverage, and also had no response to honey after anaphylaxis.

Trophic level correlates with production volume (tons/yr) and with unit value (US$/ton) in aquaculture but not in capture fisheries (FAO's fisheries data). Apparently, sustainability and economics in aquaculture both depend on ecological efficiency, i.e., the use of resources and the production of waste. Species feeding low in the food chain use efficiently the natural resources. Each level up the food chain inflates costs related to the use of resources, the production of waste and the maintenance of water quality. This effect has further repercussions on the economics of aquaculture: (1) cost influences profit and unit price, and (2) price influences demand and market share.

Here, we compare the energetics of early development of a tropical ophiuroid, Ophiocoma alexandri, and a temperate to tropical echinoid, Arbacia punctulata, two species with similarly sized eggs. Measurements of respiration and constituent analyses were performed on eggs and unfed larvae of both species. Members of both species showed an increase in oxygen consumption during morphogenesis followed by a lower, static rate once morphogenesis was complete (3 d for O. alexandri and 1.3 d for A. punctulata). Compared to the echinoid larvae, the ophiuroid larvae developed more slowly and had peak respiration rates that were 3.1x lower. Eggs of O. alexandri contained significantly more protein and significantly less triacylglycerol than eggs of A. punctulata. Energy utilization, as calculated via respiration measurements, closely matched decreases in energy content from the eggs to larvae as measured with biochemical constituent assays. Larvae of A. punctulata used 1.4x more energy to reach the pluteus stage than larvae of O. alexandri, and used 4x more energy during the first 9 d of larval life. These data suggest that echinoid larvae require more energy to develop to the feeding stage than ophiuroid larvae, and likewise have higher requirements for maintenance metabolism. Ophiuroid larvae may be more tolerant of low food levels due to their very low metabolic rates, but this advantage may be offset by their slower rate of development.",10.1111/j.1744-7410.2012.00277.x,"Moran, Amy/0000-0002-0604-5096",1077-8306,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7410.2012.00277.x,

It has 930-bp full length with a 717-bp open reading frame (01117), encoding 239 amino acids. The AbTNF-alpha amino acid sequence shows the characteristic TNF family signature, N-terminal transmembrane domain consisting of a hydrophobic amino acid cluster and cell attachment sequence at (155)RGD(157). Phylogenic analysis results showed that AbTNF-alpha is more related to the invertebrate Ciona savignyi TNF superfamily ligand member (CsTL). Quantitative real-time PCR expression results showed that AbTNF-alpha was constitutively expressed in both immune and non-immune tissues in a tissue specific manner. The highest constitutive expression was in the gill tissue with a 1.5-fold compared to hemocytes expression. The AbTNF-alpha mRNA expression in gill tissue was monitored in vivo stimulated by a mixture of pathogenic bacteria (Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahemolyticus, and Lysteria monocytogenes), viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The AbTNF-alpha expression was significantly (p < 0.05) induced by bacteria, VHSV and LPS compared to the control animals.

Previously, atomic force microscopy demonstrated that abalone nacre proteins bind to growing step edges and to specific crystallographic faces of calcite, suggesting that inhibition of calcite growth may be one of the molecular processes required for growth of the less thermodynamically stable aragonite phase. Previous experiments were done with protein mixtures. To elucidate the role of single proteins, we have characterized two proteins isolated from the aragonitic component of nacre of the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens. These proteins, purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, are designated AP7 and AP24 (aragonitic protein of molecular weight 7 kDa and 24 kDa, respectively). Degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to N-terminal and internal peptide sequences were used to amplify cDNA clones by a polymerase chain reaction from a mantle cDNA library; the deduced primary amino acid sequences are presented. Preliminary crystal growth experiments demonstrate that protein fractions enriched in AP7 and AP24 produced CaCO3 crystals with morphology distinct from crystals grown in the presence of the total mixture of soluble aragonite-specific proteins. Peptides corresponding to the first 30 residues of the N-terminal sequences of both AP7 and AP24 were generated. The synthetic peptides frustrate the progression of step edges of a growing calcite surface, indicating that sequence features within the N-termini of AP7 and AP24 include domains that interact with CaCO3. CD analyses demonstrate that the N-terminal peptide sequences do not possess significant percentages of alpha-helix or beta-strand secondary structure in solution. Instead, in both the presence and absence of Ca(II), the peptides retain unfolded conformations that may facilitate protein-mineral interaction.

The distribution of maximum length provides important information for establishing a legal minimum length (LML). Legal minimum length is commonly used to optimize yield and/or reproductive potential in abalone populations. Although choice of LML is generally based on deterministic estimates of average values of growth parameters, there is strong evidence in abalone growth data that distributions of maximum length in abalone populations have large variances and proportions of abalone that cannot attain the LML. However; deterministic estimates give no indication of the proportion of individuals that may or may not attain a specific LML. Consequently, deterministic estimates of growth can be misleading and may result in setting inappropriate LMLs. Length-increment data from tagged individuals in three H. rubra populations in Victoria, Australia were analyzed using new stochastic versions of the Gompertz model reparameterized for tagging data. Outputs from the stochastic Gompertz model for tagging data include distributions of I, that show the proportion of abalone in each studied population that were unlikely to attain the LML and enter the stock. It is presently unknown whether this lever of protection will ensure long-term sustainability. The proportion conserved may also be viewed as lost yield to the fishery. If the proportion of abalone required to provide sufficient egg production for sustaining a particular population is known, then the stochastic Gompertz model for tagging data provides additional information to select an appropriate LML that balances reproductive output against yield to the fishery.",,"Gorfine, Harry/0000-0001-6933-3389",0730-8000,,,DEC,,

Various word-based questionnaires for direct measurement exist and an emoji variant was recently proposed. Herein, emotion words are replaced with emoji conveying a range of emotions. Further assessment of emoji questionnaires is needed to establish their relevance in food-related consumer research. Methodological research contributes hereto and in the present research the effects of question wording and response format are considered. Specifically, a web study was conducted with Chinese consumers (n = 750) using four seafood names as stimuli (mussels, lobster, squid and abalone). Emotional associations were elicited using 33 facial emoji. Explicit reference to how would you feel? in the question wording changed product emoji profiles minimally. Consumers selected only a few emoji per stimulus when using CATA (check-all-that-apply) questions, and layout of the CATA question had only a small impact on responses. A comparison of CATA questions with forced yes/no questions and RATA (rate-all-that-apply) questions revealed an increase in frequency of emoji use for yes/no questions, but not a corresponding improvement in sample discrimination. For the stimuli in this research, which elicited similar emotional associations, RATA was probably the best methodological choice, with 8.5 emoji being used per stimulus, on average, and increased sample discrimination relative to CATA (12% vs. 6-8%). The research provided additional support for the potential of emoji surveys as a method for measurement of emotional associations to foods and beverages and began contributing to development of guidelines for implementation.",10.1016/j.foodres.2017.04.028,"Jaeger, Sara R./0000-0002-4960-5233; Ares, Gaston/0000-0002-0565-8835",0963-9969,1873-7145,,SEP,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.04.028,28784478

Laevistrombus canarium, also known as dog conch, is a marine gastropod mollusk widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific region. It is an economically crucial species; however, its population has been declining due to overfishing and overexploitation. In this study, the suitable salinity for juvenile L. canarium was between 20 and 35 parts per thousand. Diatoms and biological detritus by using flow-water from the fish pool were the most favorable diets for newly metamorphosed and 10 mm juveniles. In the polyculture experiment, L. canarium was cultured with whiteleg shrimp, tilapia, small abalone, purple sea urchin, and collector urchin. Better growth was found in all co-culture groups except with whiteleg shrimp. We also found that the polyculture system with or without substrates significantly affected the growth of juveniles. Additionally, we observed that water temperature was the most crucial factor for growth and survival; a water temperature of less than 10 degrees C might cause the death of L. canarium. We have proposed a novel polyculture and water-flow method for mass production of L. canarium and evaluated the feasibility and benefits of polyculture with other species.

In addition, mass strandings leave beached individuals exposed to air. The effects of exposure to air on undersized J. lalandii (carapace lengths 60-74 mm) were analysed for a range of exposure periods (0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 300 min) that realistically spanned conditions experienced during fishing operations or following mass strandings. Four approaches were used to assess the effects: (1) changes in the speed and nature of escape responses; (2) frequencies of capture by a predator; (3) changes in haemolymph chemistry; (4) growth rates. The time-to-first-response of lobsters after being returned to water was correlated with duration of exposure to air, ranging from 0.2 s by unexposed (control) lobsters to 13 min by individuals exposed for 300 min. The number of tail flips, the distance swum after release and the efficacy of escape from an octopus also decreased significantly as exposure to air increased. A progressive decrease of haemolymph pH from 7.5 in control lobsters to 6.89 in those exposed for 300 min indicated increasing metabolic acidosis. Haemolymph L-lactate concentration increased linearly with emersion time from 1.07 mu mol/ml in controls to 18.5 mu mol/ml in lobsters exposed for 300 min, reflecting at least a partial switch to anaerobic metabolism. Overall, these physiological effects diminished the lobsters' response time and ability to escape, leaving them vulnerable to predation. No effects of exposure to air on subsequent growth rate were detected. Due to the severity of the effects of prolonged air-exposure, existing contingency plans to rescue lobsters after mass strandings will be futile unless they can be returned to the sea rapidly.

Recently, prominent blooms of Cochlodinium have occurred in central and southern California (20042008), and Cochlodinium cells are now routinely observed in microscopical analysis of algal assemblages from Californian coastal waters. The first documented economic loss due to a Cochlodinium bloom in California occurred in Monterey Bay and resulted in the mortality of commercially farmed abalone. Increasing occurrences of Cochlodinium blooms, the fact that these cells preserve poorly using standard techniques, and the difficulty of identifying preserved specimens using morphological criteria make Cochlodinium species prime candidates for the development of a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) approach. The 18S rDNA gene sequenced from Cochlodinium cells obtained from California coastal waters, as well as GenBank sequences of Cochlodinium, were used to design and test a Molecular Beacon (R) approach.

We cloned and analyzed the expression pattern and genomic structure of the MnSOD gene of pearl oyster Pinctada fucata, hereafter designated as PoMnSOD. The full-length PoMnSOD cDNA was 1080 bp in length and consisted of a 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of 222 bp, a 3'-UTR of 318 bp with a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) at 15 nucleotides upstream of the poly (A) tail, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 540 bp encoding a polypeptide of 180 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 20.4 kDa and a predicted pI of 6.72. Sequence analysis showed that PoMnSOD contained MnSOD family signatures F(44)NGGGHLNH(52), I(97)QGSGWGWLA(106) and D(138)VWEHAYY(145), four conserved residues for manganese metal binding (H-4, H-52, D-138 and H-142), and two potential N-glycosylation sites (N-33 and N-51). Homology analysis revealed that PoMnSOD shared 47.6-55.9% identity and 57.4-65.6% similarity to the other known PoMnSOD amino acid sequences. PoMnSOD genomic DNA was 5040 bp in length and contained three exons and two introns, which was a tripartite organization and coincided with the consensus GT-AG splicing rule. PoMnSOD promoter contained the various transcription factors associated with the immune modulation and stress responses. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that PoMnSOD was constitutively expressed in all detected tissues, and PoMnSOD mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated in intestine, mantle, gills, digestive gland and haemocytes after Vibrio alginolyticus injection. These results suggested that PoMoSOD was an acute-response protein involved in the innate immune responses of pearl oyster, and provided general information about the mechanisms of innate immune defense against bacterial infection in pearl oyster.

This study estimates the biomass of E. maxima available for harvesting, investigates the effects of harvesting on the recovery of kelp and on the benthic understorey biota, and tests an alternative method of harvesting kelp by cutting off only fronds rather than whole plants. Estimates from diver sampling between May 1992 and November 1994 and infra-red maps indicate an E. maxima biomass at Danger Point of 22 973 tons fresh mass in 336 ha of kelp beds, insufficient to sustain projected abalone feed requirements in the area if harvesting is done in the traditional manner of cutting the stipes. However, sufficient frond material may be harvested sustainably if only fronds are cut, at distances 20-30 cm from the bases of fronds. Cutting at 10 cm from the base significantly reduced regrowth rates, and there was little regrowth after cutting at 2 cm. Yield per unit effort was higher for a four-month interval between harvesting them for one-, two- and three-month intervals. Two years after harvesting whole plants (in two 100 x 20 in lanes), biomass and density of kelp had recovered (similar in control and harvested lanes), and there were no detectable differences in the understorey communities, as measured by detrended correspondence analysis. Although harvesting of whole kelp has a minimal effect on the understorey biota and kelp itself recovers within two years, selective cutting of fronds allows plants to remains alive and produce a higher yield.

Using white abalone Haliotis sorenseni, a critically marine broadcast spawner with spatially patchy remnant populations in southern California (USA), as an example, we developed an individual-based model that describes density-, temperature-, and habitat-dependent biological processes. Using the model, we evaluated hypothetical stocking strategies including spatial distribution and size of stocked abalone and initial density of resident abalone. Our results show that stocking strategies for the modeled white abalone populations benefited most when stocking locations had resident abalone and when stocked abalone were large in size. We also examined the potential influence of the spatial structure of the habitat (i. e. percentage of suitable habitat and spatial distribution of habitat cells), ocean warming, and poaching on restoration outcomes. We found that the percentage of suitable habitat greatly affected population dynamics, with more suitable habitat resulting in a slower decline in population growth and recruitment, as well as a higher and more stable proportion of intermediate-sized abalone. The spatial distribution (random or clustered) of habitat cells and of stocked abalone had less of an impact on model outcomes. Elevated temperature and poaching both had strong negative impacts on abalone population growth in the model.

While marine reserves are commonly used to mitigate risks to marine populations, the duration, size, location and larval connectivity needed for a reserve to help conserve genetic resources is still poorly understood. Here, we examine the effects of fishing, reserves, and restocking on the genetic diversity of 10 populations from central Baja California, Mexico, and Southern California, USA. We demonstrate that each population shows characteristic genetic signatures according to recent management decisions. We found high allelic diversity, particularly rare alleles, a larger effective population size and a lack of a recent genetic bottleneck in pink abalones within a small (0.8 km(2)), recently established (5 years) reserve in Baja California, compared to other fished sites after a climatic bottleneck. Higher diversity may result from the presence of older animals in the reserve. Due to its location, the reserve may also act as an important hub connecting distant populations via larval dispersal. In contrast, a population from California showed genetic isolation, loss of allelic diversity and high relatedness, consistent with the collapse of fisheries in the 1990s and their lack of recovery thereafter. In addition, a fished area in Baja California with a history of restocking for over a decade showed an increase in frequency of related individuals and high genetic differentiation from nearby sites that were consistent with the production of larvae from a few adults in the laboratory.

Data on the length-structure of the catch provide important information on exploited stocks, but representative sub-sampling is difficult to achieve, especially where numerous licence holders fish over large areas. This study evaluates the potential for routinely collected, commercial, weight-grade data to overcome this challenge and enhance assessment of the Western Zone blacklip (Haliotis rubra) and greenlip (Haliotis laevigata) abalone fisheries in South Australia. Current weight-grade data for blacklip abalone are inaccurate. However, the accuracy, rigour and consistency of the data for greenlip abalone confirm they are sufficiently reliable for aiding fishery assessments on this species. The greenlip abalone data were highly representative of the catch and the fishery and have been obtained in a consistent manner for >20 years. Changes in the composition of the grades in the catch provide a meaningful measure of change in the harvested stock. Similarly, measures of mean weight and number harvested, derived from the weight-grade data, are valuable as additional indices of stock status. These attributes substantially enhance the credibility of these data for use in assessing changes in stock status through time, and suggest these data should be used to supplement current assessments of this species. The value of the weight-grade data would increase substantially if the resolution was improved by using automated weighing and grading systems. The analysis of weight-grade data, routinely collected from numerous fisheries, is likely to benefit their assessment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Although microgeographic genetic structure among sites on SN was weak and not statistically significant, heterozygosity varied among sites, with diversity decreasing from west to east. In addition, investigation among cohorts showed that adults were genetically differentiated among island locations, whereas no differences among juveniles were detected. Genetic differentiation between adult and juvenile abalones was detected at SC but not SM or SN. These data are generally consistent with local recruitment augmented by relatively more gene flow among island populations than among island and mainland populations, and possible selection acting on immigrant recruits.

Therefore, in this study, we investigated anti-adipogenic effects of alpha AL14 on preadipocyte, 3T3-L1. Obesity is an imbalance in metabolism caused by excessive energy intake or reduced energy consumption, and fat accumulates in the body, which causes chronic disease such as high pressure, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Inhibition of adipogenesis has been focused on as a strategy for treating metabolic disease including diabetes and obesity. In order to confirm the effect on adipocyte differentiation, alpha AL14 was treated while inducing differentiation from preadipocytes into mature adipocytes. We observed that alpha AL14 potently and dose-dependently suppressed accumulation of lipid droplets during mature adipocyte differentiation. alpha AL14 also down-regulated the expression of key adipogenic regulator such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1). In addition, alpha AL14 diminished the insulin-stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling and its downstream factors that promote adipogenesis by inducing the expression of PPAR gamma, such as mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3 beta) and forkhead box (Fox) transcription factors, which may reduce glucose uptake in response to insulin and lipid accumulation. These results indicated that alpha AL14 suppresses adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation depending on multiple mechanisms. In summary, alpha AL14 could be a novel inhibitor of adipogenesis and may have applications for the treatment of obesity.",10.1007/s10989-021-10220-0,,1573-3149,1573-3904,,SEP,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10989-021-10220-0,

The deduced amino acid sequences of MamMnSOD showed high sequence homology to mitochondrial MnSODs from crustaceans. Several motifs, including three mitochondrial MnSOD signatures, amino acid residues responsible for coordinating the manganese, and the putative active center, were almost completely conserved in the deduced amino acid sequences of MamMnSOD. The mRNA expression of MamMnSOD in the tissues of heart, liver, spleen, kidney, muscle, intestine, and gill was examined by quantitative real-time PCR; the highest expression was in the liver. Transcription of MamMnSOD was kinetically modulated in response to nitrite stress in liver and gill tissues. The purified recombinant MamMnSOD showed potent antioxidant activity. Polyclonal antibodies generated from the recombinant product of MamMnSOD were used to specifically identify the native protein in liver of M. amblycephala.

The present study therefore measured the effect of age on various reproductive parameters of T. heterouncinata from cultured abalone Haliotis midae. Age did not have a significant effect on body size, fecundity or rate at which eggs were laid. However, age had an affect on the proportion of the population that was brooding offspring, because a significantly lower percentage of the youngest age-group was brooding eggs or young, in comparison with the older groups. T heterouncinata are long-lived, surviving for over four years on abalone farms and can therefore spread their reproductive effort over an extended period, instead of restricting it to a limited period during its early life.

An intensive, biofiltered recirculating integrated system producing fish and seaweed on a semi-commercial scale was evaluated with respect to production and to nutrient and heat budgets. The system consisted of abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) and sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) tanks, an intensive fishpond (Sparus aurata), and a three-stage Ulva lactuca biofilter, which cleaned and recirculated 50% of the effluent back to the fishpond. To preserve water heat, the shellfish and fishpond units were both covered with greenhouses; the biofilter unit was covered with a greenhouse only during winter. Seaweed yield was variable and averaged 94 and 117 g m(-2) day(-1) (fresh weight) in periods with and without greenhouse cover, respectively. Protein content of U. lactuca averaged above 34% of dry weight. The biofiltration of only 50% of the water through the seaweed biofilter reduced the export of dissolved nutrients to the environment by nearly 30%. Peak ammonia excretion by the moming-fed fish coincided with maximum seaweed light-dependent ammonia uptake and concentrations of ammonia in the fishpond remained within nontoxic limits. Also, daytime photosynthesis of U. lactuca (uptake of CO2) met fish respiration (production of CO2), thus balancing fishpond pH levels within safe limits regarding ammonia toxicity. Daytime oxygen demand by the fish was partially met by the photosynthetically generated oxygen. Before covering the biofilter with a greenhouse, it lost much heat, reducing the temperature in the fishpond. Following the greenhouse covering of the biofilter, heat loss ceased and consequently the fishpond temperature was raised. Recirculation through the biofilter improved system sustainability; it reduced water use, lowered negative environmental impact, and maintained stable and safe water quality conditions in the fishpond.

Molluscs reflect the degree of environmental contamination and are the most useful bioindicator tools. The study of modulation of immune system or immunomodulation in marine molluscs has become one of the privileged ways for evaluating the physiological effects of environmental factors. Physiological responses of molluscs to environmental stresses could be mediated by haemocytes. These cells are continually exposed to the external environment due to the open circulatory system of molluscs and are affected by pollutants. In fact, several studies showed the effects of different environmental contaminants on haemocyte functions (viability, phagocytosis, ROS production) as well as on proteins involved in cytoskeletal structure maintenance using the in vitro approaches. In ecotoxicology, in vitro approach is an alternative to animal testing due to the reduced use of experimental animals, low cost and rapid performance. Although several studies showed the importance of using in vitro cell models to determine the effects of different environmental contaminants on haemocyte parameters in marine molluscs, a few reviews highlight these effects.

During 6 h of experimental anoxia, energy for both muscles was provided by arginine phosphate and co-fermentation of glycogen and aspartate. Glycolysis in the shell adductor muscle led mainly to the formation of the novel end product tauropine; D-lactate production predominated in the foot. This pattern is consistent with observed enzymatic profiles in the two muscles and with the equilibrium constants of the respective enzymes, tauropine and D-lactate dehydrogenase. Recovery from anaerobiosis was characterized by a rapid return of the phosphagen pool and the energy charge to the aerobic state.

"Lebata-Ramos, MJHL",Molluscan aquaculture in the Philippines: a review,2023,AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL,31,5,2977,3001,,"Molluscs are among the most valuable resources of the Philippines, an archipelagic country of 7,107 islands bounded by 36,000 km of coastline and 26.6 million ha of coastal waters. In 2020, production from mussels and oysters alone valued at PhP1.552 billion. As primary sources of food and livelihood for marginalized fisherfolk, they are considered important in food security, nutrition, and poverty alleviation. Nevertheless, for almost a century, mollusc culture remained small-scale, with most fish farmers investing in non-fed species, like mussels and oysters. Moreover, mollusc culture in the country is still dependent on wild sources of seed stocks, making production unsustainable and unreliable. This dependence on the wild seed stocks will continue until the issue of the lack of commercial-scale hatcheries or the limited capacity of existing hatcheries to produce seeds, both for top and emerging mollusc aquaculture species, is resolved. Although technologies from broodstock management to post-harvest are available in some species, the lack of capital and the limited government support limit these artisanal fishers from doing large commercial-scale culture. This paper summarizes what has been done and published on the leading mollusc species cultured in the Philippines. Future research activities may be designed based on the research gaps to refine available technologies and develop new ones to improve culture production. The lack of or limited relevant information on the viable economics of the different culture techniques at different culture phases, the limited availability of post-harvest technologies, and the sparse or lack of genetic information for these leading mollusc species are among the gaps that need to be addressed.",10.1007/s10499-023-01120-9,"Lebata-Ramos, Ma.

The production of annual farmed small abalone in Taiwan, once the highest in the world, has dramatically decreased in the past 15 years, and currently, the industry is close to collapse. Understanding the genetic diversity of small abalone and developing stock identification methods will be useful for genetic breeding, restoring collapsed stocks, managing stocks, and preventing illegal trade. We investigated 307 cultured and wild individuals from Taiwan, Japan, and Bali Island (Indonesia) by using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. Network analysis of mtDNA COI gene sequences revealed that the individuals collected from Taiwan, Japan, and Indonesia could be identified, and showed significant genetic divergence. In addition, the Indonesian population (Haliotis diversicolor squamata) was significantly different from the other populations and might need to be considered a separate species. We discovered a single nucleotide polymorphism marker in the mtDNA COI gene that can be used to distinguish the Taiwan population from the Japan population. We also developed a polymerase chain reactionrestriction fragment length polymorphism method for rapid detection. Furthermore, we could identify the cultured stocks, wild population, and hybrid stocks by using 6 microsatellites and amplified fragment length polymorphism. This study contributes useful tools for stock identification and the production of high-disease resistant small abalone strains (Japan x Taiwan or Taiwan x Japan). Efforts should be made to avoid unintentional random genetic mixing of the Taiwan population with the Japan population and subsequent breakdown of population differentiation, which impair local adaptation of the Taiwan wild population.

Here we successfully cloned and characterized two Delta(5) Fads in abalone (Haliotis discus hannai Ino). Two Delta(5) Fad mRNA transcripts, Hdhfad1 (GQ 470626) and Hdhfad2 (GQ 466197), were found in abalone sharing 96.82% similarity for cDNA sequence and 96.58% similarity for their deduced amino acid sequences.

The starfish outbreak in coastal areas will lead to severe economic losses in aquaculture and damage the ecological environment. However, the current monitoring methods are still artificial, time-consuming, and laborious. This study used an underwater observation platform with multiple sensors to observe the starfish outbreak in Weihai, Shandong Province. The platform could collect the temperature, salinity, depth, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, other water quality data, and underwater video data. Based on these data, the paper proposed an early warning model for starfish prevalence (EWSP) based on multi-sensor fusion. A deep learning-based object detection method extracts time-series information on the number of starfish from underwater video data. For the extracted starfish quantity information, the model uses the k-means clustering algorithm to divide the starfish prevalence level into four levels: no prevalence, mild prevalence, medium prevalence, and high prevalence. Correlation analysis concluded that the water quality factors most closely related to the starfish prevalence level are temperature and salinity. Therefore, the selected water quality factor and the number of historical starfish are inputted. The future starfish prevalence level of the starfish outbreak is used as an output to train the BP (back propagation) neural network to build EWSP based on multi-sensor fusion. Experiments show that the accuracy rate of this model is 97.26%, whose precision meets the needs of early warning for starfish outbreaks and has specific application feasibility.",10.3389/fmars.2023.1167191,,,2296-7745,,Jun-15,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1167191,

Using a kaupapa-Mori approach and culturally appropriate social science methods, cultural values of the Mt kahawai fishery were shared. The Identified Cultural Influence (ICI) index determined if kahawai is a cultural keystone species (CKS) for TWAH/NH. TWAH/NH have developed distinct, centuries-old wisdom, protocols and practices through their interactions with the kahawai. The fishery contributes to their identity and the ICI results suggest that kahawai is TWAH/NH's CKS. Indigenous knowledge and management systems can provide sustainable management practices improving how cultural values connected to fisheries are enhanced. We recommend culturally appropriate information sharing and analysis methods used here, for efficiently describing the cultural significance of fisheries.

Identifying the Wnt signaling pathway in abalone could provide a basis for elucidating growth and development mechanisms and improving quality. Objective To identify the number, protein physicochemical properties, gene structure, phylogenetic analysis, and expression profiles of the Wnt gene family in abalone. Methods A comprehensive genome-wide analysis was performed to identify the Wnt gene family in the genomes of three abalone species (Haliotis discus hannai, H. rubra, and H. rufescens). Results Ten single-copy Wnt genes were identified in each abalone species, suggesting that the number of Wnt genes was relatively conserved in Haliotis. Eight Wnt gene subfamilies, including Wnt1, Wnt4, Wnt5, Wnt6, Wnt7, Wnt10, Wnt16, and WntA, are present in all three species. Each abalone species contains two species-specific subfamilies (Wnt9 and Wnt11 in H. discus hannai, Wnt2 and Wnt11 in H. rubra, and Wnt2 and Wnt9 in H. rufescens), reflecting polymorphisms of the Wnt genes in Haliotis. Interestingly, gastropods are characterised by the loss of Wnt8, suggesting a potential evolutionary specificity in gastropods. As expected, Wnt3 is absent in all protostomes, including the abalone. In addition, spatio-temporal expression profiling revealed differential expression levels of the Wnt genes at different developmental stages and in different tissues of H. discus hannai. HdWnt5 and HdWntA might participate in several processes during larval development stages, including germ layer formation and body axis elongation. HdWnt5 may be involved in eye and tentacle development. HdWnt10 may be related to muscle development, and HdWnt6 may be involved in shell formation in abalone. Conclusion To our knowledge, the results of this study, which is the first genome-wide investigation of the Wnt gene family in abalone, lay the groundwork for future research on the evolution and function of the Wnt gene family in Gastropoda.",10.1007/s13258-024-01579-7,,1976-9571,2092-9293,,DEC,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13258-024-01579-7,39397130

However, studies exploring the gonadal development and regulatory mechanisms of Haliotis discus hannai are limited. This study aimed to explore whether the vasa gene acted as a molecular marker for germ cells. Initially, the vasa gene was successfully cloned using the cDNA-end rapid amplification technique. The cloned gene had a 2478-bp-long open reading frame and encoded 825 amino acids. Then, a recombinant expression vector was constructed based on the Vasa protein, and an 87-kDa recombinant protein was prepared. Subsequently, a polyclonal antibody was prepared using the purified recombinant protein. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed the titer of the antibody to be >= 512 K. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Vasa was widely expressed in oogonia, Stage I oocytes, spermatogonia, and primary spermatocytes. The specific expression of Vasa in the hermaphroditic gonads of abalone was assessed using western blotting to investigate the effects of different photoperiods (12 L:12D, 24 L:0D, 18 L:6D, and 6 L:18D) on the gonadal development of abalone (P P < 0.05), with higher expression levels observed in the ovarian proliferative and spermary maturing stages compared with other developmental stages (P P < 0.05). Additionally, Vasa exhibited the highest expression in the spermary and ovary under a photoperiod of 18 L:6D (P P < 0.05). These data demonstrated the key role of Vasa in developing germ cells in abalone. They shed light upon the molecular mechanism through which the photoperiod influenced Vasa expression and regulated gonadal development in abalone. The findings might provide theoretical references for analyzing the differentiation pattern of abalone germ cells and the genetic improvement and conservation of germplasm resources.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.134449,,0141-8130,1879-0003,,OCT,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.134449,39098680

In this study, 3D printing technology was employed to use the abundant calcium sources and bioactive substances in Aba to enhance the osteoinductive and remineralization capacity of materials in implants for bone regeneration. The novel hybrid scaffolds were successfully 3D-printed from polycaprolactone (PCL), which has good toughness and processability, doped with powdered Aba. When the Aba particle doping was increased from 0 to 15%, the physicochemical properties of PCL were virtually unchanged, while the surfaces of scaffolds became rough, and Aba particles were gradually exposed. The Aba/PCL scaffolds had an interconnected pore structure with a pore size of approximately 200 mu m and over 50% porosity, which was convenient for the transport of nutrients. With the addition of Aba, the thermodynamic stability and mechanical properties of the scaffolds significantly improved, and the maximum compressive strength and modulus reached 1.34 and 1.89 MPa, respectively, because Aba provided nucleation sites for nanohydroxyapatite (nHAP) to promote mineralization. In vitro cell experiments showed that the hybrid scaffolds had good biocompatibility and promote the proliferation of osteoblasts. In vivo results revealed that the hydroxyapatite of organic matter and trace elements in Aba particles induced the migration of stem cells and active factors to the site of a bone defect. The implantation of 3D-printed scaffolds offered a microenvironment for osteoblast attachment and proliferation, which further promotes osteogenesis-related gene expression, such as bone gamma carboxyglutamate protein (BGLAP), type I collagen (COL1A1), and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), and facilitated the repair of a skull defect.

Surprisingly, the molecular mechanisms by which C. nemoralis generates this pigmented shelled diversity, and the degree of evolutionary conservation present between molluscan shell-forming proteomes, remain unknown. Results: Here, using next generation sequencing and high throughput proteomics, we identify and characterize the major proteinaceous components of the C. nemoralis shell, the first shell-proteome for a pulmonate mollusc. The recent availability of several marine molluscan shell-proteomes, and the dataset we report here, allow us to identify 59 evolutionarily conserved and novel shell-forming proteins. While the C. nemoralis dataset is dominated by proteins that share little to no similarity with proteins in public databases, almost half of it shares similarity with proteins present in other molluscan shells. In addition, we could not find any indication that a protein (or class of proteins) is directly associated with shell pigmentation in C. nemoralis. This is in contrast to the only other partially characterized molluscan-shell pigmentation mechanism employed by the tropical abalone Haliotis asinina. Conclusions: The unique pulmonate shell-forming proteome that we report here reveals an abundance of both mollusc-specific and pulmonate-specific proteins, suggesting that novel coding sequences, and/or the extensive divergence of these sequences from ancestral sequences, supported the innovation of new shell types within the Conchifera. In addition, we report here the first evidence that molluscs use independently evolved mechanisms to pigment their shells.

Allergies to fish and crustaceans were dealt with in the NDA opinion 2004. Molluscs are a large and diverse group, which includes some 100,000 species living in salt water, in freshwater and on land. Some molluscs are an important food source. Molluscs are used as an added ingredient in some processed foods like soups and sauces and in products like surimi. Case reports and patient series indicate that several molluscs, e.g. snail, oyster, clams, mussels, squid, abalone and octopus, can cause food allergic reactions, some of them life-threatening. Prevalence of self-reported mollusc allergy ranges from about 0.15% (4/2716) in school children in France to about 0.4% (or 20% of all seafood allergic cases) in a household survey of 14,948 individuals in the US. A major allergen of most molluscs is the abundant muscle protein tropomyosin, which has been well characterised in several mollusc species. Tropomyosin is an allergen also found in crustaceans, dust mites, and cockroach and other insects. Characterised tropomyosins in molluscs and different crustaceans show similarities but also significant differences in allergenic structures. In addition to tropomyosin, there is evidence that molluscs contain a number of other allergens, but these are poorly defined. Serological and clinical cross-reactivity between mollusc species, as well as between molluscs and crustaceans and house dust mite has been reported. Mollusc allergens do not cross-react with fish allergens. However, there is a possibility that patients reacting to fish infested with the parasite Anisakis might also react to molluscs due to cross-reactivity. Mollusc allergenicity is not reliably reduced by food processing. Tropomyosin allergenicity is heat-resistant. Although the allergenicity of some other mollusc allergens appears to be destroyed by heat treatment, there are also reports of increased allergenicity after heating. There is little information on the lowest dose of mollusc allergen that can cause a clinical reaction.

In abalone Haliotis discus hannai, the microstructural changes in the shell under stress are unclear, and the effect of thermal stress on biomineralization is unknown. The lack of gene information has also hampered the study of abalone biomineralization mechanisms. In this study, the microstructure of reconstructed shell in H. discus hannai was observed to determine the effects of thermal and acidification stress on shell growth. Three nacre protein genes, Hdh-AP7, Hdh-AP24, and Hdh-perlustrin, were characterized, and their expression pattern during shell repair was measured under thermal and acidification stress and compared with those of two known biomineralization-related genes, Hdh-AP-1 and Hdh-defensin. The stress resulted in aragonite plates with corroded or irregular microstructures. The gene expression of two nacre proteins (Hdh-AP7 and Hdh-AP24), which directly induce crystal formation, were more sensitive to thermal stress than to acidification, but the expression of the regulatory nacre protein (Hdh-perlustrin) and the two known genes (Hdh-AP-1 and Hdh-defensin), which are also related to immunity, showed an interlinked, complex pattern change.

However, the development of IMTA in open water systems may not go as smoothly as anticipated-at least in Weihai, China, some producers who have adopted it would prefer to return to monoculture. This paper explores the problem from the angle of the economic performance by providing an in-depth analysis of costs and revenues generated by kelp monoculture and kelp-mollusk polyculture (IMTA). We find that the monoculture generates higher profits during the same production cycle. Besides inherent defects in system design, the rapidly growing labor cost and depressing selling price of the mollusk conspire to aggravate the economic failure of IMTA. Due to positive environmental externalities, the social benefits associated with IMTA are higher than the private benefits. This implies that there is a role for the government to generalize IMTA to achieve more total benefits. But single policy such as subsidies may backfire, a combination of policies designed to promote IMTA could be effective. Statement of relevance: To study practical problems in aquaculture.

The early life of limpets, including the settlement process, is poorly known thus far. The current study evaluated different substrates to induce settlement in P. aspera, including microalgae strains (Halamphora coffeaeformis, Navicula incerta and Pavlova sp.) and crustose coralline algae (CCA) obtained from limpet shells. The results showed that gametes obtained by dissection and matured artificially using alkalinized seawater baths can produce viable larvae able to metamorphose to juveniles. Feeding was not required during larval development, suggesting lecithotrophy. Early postlarvae were identified by the shedding of the velum, and juveniles were identified by teleoconch and active grazing behaviour. The presence of CCA shortened the timing for settlement and increased the ratio of juveniles. The type and abundance of CCA can influence settlement success. Moreover, the results suggested that settlement and metamorphosis in true limpets (Patellogastropoda) might be triggered by a two-step mechanism, i.e. a first cue influencing the shift between swimming and crawling activity and a second cue determining settlement and metamorphosis to early postlarvae and juveniles.",10.1017/S0025315421000916,"Castejon Bueno, Diego/0000-0003-1981-0268; Nogueira, Natacha/0000-0002-4557-3908",0025-3154,1469-7769,,NOV,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0025315421000916,

While the impacts to foundation species may be of particular concern, these ecological catastrophes underscore the need to examine how whole systems respond to a suite of stressors. The recent climate-driven collapse of the bull kelp forest and recreational red abalone fishery in northern California provides an example of unanticipated ripple and lagged effects in the system, intensifying vulnerabilities and accelerating population and fishery collapse. For this case study, we examined 15 years (2003-2018) of biological survey data on the bull kelp forest ecosystem-before, during, and after an extreme climate event. We document the interactions and complexity of impacts over time, as well as the resulting increased vulnerability of red abalone to additional anthropogenic, biological, and environmental stressors. We observed progressively stronger population-level responses of the red abalone to the marine heatwave and the regional loss of kelp, driving the movement of adults and juveniles in search of food. As food remained scarce, we documented the loss of productivity with diminished gonad and body condition, the absence of larval or newly-settled abalone, mass mortalities, and shoreward shifts in depth distributions. With 40% of the population dead or dying, juvenile and trophy-sized abalone abandoning cryptic habitats, the shift in the distribution to shallower depths increased the vulnerability of red abalone to the fishery. Other anthropogenic, biological, and climate-related stressors that disproportionately impact shallow habitats are now a growing concern for the survivors. For red abalone, previously unanticipated cascading risks include increased wave energy, warming air temperatures, freshwater flooding, landslides, as well as possible oil spills and harmful algal blooms. Climate-driven changes in vulnerability to fishing and environmental stressors present significant challenges for sustainable natural resource management in dynamic stressed systems, and underscore the need for continued system-focused monitoring.

In this study, the human sensory test, electronic tongue, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS), and multivariate statistical methods were used to investigate differences in flavor between two groups (high and low groups, respectively) of Pacific abalone with different glycogen contents. The results of the two flavor evaluations consistently showed that the scores of umami and sweetness were significantly higher in the high glycogen content group. Pacific abalone with a higher glycogen content has a better flavor. A total of 295 substantially differential metabolites were identified between the two groups.

Mortality curves indicated that when held for 1 day in sea water at 4 degrees C and 15 degrees C the virus remained infectious and highly pathogenic. In addition, the virus retained partial infectivity after 5 days held at 4 degrees C. Histological examination of abalone tissues following viral exposure confirmed the presence of lesions typical of abalone viral ganglioneuritis in animals showing morbidity signs. An additional experiment was performed to determine the virucidal efficacy of three disinfectants (calcium hypochlorite, Buffodine and the non-ionic surfactant Impress). The disinfectants were used at various doses and durations to treat AbHV prior to injection and immersion challenges. Results showed that Buffodine and the non-ionic surfactant Impress were effective at inactivating the virus with no detectable adverse effects on the abalone's health.

However, overexploitation of abalone, conch, topshell, and limpets has resulted in population declines globally, with numerous species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Various efforts to supplement existing populations by either translocating wild or releasing hatchery-produced stock have suffered from low survival. To understand predictors influencing post-release survival, we conducted a systematic review and quantitative synthesis of literature on marine gastropod releases. Our global review identified 88 studies (575 unique release events) across 18 species. A similar number of releases were conducted in tropical (52 %) and temperate (48 %) regions, although most release events involved either Haliotidae (57 %) or Strombidae (26 %). Most releases used hatchery-produced stock (77 %), highlighting the prominent role of aquaculture. For seven species with sufficient data, we tested the effect of time since release, stock origin (hatchery, translocated), size at release, and density on post-release apparent survival (referred to as 'survival' hereafter), where applicable. Survival declined through time regardless of species. Hatchery-produced and translocated Haliotis fulgens had similar survival post-release, but hatchery-produced Aliger gigas had lower survival probability than translocated stock. Size at release increased survival probability for only two (Haliotis discus and A. gigas) of the seven species.

The objectives of our study were to (1) determine the temporal stability of WS-RLO DNA outside of its abalone host in 14 degrees C and 18 degrees C seawater, (2) develop a standardized protocol for exposing abalones to known concentrations of WS-RLO DNA, and (3) calculate the dose of WS-RLO DNA required to generate 50% infection prevalence (ID50) in the highly cultured red abalone Haliotis rufescens. The WS-RLO stability trials were conducted in October 2016, February 2017, and June 2017. A quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was used to quantify bacterial DNA for 7 d in seawater collected at an abalone farm in southern California, where the pathogen is now endemic. For all trials and temperature treatments, WS-RLO DNA was unstable in seawater for longer than 2 d. To determine an ID50, groups of uninfected juvenile red abalone were subjected to 3-h bath exposures with four concentrations of WS-RLO at 0, 10(3), 10(4), and 10(5) DNA copies/mL. Abalone feces were tested biweekly for the presence of WS-RLO DNA, and abalone tissues were sampled 9 weeks postinfection for histological and qPCR analyses. The ID50 results indicated that our protocol was successful in generating WS-RLO infections; a pathogen dose of 2.3 x 10(3) DNA copies/mL was required to generate a 50% infection prevalence in red abalone tissue. These findings are critical components of disease dynamics that will help assess WS transmission risk within and among abalone populations and facilitate appropriate management and restoration strategies for both wild and cultured abalone species in WS-endemic areas.",10.1002/aah.10102,,0899-7659,1548-8667,,JUN,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aah.10102,32339356

We created a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to specifically identify and enumerate bacterial loads of WS-RLO in abalone tissue, fecal, and seawater samples based on 16S rDNA gene copy numbers. The qPCR assay designed to detect DNA of the WS-RLO was validated according to standards set by the World Organisation for Animal Health. Standard curves derived from purified plasmid dilutions were linear across 7 logs of concentration, and efficiencies ranged from 90.2 to 97.4%. The limit of detection was 3 gene copies per reaction. Diagnostic sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 99.8%. The qPCR assay was robust, as evidenced by its high level of repeatability and reproducibility.

Mean densities ranged from 6.5 to 12.7 urchins 0.25 m-2. The population consisted primarily of urchins up to 40 mm in test diameter in a size distribution which changed from unimodal to bimodal and back over the 2 yr study. Mortality was temporally variable and related to test diameter. Growth rates were somewhat lower than most previous reports for the species and suggested that most of the population was made up of 1 and 2 yr-old individuals.

Here, we studied the effects of manipulated seawater carbonate chemistry on the acid-base status of scallop Chlamys farreri and abalone Haliotis discus hannai. The haemolymph pH of the tested individuals showed a fast response to acidified seawater incubation, and the pH level was restored to a normal value within 1 h of recovery in control seawater. However, no significant correlation (P > 0.05) was found between haemolymph pH and seawater pCO(2) or pH, while the squared Pearson correlation coefficient (R2) ranged from close to zero to 0.41. In addition, although the pCO(2) level of total alkalinity (TA)lowered seawater was lower than half of that in the control, molluscs eliminated less CO2 (less than 80%) to TA lowered waters than to the control waters. These findings seem to disagree with the crucial role of seawater pCO(2) in influencing the acid-base balance of molluscs. CO2 elimination occurs in the microenvironment, and CO2 first diffuses to limited amounts of seawater that tightly surround the gills, causing dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) accumulation in the ventilation sites, which leads to a sharp increase in the pCO(2) of the surrounding seawater. Moreover, in this microenvironment, the pCO(2) level increases much faster and more greatly if the environmental seawater is acidified or contains a lower level of TA. Therefore, mollusc acid-base status is influenced by rapidly varying pCO(2) levels at the ventilation site, which is largely independent of that of the rest of the incubating seawater. In summary, CO2 elimination by molluscs relies heavily on the carbonate chemistry of environmental seawater, and seawater buffering capacity should be taken into consideration instead of considering only pCO(2) or pH in studying the acid-base balance of marine molluscs.",10.1016/j.marenvres.2023.106018,,0141-1136,1879-0291,,JUN,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2023.106018,37149967

All VpGSTs showed differential response profiles depending on the concentrations of various toxicants and exposure times. More notably, the expressions of VpGSTS2 and VpGSTS3 transcripts were significantly up-regulated in hepatopancreas from Cu and B[a]P-exposed animals, indicating that these two sigma VpGSTs were highly sensitive to Cu and B[a]P exposure.

However, with extreme climatic events such as marine heatwaves (MHWs) increasing in frequency and duration, it remains unclear whether MPAs enhance resistance to and recovery from these acute perturbations and how resilience varies across species and ecological traits (e.g. sedentary vs. mobile species). We used 15 years (2007-2021) of kelp forest monitoring data in Isla Natividad, Mexico, to assess the impact, resistance and recovery of the 2014-2016 MHWs on the fish and invertebrate communities inside and outside two fully protected marine reserves. The 2014-2016 MHWs, the most intense and persistent observed in Isla Natividad that coincided with the loss of giant kelp forest, impacted invertebrates but not fish biomass. Marine reserves conferred resistance to the MHWs for the invertebrate communities and wavy turban snails (Megastraea spp.) (J. H. McLean, 1970), as the impact was less severe than in the reference sites. In addition, reserves enhanced the recovery of some species after the MHWs. Inside marine reserves, abalone (Haliotis spp.) (Linnaeus, 1758) and wavy turban snail (benthic sedentary invertebrates) recovered to pre-heatwave biomass after 2 years, and spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) (Randall, 1840) (benthic mobile invertebrate) after 4 years. Outside the reserves, abalone recovered after 3 years, while the other two species never recovered. The warty sea cucumber (Apostichopus parvimensis) (H. L. Clark, 1913) population collapsed after the MHWs and never recovered inside or outside the reserve. Remarkably, abalone biomass had an outstanding and sustained recovery inside reserves, with a fourfold increase in biomass after the MHWs, which was nearly three times higher than the recovery reported outside the reserve. No other species had a sustained recovery after the MHWs, neither inside nor outside the reserve. Our analysis of long-term monitoring data shows that marine reserves cannot fully prevent adverse impacts from extreme climatic events but can enhance species resistance to and recovery from these events. However, benefits conferred by small marine reserves are species-specific and may be limited to species with limited dispersal and localized population dynamics.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

This study, based on four seasonal field samplings and a laboratory incubation experiment, examined the source and seasonal dynamics of DOM and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in the seawater of fish ( Larimichthys crocea , LC), seaweed ( Gracilaria lemaneiformis , GL) and abalone ( Haliotis sp., HA) culturing zones in Sansha Bay, China. Using three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis (EEMs-PARAFAC), three fluorescent components were identified, i. e. protein -like C1, protein -like C2, and humic-like C3. Our results showed that mariculture activities dominated the DOM pool by seasonal generating abundant DOM with lower aromaticity and humification degrees. Accounting for 40 -95 % of total fluorescent components, C1 (Ex/Em = 300/340 nm) was regarded the same as D1 (Ex/Em = 300/335 nm) identified in a 180 -day degradation experiments of G. lemaneiformis detritus, indicating that the cultured seaweed modulated DOM through the seasonal production of C1. In addition, the incubation experiment revealed that 0.7 % of the total carbon content of seaweed detritus could be preserved as recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon (RDOC). However, fish culture appeared to contribute to liable DOC and protein -like C2, exerting a substantial impact on DOM during winter but making a negligible contribution to carbon sequestration, while abalone culture might promote the potential export and sequestration of seaweed -derived carbon to the ocean.

In this study, we aim to investigate the impact of cell culture conditions and nature of hemocyanin biosynthesis of rhogocyte cells dissociated from Haliotis laevigata mantle tissue. Population of cells with different hemocyanin expression levels was profiled using flow cytometry, while hemocyanin concentrations in the media were elucidated by ELISA assay.

Over 7 days of culture, the population of cells tagged with hemocyanin antibody increased steadily while hemocyanin release in the media decreased significantly. Variation of culture medium, temperature, growth supplement type and concentration also impacted the cell growth and hemocyanin biosynthesis.

In protocerebrum, aELH-l-ir was detected in the small-and medium-sized neurons of cluster 6, anterior/posterior medial protocerebral neuropils, protocerebral bridge and central body. In deutocerebrum, the aELH-l-ir was observed in small-sized neurons of cluster 9, fibers between small-sized neurons of cluster 10, medium-sized neurons of cluster 11, olfactory neuropil and medial/lateral antenna I neuropils. In tritocerebrum, the medium-sized neurons of cluster 16, the tritocerebral commissure, and tegumental neuropil showed strong aELH-l-ir. In the ventral nerve cord, the aELH-l-ir was detected in the small-and medium-sized neurons of dorsolateral clusters of subesophageal ganglion. There was no aELH-lir in neurons of thoracic ganglion, but aELH-l-ir exhibited a dot-like structure in the subcapsular space around the thoracic neuropils. In abdominal ganglion, the aELH-l-ir was detected in some medium-sized neurons and abdominal neuropils.

Nacre is intensely studied because its biologically controlled microarchitecture gives rise to remarkable strength and toughness, but the mechanisms leading to its formation are not well understood. Here we present synchrotron spectromicroscopy experiments revealing that stacks of aragonite tablet crystals in nacre are misoriented with respect to each other. Quantitative measurements of crystal orientation, tablet size, and tablet stacking direction show that orientational ordering occurs not abruptly but gradually over a distance of 50 mu m. Several lines of evidence indicate that different crystal orientations imply different tablet growth rates during nacre formation. A theoretical model based on kinetic and gradual selection of the fastest growth rates produces results in qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental data and therefore demonstrates that ordering in nacre is a result of crystal growth kinetics and competition either in addition or to the exclusion of templation by acidic proteins as previously assumed. As in other natural evolving kinetic systems, selection of the fastest-growing stacks of tablets occurs gradually in space and time.

All species were within the size range ingested by juvenile sea urchins, i.e. 6.74-35.89 mu m. Cellular growth rates ranged from 0.44 divisions day(-1) (Rhaphoneis surirella) to 0.73 divisions day(-1) (Navicula seminulum). Eight monocultures of benthic diatoms, mixed diatoms (an equal mixture of the eight species), natural occurring diatoms, and a control (no diatoms) were used as substrata and food to evaluate larval settlement and juvenile growth of S. intermedius. Larval settlement rates differed significantly between experimental substrata after 24 h (p < 0.05) and 48 h (p < 0.01). A significantly higher number of larvae settled on R. surirella (53.34% 2.22 SE) and Nitzschia sp.

Juveniles could detach benthic diatoms with both weak and strong adhesion on the sixth day after settlement when the mouth opened and the teeth could be seen. Greatest growth (test diameter) occurred on N. corymbosa (631.64 pm 1.14 SE). Survival of juvenile was also greatest on N. corymbosa (95.83%+/- 1.05 SE). These results indicate the effectiveness of Nitzschia sp., R. surirella, A. proteus var. oculata and N. corymbosa as single species over mixed diatoms and natural diatoms in larval settlement and juvenile growth of S. intermedius. Thus, Nitzschia sp. has the best potential diet for larval settlement and juvenile growth of S. intermedius. R. surirella can be used as cue to induce larvae settlement, and A. proteus var. oculata and N. corymbosa can be used as food for growing juveniles. Nitzchia sp., R. surirella, A. proteus var. oculata and N. corymbosa can be used as good food by sea urchin hatcheries or nurseries, which have traditionally operated with natural diatom films in China, to improve growth and survival of post-larvae, and increase the consistency of production.

One of these proteins, AP7, has been identified as a participant in nacre (aragonite) fort-nation in the mollusk Haliotis rufescens. However, the role(s) of this protein in aragonite formation is (are) poorly understood, due to the fact that low quantities of this protein are recoverable from the nacre matrix. To overcome this problem, we employed stepwise solid-phase tBOC synthesis to recreate the 66-AA single-chain protein AP7 and utilized this synthetic form for in vitro mineralization studies. We find that the AP7 protein promotes incomplete or interrupted crystal growth and step edge roundening in a concentration-dependent fashion. Using synthetic peptides which represent the 30-AA N-terminal (AP7N) and 36-AA C-terminal (AP7C) subdomains of AP7. we have identified that the mineral modification activity of AP7 is localized to the unstructured. conformationally labile N-terminal subdomain. Interestingly, the 36-AA C-terminal subdomain has no observable direct effect on in vitro calcium carbonate crystal growth; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that AP7C plays an indirect role in AP7 mineralization activity. Qualitative structural studies reveal that AP7, although possessing Zn(II) fingerlike -His-(X)(6)-His,-Cys-(X)(2)-Cys-, and -Cys-(X)(4)-Cys- motifs within its C-terminal region, does not possess the structural characteristics of known Zn(II) finger polypeptides, as evidenced by the presence of an ordered, (x-helical conformation within the C-terminal subdomain of apo-AP7.

This noninvasive technique is ideal for examination of cellular respiratory toxicity since inorganic phosphate, phosphoarginine, and adenosine 5' -triphosphate levels, and the arginine kinase rate constant, can be measured. These parameters were characterized in both red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and owl limpets (Lottia gigantea) during 5-h exposures, to 3 mg L-1 (14.5 muM) 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol, followed by 5-h recovery periods. In exposed abalone, phosphoarginine decreased by 50%, inorganic phosphate increased by 900%, and the arginine kinase rate constant quadrupled-all compared to controls and consistent with an uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Limpets were less severely impacted, showing no change in phosphoarginine, an increase of only 200% in inorganic phosphate, and an approximate doubling of the arginine kinase rate constant. Adenosine 5' -triphosphate level's remained constant in all control and exposed molluscs. In addition, at the cessation of dosing, all biochemical parameters in abalone returned to preexposure levels within 3-4 h, consistent with rapid depuration, whereas the limpet recovery data were inconclusive. We suggest that the owl limpet's greater tolerance toward the pesticide could result from an increased capability for anaerobic glycolysis, which is required to survive the periodic anoxia associated with residing higher in the intertidal zone. Thus, the natural histories of nontarget organisms should be considered when the effects of pesticide exposure are determined.

Larger lobsters ate urchins of all sizes, although small urchins were preferred. The consumption rate was easily sufficient for the lobsters to have caused the documented disappearance of urchins ( and juvenile abalone) in the main abalone fishing area.

We demonstrated first that after 40-hr labeling, the de novo synthesis of collagen in the cell layer of cultured hemocytes represents 9.48 +/- 1.25% with respect to the total [H-3]proline-labeled protein synthesis. In addition, IGF-I elicited a significant stimulation of collagen synthesis in cultured hemocytes in a dose-dependent manner from 10(-10) to 10(-8) M. The maximal stimulation (10(-9) M) induced an increase of 286 +/- 56% with respect to 100% control.

Our model may appear as an excellent system to study the role of growth factors on the regulation of collagen synthesis by molluscan hemocytes.

Examples span polar (Antarctic krill fishery), temperate (west coast pelagic fishery, abalone and rock lobster), and tropical (Torres Strait rock lobster) commercially important fisheries. Responses of these fisheries to either past observed environmental changes or projected future changes are used to deduce some anticipated implications of climate change for fisheries management, including economic impacts and governance considerations.

The aim of this study has been to assess the effect of two different immersion times 24 h and 18 h on growth, mortality, biochemical and elemental composition of two species of oyster, reared in brackish basin of Valli di Comacchio (Ferrara, Emilia-Romagna, Italy). Juveniles of Ostrea edulis and Magallana (Crassostrea) gigas, were cultivated with off-bottom methods from January to July 2023. At the end of the trial, the mean individual mass presented the same data in M. gigas for both immersion time, unlike O. edulis. In the same period both oyster species, reared for 24 h in immersion exhibited higher shell length compared to those immersed for 18 h; while the mortality rate was greater for the 18 h immersion only for O. edulis. The daily growth rate of oysters immersed for 24 h showed a value three times higher in May, which can be attributed to an increase of temperature and consequently to food uptake. In summary, the biochemical analyses of the edible part showed significant differences for O. edulis and M. gigas. O. edulis reared for 18 h of immersion, had a higher percentage of saturated fatty acids than oysters reared for 24 h of immersion; probably due to an increase in palmitic one. The elemental composition of the shell showed no significant differences for calcium and manganese, while the other elements analyzed showed important differences between 24 h and 18 h for both species. In conclusion, immersion time O. edulis and M. gigas, had a limited impact on edible part of oysters, while the elemental composition of the shell presented some significantly (p < 0.05) differences. The data obtained suggest that of the use of the two immersion times, based on the growth phase of oyster, could be optimal for feed availability and maximal clearance rate.

While the supply of Atlantic cod to European markets is relatively stable, this species continues to represent an interesting, and potentially lucrative, opportunity for commercial-scale aquaculture. Due to fishing restrictions and quota decreases over the last decade, the supply of Spanish-caught cod in European markets has declined, while the local demand for this species has increased. As wild-capture will not grow to meet this increased demand, land-based aquaculture of cod could represent a viable production model to satisfy demand. However, both capital investments and operation costs for a Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS) farm are expected to be high, and therefore, all economic aspects must be taken into account before embarking on design or planning considerations. The influence of thermal control on growth, mortality and product quality also represent an important landmark when considering land-based aquaculture operations. The following represents a feasibility study to analyze the different economic scenarios and biological factors that can influence the business potential of growing this species in RAS. 2500 cod individuals were reared at two different thermal regimes (i.e., controlled and natural range, respectively) through 2 pilot RAS set up in the Basque region (Northern Spain). The experiment lasted 430 days. Statistical differences were found in survival between different thermal regimes but no significant differences were detected within the fall or winter seasons. Daily specific growth rates were significantly different during the summer season with some compensatory growth patterns being observed in the natural thermal regime set up. Likewise, statistical significances were found between the fat contents from both temperatures after the summer period. Conversely, no significant differences were observed at sensorial level between the samples obtained within our pilot experiment and commercial samples from wild origin. Electricity use was found to be one of the most significant economic costs to be considered. The present study represents the first technical feasibility attempt on cod in land-based aquaculture from the north of Spain and demonstrates the technical feasibility to produce on-land based cod in the region, the equivalence of growth patterns with previous studies, the usefulness of the proposed thermal regime management as a tool for this species production, and the key economic parameters and thresholds for a potential feasible commercial activity in the region.

These strains were characterized by an advanced polyphasic taxonomy including genome based taxonomy using multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) and in silico DNA-DNA similarity (in silico DDH). Phylogenetic analyses on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the isolates could be assigned to the genus Vibrio, however they were not allocated into any distinct cluster with known Vibrionaceae species. MLSA based on eight protein-coding genes (gapA, gyrB, ftsZ, mreB, pyrH, recA, rpoA, and topA) showed the vibrios formed an outskirt branch of Halioticoli Glade. The experimental DNA-DNA hybridization data revealed that the five strains were in the range of being defined as conspecific but separate from nine Halioticoli Glade species. The G + C contents of the Vibrio ishigakensis strains were 47.3-49.1 mol%. Both Amino Acid Identity and Average Nucleotide Identity of the strain C1(T) against Vibrio ezurae HDS1-1(T), Vibrio gallicus HT2-1(T), Vibrio halioticoli IAM 14596(T), Vibrio neonatus HDD3-1(T) and Vibrio superstes G3-29(T) showed less than 95% similarity. The genome-based taxonomic approach by means of in silico DDH values also supports the V. ishigakensis strains being distinct from the other known Halioticoli Glade species. Sixteen traits (growth temperature range, DNase and lipase production, indole production, and assimilation of 10 carbon compounds) distinguished these strains from Halioticoli Glade species.

Culture of the cells in 50-mu-M ZnSO4 induced an increase in ras protein p21 levels which were maximal within 1 day. Natural-antibody (NAb) binding was significantly increased following 2 days of cell culture in ZnSO4 and continued to increase up to 4 days. The increased NAb binding returned to uninduced levels within 2 days following the removal of added zinc ions from the culture medium. The cells also exhibited a significant increase in natural killer (NK) cell sensitivity following 2 days in ZnSO4. This was maintained as long as the zinc was in the medium, but returned to uninduced levels within 1 day following its removal. The results show that NAb binding and susceptibility to NK cells increased following ras oncogene expression in 10T1/2 cells and that both parameters were regulated by p21 expression. Repeated i.v. administration of whole-serum NAb prior to tumor inoculation reduced the number of early tumors following s.c. injection of Zn++-induced 2H1 cells into Zn++-treated C3H/HeN mice, consistent with an in vivo role for NAb in the defense against ras-transformed cells. In contrast, small but statistically significant reductions in NAb binding were observed following v-H-ras transformation of NIH 3T3 cells or v-src transformation of 10T1/2. The data argue for an NAb- and NK-cell-susceptible phase of ras-induced tumor development which is a prerequisite for these mediators to contribute to a first line of defense against incipient neoplasia, and suggest that characteristics of the recipient cell and the transforming oncogene are important in determining the natural resistance phenotype.",10.1002/ijc.2910500317,,0020-7136,,,Feb-01,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ijc.2910500317,1735612

They increase the fracture resistance of the shell by several orders of magnitude, determine the polymorph of CaCO3 deposited, and regulate crystal nucleation, growth initiation and termination. In addition, they are thought to control the shell microstructures. Understanding how these proteins have evolved is also likely to provide deep insight into events that supported the diversification and expansion of metazoan life during the Cambrian radiation 543 million years ago. Here, we present an analysis of SMPs isolated form the CaCO3 shell of the limpet Lottia gigantea, a gastropod that constructs an aragonitic cross-lamellar shell. We identified 39 SMPs by combining proteomic analysis with genomic and transcriptomic database interrogations. Among these proteins are various low-complexity domain-containing proteins, enzymes such as peroxidases, carbonic anhydrases and chitinases, acidic calcium-binding proteins and protease inhibitors. This list is likely to contain the most abundant SMPs of the shell matrix. It reveals the presence of both highly conserved and lineage-specific biomineralizing proteins. This mosaic evolutionary pattern suggests that there may be an ancestral molluscan SMP set upon which different conchiferan lineages have elaborated to produce the diversity of shell microstructures we observe nowadays.

We predicted that fish reared in colder water would exhibit more pronounced trade-offs among growth, development, and immune parameters than fish in warmer water, and that females would have more pronounced trade-offs than males due to increased energy requirements for ovary development. We found immune function and liver investment were positively related in cold-water fish, but unrelated in warmer water fish. Immune function positively covaried with gonadal investment, but was not associated with somatic investment. Gonadal investment was negatively related to somatic investment, but this was driven by females, as there was no relationship between gonad development and somatic growth in males. We also found that the sexes differed in the relationship between gonadal and liver investments, in which females again exhibited a negative association but males exhibited a positive association.

The abalone fishery of Anda is artisanal or small-scale, typified by fishers gleaning or free-diving on shallow rocky areas which are the typical habitat of abalone. Low densities of 1.67 to 8 individuals per 250 m(2) were observed. Local fishers have knowledge of productive fishing areas. Hence, cage culture of abalone in these areas could be a viable resource conservation strategy as they serve as reproductive reserves to supply larvae for continued productivity of the fishing grounds. Abalone mariculture following the Farmer Field School (FFS) concept was explored to address both resource management and economic needs. As a resource enhancement activity, mariculture guarantees that cultured abalone are allowed to grow to maturity before harvested, while some are retained to restock a marine sanctuary. Since mariculture makes possible the aggregation of individuals, the probability that fertilization would take place is increased. As supplemental source of livelihood, abalone is a high-value commodity and its culture can help augment the income of fishers. Small abalone (3-4 cm) can be cultured further for 3-4 months to increase their size and weight. Mariculture should be done from November to May to avoid the rainy season and improve survivorship. The experiential activity was successful because it became a means for the fishers to experience resource management. Under the FFS, the researcher became a facilitator and mentored the cooperators in learning from their experience. The lessons sharpened the fishers' skills in observation, problem-solving, decision-making, and critical thinking.

Looking for genes under positive selection in pathogens has been a priority in efforts to investigate coevolution dynamics and to develop vaccines or drugs. To elucidate the functions involved in host specialization, here we aimed at identifying candidate sequences that could have evolved under positive selection among closely related pathogens specialized on different hosts. For this goal, we sequenced c. 17 000-32 000 ESTs from each of four Microbotryum species, which are fungal pathogens responsible for anther smut disease on host plants in the Caryophyllaceae. Forty-two of the 372 predicted orthologous genes showed significant signal of positive selection, which represents a good number of candidate genes for further investigation. Sequencing 16 of these genes in 9 additional Microbotryum species confirmed that they have indeed been rapidly evolving in the pathogen species specialized on different hosts. The genes showing significant signals of positive selection were putatively involved in nutrient uptake from the host, secondary metabolite synthesis and secretion, respiration under stressful conditions and stress response, hyphal growth and differentiation, and regulation of expression by other genes. Many of these genes had transmembrane domains and may therefore also be involved in pathogen recognition by the host.

Aerobic and anaerobic batch reactors, operated at 35 degrees C and pH 7, were fed milled A. nodosum, nutrients and inocula adapted to seaweed degradation. The dominant factor for conversion of organic matter during anaerobic digestion was the inhibitory effect of the polyphenols on alginate lyases and methane production. Probably, the relative large fraction of high molecular weight polyphenols (>10 kDa) in this alga gave efficient binding of proteins during digestion. The anaerobic degradation was greatly stimulated when the polyphenols were fixed with low amounts of formaldehyde. An accumulated content of guluronate in the remaining alginate indicated that Ca-crosslinking also limited the guluronate lyase access to the polymer.

We propagated gametophytes by periodic fragmentation and then mixed aseptically an equal number of male and female gametophytes to induce fertilization. Approximately 60days after fertilization, numerous embryonic sporophytes emerged on the seed fibre. By using chlorophyll fluorescence technology, we investigated variation in the photosystem II (PSII) characteristics of M. pyrifera during development from the gametophyte to juvenile sporophyte stage. During this growth period, both the optimal (F-v/F-m) and effective (YII) PSII quantum yields increased significantly from the haploid gametophyte to diploid sporophyte stages.

Larval experience prior to and during metamorphosis can significantly affect adult fitness, but it is presently unknown whether the exact nature of the inductive cue is an experience that matters, or by what mechanism such carry-over effects are mediated. Here we test for carry-over effects of the specific nature of inductive cues on gene expression in metamorphosing postlarvae of the tropical abalone, Haliotis asinina. Postlarvae induced by three different species of coralline algae all successfully undergo metamorphosis, yet the expression profiles of 11 of 17 metamorphosis-related genes differ according to which species of algae the larvae settled upon. Significantly, several genes continue to be differentially expressed for at least 40 h after removal of the algae from the postlarvae, clearly demonstrating a carry-over effect of inductive cue on gene expression. We observe a carryover effect in several genes with varying functions and spatial expression patterns, indicating that each algal species impacts global gene expression in a unique manner. These data unexpectedly reveal that transcriptional modulation of metamorphosis-related genes is contingent upon the precise composition of the benthic microenvironment experienced directly at induction of settlement, and highlight transcription as a mechanism that can mediate between larval and postlarval experiences.

In this study, to determine the factors causing the change in the distribution of E. bicyclis beds as well as the extent of the change, an ecological survey of E. bicyclis and grazing animals was conducted. A 150 m-long fixed line was set up in the rocky coastal area on the Oshika Peninsula in Miyagi Prefecture, and the number of E. bicyclis individuals inhabiting a 1-m width was then measured. In addition, the numbers of individuals of sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus nudus) and abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) were measured. Although the E. bicyclis bed extended to the 64-m point on the fixed line at the time of the survey in August 1999, by July 2001, its lower limit was at the 53-m point; thus, a retreat of the outer edge of the bed of 11 m was observed in 2 years. The density of adult E. bicyclis sporophytes in the bed was reduced from 1.08 to 1.80 individuals (ind.) m(-2), respectively. Juvenile sporophytes were also observed, but most of those that had settled near the lower limit of the bed failed to survive to become adult sporophytes. There were few sea urchins, the main grazing animal on the site, inside the E. bicyclis bed (3.5 ind. m(-2) in October 2001) while there were many near the bed lower limit and on the deep-site side (12.9 ind. m(-2) in October 2001). These results indicate that the high grazing pressure of sea urchins reduced the survival of juvenile sporophytes near the bed lower limit, thus impeding the recruitment of juvenile sporophytes to replace adult sporophytes that died due to senescence, storm action and/or grazing.",10.1007/s10811-008-9337-1,,0921-8971,,,OCT,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-008-9337-1,

X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analyses of the growth of these flat pearl composites reveal that biomineralization is initiated by the deposition of an organic sheet on the implanted substrate, followed by the growth of a calcite layer with preferred {10.4} orientation and, finally, by the growth of nacreous aragonite. The calcite layer is structurally similar to the green organic/calcite heterolayer of native shell nacre. It comprises 0.2-2.0-mu m-diameter elongated crystallites of typical geological habits in various aggregate arrangements. The shell also contains an external layer of (00.1)-oriented prismatic calcite, which is deposited on one edge of a flat pearl and has a morphology similar to that of the {10.4}-oriented calcite layer. The transition from {10.4}-oriented calcite to aragonite in both the shell and the flat pearl is abrupt. In vitro calcium carbonate growth experiments reveal that a similar calcite-to-aragonite transition is induced by the addition of soluble proteins isolated from the aragonitic nacre. The growth of flat pearls is highly sensitive to physical and chemical properties of the abiotic substrate. Either roughened or hydrophobic substrates result in abnormal arrangements of the basal calcite layer, which are corrected for by a reinitiation of the biomineralization process, beginning with the deposition of an organic sheet. Insertion of flat pearls as substrates, however, results in continued nacre growth without the deposition of an organic sheet and a calcite layer.",10.1021/cm9503285,"Mann, Stephen/0000-0003-3012-8964; Speck, James/0000-0002-8045-4090",0897-4756,,,MAR,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/cm9503285,

In addition, characterization of the immune-related functions of hemocyte subpopulations within the hemolymph were assessed. The two antiaggregant solutions tested (Modified Alserver's, MAS, A and B) maintained similar numbers of hemocytes in circulation over a 60 min period but, reduced the viability (MAS A) and increased the ROS production (MAS B) of the hemocytes compared to hemocytes diluted in cold filtered seawater (FSW). Hemocytes diluted in FSW and kept on ice showed significant aggregation after 2 h and a reduction in viability from 4 h.

Despite the long-standing importance of its various members as model species for neurobiology, research on the development of the molluscan nervous system has lagged behind that on several other phyla. Recent studies, however, have begun to sketch an overview of neural development during the complex life cycles of these animals, involving multiple larval and postlarval stages and often including processes of torsion and occasionally detorsion affecting the entire body plan. The first neurons appear early in life and innervate a variety of larval organs. The central and peripheral neurons that comprise the adult nervous system generally appear later in larval life. Metamorphosis involves the loss of many neurons and the gain of others, and yet more neurons change to accommodate transitions in modes of locomotion, feeding and habitat. But such largescale transitions do not stop at metamorphosis as massive changes in body size and behavior occur during juvenile and adult stages, and the nervous system must change accordingly to meet the demands of expanding target tissues and the need to generate new behaviors. Work over the years has gradually revealed some of the genes important in molluscan neural development, but recent whole-genome, EST and microarray projects are now allowing much more rapid progress and providing a valuable molluscan perspective for understanding broader issues concerning the evolution of the nervous system across the animal kingdom.

"Coates, CJ; Söderhall, K",The stress-immunity axis in shellfish,2021,JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY,186,,,,107492,"It is a difficult task to describe what constitutes a 'healthy' shellfish (e.g., crustacean, bivalve). Visible defects such as discolouration, missing limbs or spines, fouling, lesions, and exoskeletal fractures can be indicative of underlying issues, senescence, or a 'stressed' animal. The absence of such symptoms is not evidence of a diseasefree or a stress-free state. Now, more than ever, aquatic invertebrates must cope with acute and chronic environmental perturbations, such as, heatwaves and cold shocks, xenobiotic contaminants, intoxication events, and promiscuous pathogens expanding their host and geographic ranges. With that in mind, how does one determine the extent to which shellfish become stressed in situ (natural) or in cultured (artificial) settings to enhance disease susceptibility? Many biomarkers - predominantly biochemical and cellular measures of shellfish blood (haemolymph) - are considered to gauge immunosuppression and immunocompetence. Such measures range from immune cell (haemocyte) counts to enzymic activities and metabolite quantitation. Stressed invertebrates often reflect degraded conditions of their ecosystems, referred to as environmental indicators. We audit briefly the broad immune functions of shellfish, how they are modulated by known and emerging stressors, and discuss these concepts with respect to neuroendocrinology and immunotoxicology. We assert that chronic stress, alone or in combination with microbial, chemical and abiotic factors, increases the risk of infectious disease in shellfish, exacerbates idiopathic morbidity, and reduces the likelihood of recovery. Acute stress events can lead to immunomodulation, but these effects are largely transient. Enhancing our understanding of shellfish health and immunity is imperative for tackling losses at each stage of the aquatic food cycle and disease outbreaks in the wild.",10.1016/j.jip.2020.107492,"Coates, Christopher/0000-0002-4471-4369",0022-2011,1096-0805,,NOV,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2020.107492,33086084

The aim was to identify the opportunistic species, seasonal variation, relationships with DO, and temperature of epiphytic foraminiferal assemblages under environmental conditions affected by the biodeposits discharged from abalone farming. The results showed that the highest relative abundance of epiphytic foraminifera occurred in September (22.96 degrees C), although the temperature was highest in August (24.37 degrees C); this may be related to the consistently stable high temperatures during this time (22-23 degrees C). There was no direct relationship between DO and epiphytic foraminiferal assemblages. Rosalina bradyi (frequency: 78.6%; species diversity: 0.96; distributed across three areas in July) was found to be an opportunistic species for nutrient enrichment discharged from abalone farming. Epiphytic foraminiferal assemblages of the three areas were varied, from the R. bradyi assemblage in July, to the R. bradyi-Cornuspira involvens or R. bradyi-Murrayinella minuta assemblages in August and September, and to the Glabratella sp.-R. bradyi or Epistominella naraensis-R. bradyi assemblages of January.

This study developed a simple method of liquid nitrogen vapor freezing to improve post-thaw sperm survival in the spermcasting oyster Ostrea angasi. The results indicate that the permeable cryoprotectants, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethylene glycol (EG) and propylene glycol (PG) were non-toxic to sperm up to 20% concentration and 90 min exposure whereas methanol at 10% or higher was toxic to sperm for any exposure over 30 min. Among the treatments with permeable cryoprotectants, 15% EG produced the highest post-thaw sperm motility. Sperm motility was further improved by the addition of non-permeable cryoprotectants (trehalose and glucose), with 15% EG + 0.2 M trehalose resulting in the highest post-thaw sperm motility among all the combinations evaluated. The durations of 20, 30 and 60 min equilibrations produced a higher post-thaw sperm motility and plasma membrane integrity (PMI) than 10 min. Higher post-thaw motility and PMI were achieved by freezing sperm at the 8 cm height from the liquid nitrogen surface than at the 2, 4, 6, 10 or 12 cm height. Holding sperm for 10 min in liquid nitrogen vapor produced higher post-thaw motility and PMI than for 2, 5 or 20 min. The cryopreservation protocol developed in this study improved both post-thaw motility and PMI of O. angasi sperm at least 15% higher than those cryopreserved using programmable freezing method. Liquid nitrogen vapor freezing might have greater applicability in improving post-thaw sperm quality of spermcasting oyster species. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The cDNAs are 1,019 and 827 bp in length and encode proteins of 171 and 173 amino acids, respectively. The 5' UTR of each contains a conserved iron response element (IRE) motif. Sequence analyses reveal that both proteins belong to the H-ferritin family with seven conserved amino acids in the ferroxidase center. Highest expression of Aifer1 is found in the mantle and adductor muscle, while that of Aifer2 is only in the latter tissue. These Aifer genes are differentially expressed following bacterial challenge of the scallop. The expression level of Aifer1 was acutely up-regulated (over 10 fold) at 6 h post-bacteria injection, whereas Aifer2 expression was not significantly changed by bacterial challenge. Both genes were effectively expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), producing proteins of similar molecular weight, approximately 23 kDa. Purified Aifer1 and Aifer2 proteins exhibited iron-chelating activity of 33.1% and 30.4%, respectively, at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Cations, Mg2+, Zn2+ and Ca2+, depressed iron-chelating activity of both proteins. Additionally, the E. coli cells expressing recombinant Aifer1 and Aifer2 showed tolerance to H2O2, providing a direct evidence of the antioxidation function of ferritin. The results presented in this study suggest important roles of Aifer1 and Aifer2 in the regulation of iron homeostasis, immune response, and antioxidative stress in A. irradians.",10.1007/s11033-010-0339-0,,0301-4851,1573-4978,,MAR,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-010-0339-0,20878240

The resulting structure yields unique mechanical properties. in this study, we focus on the thin viscoelastic layers between the tiles and on their role on the mechanical properties of the shell. Both SEM and AFM show that the thin (similar to 30 nm) organic layer is porous, containing holes with diameter of approximately 50 nm. These holes enable the formation of mineral bridges between adjacent tile layers. The mineral bridges play a pivotal role in growth and ensure the maintenance of the same crystallographic relationship through tile growth in the 'terraced cone' mode. The existence of mineral bridges is consistent with the difference between tensile and compressive strength of the abalone. Mechanical tests with loading applied perpendicular to the plane of the organic layers reveal a tensile strength lower than 10 MPa, whereas the compressive strength is approximately 300-SOO MPa. These nanoscale bridges have, by virtue of their dimensions (SO nm diameter x 30 nm length), a strength that reaches their theoretical value. The calculated tensile strength based on the theoretical strength predicts a bridge density of approximately 2.25/mu m(2). A major conclusion of this investigation is that the role of the organic layer is primarily to subdivide the CaCO3 matrix into platelets with thickness of 0.5 mu m. Its intrinsic effect in providing a glue between adjacent tiles may not be significant. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Diversity measures based on information theory (H') in the assemblages ranged from 2.83-4.85 in C2 and C6, respectively. However, a relative diversity index (F) showed C3 to be the most homogeneous assemblage (S = 26) with a maximum value of 0.878. This reflected in part the distribution of the important (frequent) species. Phaeophytes had overall higher frequencies, while rhodophytes showed the greatest number of taxa (58). Ten taxa had relative frequencies higher than three percent and were considered the most important taxa in the abalone habitats surveyed, mainly: Eisenia arborea, Cystoseira osmundacea, Corallina officinalis var. chilensis, Gelidium robustum and Plocamium cartilagineum. Classification analysis based on presence-absence of species roughly distinguished two groups; the first represented by cooperatives 1-4 and the second by C5 and C6, although at low similarity (Jaccard) levels. Considering species importance in the analysis (Morisita's index) a different classification resulted. The divergence of the groups may be due to differences in sampling dates, while the correspondence of assemblages from different dates indicates mainly sharing of important (long-lived) species (E. arborea, C. osmundacea, C offlicinalis var. chilensis).

The IPCC predict that sea surface temperature will raise up to 4 degrees C and monthly average sea surface temperature in Indonesia is around 26 - 31 degrees C. That means in the next century average sea surface temperature could be more than the maximum thermal limit of H. squamata.

In addition, the Phe accumulation in the fish muscle was measured during the experiment. Fish were injected with different concentrations (0,2,20 and 40 mg/kg) of Phe and samples were taken from tissue and blood of fish 1, 4, 7 and 14 days after injection. Exposure of fish to Phe caused a significant decrease in white blood cells, 0 and C4 levels, lysosomal membrane stability, lysozyme activity after 4 days and antibacterial activity after 7 days of the experiment. In contrast, cortisol level significantly increased after 4 days. The concentration of Phe in fish muscle increased rapidly after 4 days. The main tissue changes observed in the head kidney including increase in melanomacrophage centers (MMCs), empty spaces between cells and hemorrhage. The degree of tissue changes ranged from normal to moderate in Phe-treated fish. The size and number of MMCs in treated fish were significantly higher than control.

Biomimetic materials are the synthetic materials that possess one or more design and functional aspects of natural materials like abalone nacre, bone, wood. The present research aimed to replicate the inorganic part of nacre, by taking as-synthesized alpha-alumina platelets as primary building blocks. Ice templating was carried out under large vertical temperature gradient in a custom-built setup, that resulted in large-scale ordered lamellar structure; mainly due to the fast and straightforward self-assembly of platelets during directional solidification. The structural wavelength and lamella thickness, the critical parameters to define the ordered lamellar microstructure, were measured to be 16.23 +/- 2.0 mu m and 2.79 +/- 1.0 mu m respectively.

Although the nature of the compression response (before and after intermediate cold compaction step) did not change considerably, but large differences in the strength, work of fracture and modulus were obtained. This is mainly due to the large reduction of porosity as well as large-scale alignment of alumina platelets in bulk, resulted from the additional intermediate cold-compaction step.

The cyanobacteria had the smallest cell sizes, while the diatoms had the largest. Under planktonic culture conditions, the highest algal density was presented by Synechococcus sp. while the highest growth rate occurred in E. alata. Higher protein content and protein/energy ratio were present in diatoms, carbohydrates in Tetraselmis chuii and cyanobacteria, while those of lipids and energy were recorded in the diatoms E. alata and P. lepidoptera.

However, mechanical damage caused by ice crystals would lead to quality deterioration. Abalone viscera glycopeptide (AVGP) complex was prepared by hydrolysis technology, which exhibited ice recrystallization ability and antioxidant activity. Moreover, effects of AVGP on Ca2+-ATPase activity, total sulfhydryl content, secondary structure of myofibrillar protein (MP), rheological properties, and gel properties of surimi frozen were investigated. Results showed that surimi treated with AVGP could improve the gel strength and rheological properties of surimi, reduce the gel ice crystal holes, and improve the degradation of gel matrix caused by freeze-thaw. AVGP can significantly inhibit the decrease of Ca2+-ATPase activity and total sulfhydryl group content. When the addition of AVGP exceeded 4% (w/w), its freezing protection effect on MP was better than that of commercial antifreeze agents. Moreover, the alpha-helix and beta-fold contents in the 4% AVGP group were significantly higher than those in the control group, indicating that the addition of an appropriate amount of AVGP can protect the secondary structure of MP. Therefore, AVGP could serve as a new food ingredient with antifreeze and antioxidant functions for frozen surimi.

Inflammatory conditions, burns and wounds have been an ongoing concern for human health since the early era of civilisation. Many texts from ancient medicine have recorded the symptoms, signs and treatments for these conditions. Natural treatments are well documented in traditional European medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Siddha and ancient Mediterranean and African traditional medicine and include a surprisingly large number of molluscan species. Materials and methods: An extensive review of the Materia Medico and scientific literature was undertaken using key word searches for mollusc and anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory or wound healing. Results: Molluscs have been used in ethnomedicine by many traditional cultures to treat different aspects of inflammatory conditions. We found 104 different anti-inflammatory preparations from a variety of molluscan species, of which 70 were from the well-documented Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). This traditional use of molluscs has driven the testing for inflammatory activity in extracts from some species in the phylum Mollusca, with 20 in vitro studies, 40 in vivo animal studies and 14 human clinical trials performed to substantiate the anti-inflammatory and wound healing activity of molluscs. Some of these studies have led to the approval of mollusc-derived products to be used as over-the-counter (OTC) nutraceuticals, like Lyprinol and Biolane(TM) from the New Zealand green lipped mussel Perna canaliculus. Conclusion: Natural products provide important leads for the development of pharmaceuticals, including antiinflammatory agents. Only a small proportion of the molluscan traditional medicines have been tested to confirm their anti-inflammatory activity and most screening studies have tested crude extracts from molluscs without any chemical characterisation.

In addition, hemocyanin specifically inhibited viral attachment and entry by binding selectively to the viral surface glycoproteins gD, gB, and gC, probably by mimicking their receptors. However, hemocyanin had no effect on postentry events and did not block infection by binding to cellular receptors for HSV. By the use of different mutants of gD and gB and a competitive heparin binding assay, both protein charge and conformation were shown to be the driving forces of the interaction between hemocyanin and viral glycoproteins. These findings also suggested that hemocyanin may have different motifs for binding to each of the viral glycoproteins B and D.

In this work, the effect of interstitial green sheet polypeptide, GP, extracted from the green layer of the mollusc red abalone shell, on the process of spontaneous precipitation of calcium carbonate polymorphs, was investigated. Three precipitation systems, in which the initial mineralogical composition of the precipitate was different, have been studied. Thus, in system (1) calcite appeared, in system (2) a mixture of calcite and vaterite was found, while in system (3), ASW, only aragonite precipitated.

In this study, the full-length cDNA encoding Vg in noble scallop Chlamys nobilis was cloned. The complete Vg cDNA consists of 7760 nucleotides with an open reading frame encoding 2289 amino acid residues. Phylogenetic analysis of Vg gene revealed that Ch. nobilis was clustered together firstly with its sister species Chlamys farreri and another scallop Mizuhopecten yessoensis, then with other mollusks such as oyster and abalone, and finally with vertebrates. Tissue-specific checking results indicated that Vg gene was only expressed in the ovary. At different gonadal development stages, both orange and brown shell color scallops show the same trend that the amount of Vg mRNA expression kept at a high level at the growing stage, then dramatically decreased at the mature stage, and finally resumed to higher level at the post-spawning stage. Another very important finding is that significantly positive correlations existed between the Vg gene expression level and total carotenoids content, as well as total antioxidant capacity.

To achieve this, however, fishers must be able to cooperate with each other. This paper examines the relationship between trust, cooperation and stewardship in five abalone (Haliotis) fisheries in southeastern Australia. Industry-led resource management initiatives are used as indicators of stewardship, sometimes including substantial sacrifice of catch quota. Higher levels of trust and cooperative capacity enabled greater levels of industry-based resource management in four of the five fisheries. In one case, however, high levels of trust and cooperative capacity did not translate into associated levels of resource management. It is suggested that additional factors, such as perceptions of resource condition, are key determinants of resource stewardship. Private property rights may, therefore, be less important than previously argued. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The ecological implications for the Point Loma kelp forest community were studied by comparing long term data with conditions during and after the spill. Surface ammonium concentrations within I km of the break were at potentially toxic levels, and light levels were reduced enough to have inhibited kelp germination and growth. However, because of El Nino conditions, it is unlikely that kelp would have germinated in the absence of a spill. Beyond 1 km, high ammonium concentrations benefitted the nutrient-depleted surface canopy of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera). Measured sedimentation rates were significantly higher near the outfall during the spill and were strongly I elated to wave height; water motion, however, prevented sediment accumulation. Bioassays were conducted on a grid of stations surrounding the outfall. There were significant reductions in the density and growth of microscopic sporophytes of Macrocystis outplanted near the outfall during the spill, but this pattern disappeared in samples collected 11 d after the repair was completed and was not observed again. Sediments collected near the outfall during the spill significantly reduced Macrocystis germ tube elongation; a post repair assay showed no differences with respect to the outfall. No significant effects were observed in outplants of juvenile Macrocystis sporophytes, cup corals, and juvenile abalones. Video transects during the spill and subsequent diving observations provided no evidence of sediment accumulation or negative impacts on established animal populations. Kelp population dynamics at the permanent sites were predictable from existing population structure and El Nino conditions. Damage to kelps, apparently resulting from a combination of low light and nutrient conditions with mechanical damage from storms, construction activity, and barge anchor cables, was observed along the outfall immediately adjacent to the break point. Shortly after the outfall was repaired, ztpwelling improved conditions for kelp germination and growth, and the zone of maximum impact developed into a dense kelp forest. Suspension feeders, detritivores and sea urchins, whose natural history indicates they could have been affected by the spill, showed no unusual population changes. In the context of the continuum of disturbances observed in two decades of population studies at Point Loma, the spill was a modest disturbance similar to the natural vagaries of kelp recruitment. We emphasize that this spill was an intense but not chronic impact during an EI Nino event that also stressed control areas. However, it is representative of massive spills in coastal regions, and the fact that a sewage spill of this magnitude had no lasting effects on a kelp forest community is of general interest.",10.1016/0141-1136(94)00008-D,,0141-1136,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0141-1136(94)00008-D,

The tree topology resulting from morphological and combined analyses places Betaeus jucundus as sister to all the remaining species of Betaeus and Betaeopsis, rendering Betaeus paraphyletic. On the other hand, Betaeopsis is recovered as monophyletic. Betaeus australis is positioned as sister to the remaining species of Betaeus s. str. (excluding B. jucundus), which is composed of three well-supported and resolved clades. Mapping of biogeographic traits on the combined tree suggests at least two possible historic scenarios. In the first scenario, the North-East Pacific harboring the highest diversity of hooded shrimps (seven species of Betaeus), acted as the center of origin, where species appeared, matured and eventually migrated toward peripheral regions. In the second scenario, Betaeus + Betaeopsis originated in the southern Indo-West Pacific and subsequently colonized the North-East Pacific, where a major radiation involving dispersal/vicariance events took place. The mapping of life history traits (symbiosis vs. free living and gregariousness vs. single/pair living) in the combined tree suggests (1) that different types of symbioses with dissimilar host organisms (sea urchins, abalones, other decapods, spoon worms) evolved independently more than once in the group (in B. jucundus and in various lineages of Betaeus s. str.), and (2) that gregariousness was ancestral in the Betaeus s. str. - Betaeopsis clade and later shifted toward single/pair living in several lineages.

This study examined how different light qualities (blue, white, green, and red light) and intensities (0 and 2-32 mu molm s(-1)) influence the growth and physiological activity of B. areolate juveniles. Changes in the activity of digestive enzymes, such as pepsin (PPS), lipase (LPS), and amylase (AMS), as well as energy metabolic enzymes, such as hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and succinic dehydrogenase (SDH), were also studied. The result showed that juveniles exhibited substantial variations under different light conditions. Specifically, the maximum bodyweight specific growth rates (SGR) under green, blue, red, and white light conditions were 3.56 +/- 0.45 %d(-1), 3.03 +/- 0.68 %d(-1), 3.01 +/- 0.72 %d(-1) and 2.99 +/- 0.73 %d(-1) at light intensities of 2 mu molm(-2)s(-1), 4 mu molm(-2)s(-1), 8 mu molm(-2)s(-1) and 2 mu molm(-2)s(-1), respectively. The shell length SGR, shell width SGR and body weight SGR in the dark group were not statistically different from those in the red light group at 2 mu molm(-2)s(-1) (p > 0.05), while the body weight SGR of the dark group was significantly lower than that in other groups (p < 0.05). At the light intensity of 2 mu molm(-2)s(-1), the activity of PPS in green and blue light was significantly higher than in red light (p < 0.05). The activity of HK in green light was considerably higher than that in darkness (p < 0.05), and there was no significant difference in the activity of LDH between the dark group and the red light group (p > 0.05), although the results of both groups were significantly higher than those of the blue and white light (p < 0.05). In addition, the activity of PPS, AMS, HK, PK, and LDH was considerably higher in darkness than in other light qualities (p < 0.05). Under different light qualities, the activity of all enzymes at the low light intensity was significantly higher than that at the high light intensity (p < 0.05), which coincided with growth characteristics. Therefore, blue and green light promoted the growth of juveniles at low light intensity (2 mu molm(-2)s(-1)), but darkness inhibited their growth.

Two of these middens, CA-SRI-26 on Santa Rosa Island and CA-SMI-692 on San Miguel Island, are among the older reported red abalone middens, at roughly 8000-7300 cal BP and help fill a significant temporal gap in our understanding of the initial period of intensive red abalone harvest. The third midden, CA-SMI-172, dates to similar to 6300 cal BP and fills a spatial gap on eastern San Miguel Island. When placed in the context of other Channel Island red abalone middens, our analysis demonstrates that people at some of the earliest red abalone middens harvested more red abalone and larger sized individuals than later in time.

Using Hong Kong. the region's largest entrepot. its a focal point, the trade in shark fins, abalone, beche-de-mer and dried fish is characterized in terms of product history, volume, source fisheries and species composition. Trends identified in the Hong Kong market are interpreted in the context of the larger Chinese market. Shark fin imports grew 6% per year between 1991 and 2000, most likely because of market expansion Mainland China, posing increasingly greater pressures on global shark resources. In contrast, the quantities of dried abalone traded through Hong Kong remained steady, but inferences based on this trend are discouraged by suggestions of increasing preferences for fresh product forms and growing domestic production in Mainland China. Hong Kong's imports of dried beche-de-mer (sea cucumber) have decreased. while the percentage of imports re-exported has remained steady, suggesting that Hong Kong continues as an entrepot for Mainland China despite declining domestic consumption. Few conclusions can be drawn regarding dried fish products, including whole fish and fish maws, because of a lack of product differentiation in customs data, but a market survey was conducted to provide information on species composition. Comparison of Hong Kong dried seafood trade statistics to those of other key trading partners indicates that, in general, Hong Kong's duty-free status appears to encourage more accurate reporting of traded quantities. Under-reporting biases ranged from 24 to 49'% for shark fin and beche-de-mer, respectively. Comparison to United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) databases indicates additional under-reporting for shark fin such that an alternative minimum estimate of world trade is at least twice the FAO estimates in 1998-2000. The results of a survey of Hong Kong traders provide insight into their attitudes toward harvest, economic and regulatory factors, and suggest that conservation efforts are unlikely to emerge from, or be actively supported by, dried seafood trade organizations.

New tools are needed, however, to resolve the functional consequences of these dissolved signal molecules. Freshly spawned eggs from red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) naturally release L-tryptophan, which stimulates chemotactic responses by conspecific sperm. Here, microspheres were manufactured to the approximate size and the same shape as female gametes and formulated to emit controlled doses of chemoattractant, imitating natural L-tryptophan release rates: When experimentally tested for effectiveness, male gametes did not distinguish between chemically impregnated mimics and live eggs, demonstrating that L-tryptophan alone is both necessary and sufficient to promote chemotaxis, and confirming the identity of a native sperm attractant.

Results suggest that highest efficiency in sedimentation stage were found when effluent was left standing for 6 hours, with removal of 94.0%, 93.6%, 41.6%, 74.3%, 47.4% and 56.1% of chlorophyll a, BOD5, N-NH3, N-NO2, N-NO3 and P-PO4, respectively. The best result to remove turbidity from raw effluent was found in the 24 hours treatment with 95.5% removal rate, when compared with rates of 93.5% for 12 hours and 78.4% for 6 hours. In the nutrient absorption stage, highest removal rates were found in the 6 hours treatment with 23.7%, 47.1%, 7.1%, 37.0% and 48.4% for BOD5, N-NH3, N-NO2, N-NO3 and P-PO 4, respectively, when compared to the control tank. Finally, integrating sedimentation and absorption, all treatments showed high removal efficiency. Turbidity for the three settling times tested was of 95.8% (6 h), 96.6% (12 h) and 96.8% (24 h). In the final removal of BOD 5 the best result was observed in the 6 hours treatment, with 90.7% removal rate, when compared to the 12 hours (85.6%) and the 24 hours (81.4%) treatments.

Classical assays that traditionally focus on a limited number of selected endpoints have thus far proven to be of limited success in this regard. Here, we apply H-1-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based chemometric analysis to the marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis to investigate changes in the metabolic profile of digestive gland tissue as a response to exposure to nickel and chlorpyrifos, both as single chemicals and as a mixture. The multivariate data was analysed by principal component analysis and partial least-squares discriminant analysis. The major metabolite changes responsible for the spectral differences observed were related to amino acid, nucleotide and methylamine metabolism in all 3 cases. In addition, novel metabolic profiles were associated with exposure to each chemical and the mixture. Nickel produced changes in energy metabolism while chlorpyrifos resulted in an increase in acetylcholine levels. Mussels exposed to a single compound demonstrated a significantly different response to those given the mixture, where a small antagonistic effect was evident.

Both viruses cause diseases associated with high mortality rates, resulting in dramatic economic losses in the aquaculture industry. There are currently no effective treatments for either of these two viral diseases. Thus, early, rapid, and accurate diagnosis plays a fundamental role in disease prevention and control in aquaculture. Traditional methods of diagnosis, such as virus culture, enzyme-linked immunoassay, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are either time consuming or require sophisticated temperature control devices. In this study, one sets of specific primers and probes were designed for the real-time quantitative recombinase polymerase amplification (qRPA) detection of AbHV and RGNNV separately. The sensitivity and specificity of detection were evaluated by comparison with detection by conventional PCR and quantitative PCR. The optimal reaction temperature and time for virus detection is 37 degrees C for 20 min. The detection limit is 100 copies per reaction, making this approach faster and more sensitive than qPCR in this study.

The basic model, model 1, assumes that all tags have the same recovery rate. An alternative, model 0, allows newly tagged animals to have a different tag recovery rate than previously tagged animals. This feature might be necessary because new tags are less fouled and more visible than previously applied tags and thus have a higher reporting rate. Model 0 accommodates the different recovery rates through the use of additional parameters, which leads to larger standard errors than in model 1. Model 0', a new model, also allows newly tagged animals to have a different tag recovery rate than previously tagged ones. It makes use of a known fouling time (the time it takes for tags on newly tagged animals to have the same visibility as tags on previously tagged animals) to divide the year into two parts. During the first part of the year the tags on newly tagged animals are more visible than those on previously tagged ones, while in the second part all tags have the same visibility. Dividing the year into parts and recording the recaptures in each part avoids the failure of the assumption that the reporting rate is constant for all tagged animals, achieves greater precision, and provides estimates of the survival rate at the end of the second year instead of at the end of the third year (as in model 0). The superiority of model 0' over models 0 and 1 is demonstrated for several cases using Monte Carlo simulation. Simulations were based on the queen conch Strombus gigas fishery of the Turks and Caicos Islands, British West Indies. For that fishery, if the tag reporting rate is altered by 25% or more by fouling, it is beneficial to use model 0' instead of model 1.",10.1080/02755947.2012.661383,"Waterhouse, Lynn/0000-0002-7455-7632",0275-5947,1548-8675,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2012.661383,

Here, we define a systematic relationship between the ability of biomolecules in solution to promote the growth of calcite (CaCO3) and their net negative molecular charge and hydrophilicity. The degree of enhancement depends on peptide composition, but not on peptide sequence. Data analysis shows that this rate enhancement arises from an increase in the kinetic coefficient. We interpret the mechanism of growth enhancement to be a catalytic process whereby biomolecules reduce the magnitude of the diffusive barrier, E-k, by perturbations that displace water molecules. The result is a decrease in the energy barrier for attachment of solutes to the solid phase. This previously unrecognized relationship also rationalizes recently reported data showing acceleration of calcite growth rates over rates measured in the pure system by nanomolar levels of abalone nacre proteins. These findings show that the growth-modifying properties of small model peptides may be scaled up to analyze mineralization processes that are mediated by more complex proteins. We suggest that enhancement of calcite growth may now be estimated a priori from the composition of peptide sequences and the calculated values of hydrophilicity and net molecular charge.

The AP8 proteins have compositions dominated by Asx (similar to 35 mol %) and Gly (similar to 40 mol %) residues, suggesting that their structures have high Ca2+-binding capacity and backbone flexibility. The growth of asymmetrically rounded CaCO3 crystals in the presence of AP8 reveals that both proteins preferentially interact with specific locations on the crystal surface. In contrast, CaCO3 crystals grown with nacre proteins depleted of AP8 retain the morphology of unmodified calcite rhombohedra.

The epitope distribution shows that CCH subunits display common epitopes (group I, 5 MAbs, 1H5, 2A8, 3A5, 3B3, and 3E3), as well as specific epitopes for CCH-A subunits (group II, 3 MAbs, 1B8, 4D8, and 8E5) and for CCH-B subunits (group III, 5 MAbs, 1A4, 1E4, 2H10, 3B7, and 7B4). The results can be summarized as follows: (1) six antibodies react with thermal denatured CCH, suggesting that they recognize linear epitopes, whereas seven recognize conformational epitopes; (2) oxidation of carbohydrate moieties does not affect the binding of the MAbs; (3) enzymatic digestion of CCH decreases the reactivity of all antibodies irrespective of the protease used (elastase or trypsin); (4) bringing together the above data, in addition to epitopic complementarity analysis, we identified 12 different epitopes on the CCH molecule recognized by these MAbs. The anti-CCH MAbs presented here can be useful tools to understand the subunit organization of the CCH and its complex structure, which can explain its immunogenic and immunostimulating properties in mammals.",10.1089/153685902761022715,"Faunes, Fernando/0000-0003-2657-2552",1536-8599,,,OCT,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/153685902761022715,12470479

The Capelinhos volcano was formed in 1957/58 during a Surtseyan and partly effusive eruption that added an 2.5 km(2) tephra and lava promontory to the western end of Faial Island (Azores, central North Atlantic). Subsequent coastal and submarine erosion has reduced the subaerial area of the promontory and created a submarine platform. This study uses historical information, photos and marine geophysical data collected around the promontory to characterize how the submarine platform developed following the eruption. Historical coastline positions are supplemented with coastlines interpreted from 2004 and 2014 Google Earth images in order to work out the progression of coastline retreat rate and retreat distance for lava- and tephra-dominated cliffs. Data from swath mapping sonars are used to characterize the submarine geometry of the resulting platform (position of the platform edge, gradient and morphology of the platform surface). Photographs collected during SCUBA and ROV dives on the submarine platform reveal a rugged surface now covered with boulders. The results show that coastal retreat rates decreased rapidly with time after the eruption and approximately follow an inverse power-law relationship with coastal retreat distance. We develop a finite-difference model for wave attenuation over dipping surfaces to predict how increasing wave attenuation contributed to this trend. The model is verified by reproducing the wave height variation over dipping rock platforms in the UK (platform gradient 1.2 degrees to 1.8 degrees) and Ireland (1.8 degrees). Applying the model to the dipping platform around Capelinhos, using a diversity of cliff resistance predicted from known lithologies, we are able to predict erosion rate trends for some sectors of the edifice. We also explore wider implications of these results, such as how erosion creates shallow banks and guyots in reef-less mid-oceanic archipelagos like the Azores.

As in a number of marine invertebrates, inter- and intra-specific interactions are of importance in selecting a habitat, and specific chemical factors are involved. This study focuses on the sediment preferences of larvae and juveniles and includes an assessment of both the positive and negative chemical cues. The data confirm an attraction of juvenile conspecifics to each other during settlement in a gregarious type of positive response, whereas a negative response to sediments that have been populated by adult A. marina exists. Attraction and larval settlement were induced by a number of synthetic chemicals, including fatty acids, amino acids and tripeptides, and by Rhodomonas sp. and Nephtys hombergii populated sand. Aquatic fish food (Tetra-Marine, commercial trout diet) enriched sediment induces settlement at a similar range; this suggests that settlement can be induced non-specifically by water soluble compounds, which may indicate organically enriched and therefore potentially favourable sites for settlement. In A. marina, brominated aromatics (e.g. 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid) inhibit settlement and function as negative cues in a similar way to those described for terebellid polychaetes. Negative cues may be more important than positive cues and their role in substratum choice by invertebrate larvae has been underestimated.",10.3354/meps166187,"Bentley, Matt/0000-0002-6494-2545",0171-8630,1616-1599,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps166187,

Recently, several isolates of F. halioticida were obtained from moribund mussels and categorized into two type strains, FR21 and FR22. Two other strains, AG1 and AG3, determined to belong to the genus Francisella were isolated. To determine the virulence of these isolates, juvenile and adult blue mussels were injected with bacterial solutions at high dose and monitored for 11 days. FR22c and FR22d were found to induce 80% mortality in less than seven days. The isolates AG1 and AG3 led to over 50% mortality in adult mussels but only AG1 led to significant mortality in juveniles (41%). FR22c and FR22d, the most virulent isolates, were selected to determine their respective lethal dose at 50% (LD50) in juveniles and adults. This analysis was performed with bacterial solutions ranging from 102 to 106 CFU/mussel and monitored for 30 days. The isolate FR22c was found to be the most virulent. Observed LD50 for the isolate FR22c was 4.14 x103 CFU/juvenile and 3.45 x103 CFU/adult and for the isolate FR22d, 1.89 x104 CFU/juvenile and 1.52 x104 CFU/adult. To confirm Koch's postulate, a selection of moribund, surviving and control animals were plated on specific media. The isolates were reisolated from moribund animals but not from surviving or controls. To confirm the proliferation, a specific real-time PCR was performed. All moribund individuals were positive by PCR. The main Ct values were lower for moribund compared to surviving animals and a dose effect was observed in DNA bacterial load.

Whilst NTZs may be considered an essential part of optimal management, few studies have specifically compared the effects of NTZs with those of correctly applied gear and effort controls. A yield-per-recruit (YPR) population model, based on the sedentary abalone Haliotis laevigata, was used to compare the effects of management by minimum landing size (MLS), effort limitation and NTZs, either singularly or in combination. Initially, a minimum basic YPR model was used. Three additional assumptions were sequentially added to the model to see if they affected conclusions drawn from the model. The additional assumptions were the inclusion of: (i) a length-fecundity relationship; (ii) an age-dependent natural mortality function; and (iii) mortality of undersized individuals due to fishery operations. In the absence of undersized mortality caused by fishing, under virtually all conditions the population is best managed with a combination of MLS and effort control, without any NTZs. For simulations that included mortality of undersized individuals in the fished area, under nearly all circumstances NTZs were considered an essential part of optimal fishery management, and management incorporating NTZs greatly increased the sustainable yield that could be taken.",10.1111/j.1467-2679.2007.00246.x,"Shepherd, John/0000-0002-5230-4781",1467-2960,1467-2979,,SEP,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2679.2007.00246.x,

Three qualitative conceptual models were developed and compared; the first and second ones assuming homogeneous and heterogeneous environmental conditions, respectively, and the third expanded one considering eco-social components under the assumption of environmental heterogeneity. For all these models, the factors described by Vasquez [Bot. Mar. 38 (1995) 251] were included in the management plan for the harvesting of brown macroalgae. Based on Levins's Loop Analysis, the system will have a just weakly unstable moving equilibrium if the harvesting activities do not negatively affect the macrophyta's reproduction and recruitment processes. Therefore, coincidence of reproduction and/or recruitment with harvesting must be avoided in a putative management plan. Regarding the qualitative predictions of the system's behaviour after negatively affecting reproduction and recruitment, only an ecological model assuming a heterogeneous environment shows realistic responses in comparison to experimental studies on the same species. This contribution is the first approach considering the dynamical behaviour of L. nigrescens and its surroundings. Nevertheless, further models, based on the same modelling theory, may integrate more variables from social and economical fields in order to improve the scope of this complex system. Further comparative studies should focus on the assessment of the significance of the structural functions of L. nigrescens and other macroalgae for the conservation of this benthic system.

Ion substitution and supplementation experiments with artificial sea water (ASW) have, however, shown that metamorphosis can be induced by elevation of the potassium ion concentration alone. Approximately 19 mM K+ ASW (10mM 'excess') was found to elicit maximal metamorphic responses: 29 and 39 mM K+ ASW had no inductive effect. Choline chloride was also found to induce metamorphosis in a dose-dependent manner, with 10-4 M ineffective, 10-3 M approximately threshold, and 5x10-3 M to 10-2 M optimal. Concentrations of choline > 10-2 M were sub-lethally toxic. That the absence of larval metamorphosis on exposure to 29 and 39 mM K+ ASW was due to inhibition is inferred from interaction experiments with choline: at these concentrations of K+, metamorphosis in response to choline could be abolished. Timed-exposure experiments indicated that artificial induction elicited by elevated K+ and choline involve either separate mechanisms, or different parts of the same pathway. Thus, whilst larvae required to be continuously exposed to 19 mM K+ ASW in order to complete metamorphosis, those exposed to 10-2 M choline would subsequently complete development in normal ASW following only 1-2 h exposure to the inducer. Preliminary experiments failed to specify further the nature of the natural inducer, beyond the confirmation that live intact colonies of the bryozoan Electra pilosa will trigger larvae to metamorphose.",10.1017/S0025315400037395,"Bentley, Matt/0000-0002-6494-2545; Havenhand, Jon/0000-0003-0253-3428; Havenhand, Jonathan/0000-0001-6721-7763",0025-3154,1469-7769,,FEB,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0025315400037395,

An outbreak of a herpes-like virus among commercially fished abalone populations in the south-west fishery of Victoria, Australia, during 2006-2007, has been associated with high mortality rates among all cohorts. Long-term records from fishery-independent surveys of blacklip abalone Haliotis rubra (Leach) enabled abundance from pre- and post-viral periods to be analysed to estimate stock density and biomass. The spatial distribution of abundance in relation to physical habitat variables derived from high-resolution bathymetric LiDAR data was investigated. Significant differences were observed in both measures between pre- and post-viral periods. Although there was some limited evidence of gradual stock improvement in recent years, disease-affected reefs have remained below productivity rates prior to the disease outbreak suggesting a reduction in larval availability or settlement success. This was corroborated by trends in sublegal sized blacklip abalone abundance that has yet to show substantial recovery post-disease. Abundance data were modelled as a function of habitat variables using a generalised additive model (GAM) and indicated that high abundance was associated with complex reef structures of coastal waters (<15m). This study highlights the importance of long-term surveys to understand abalone recovery following mass mortality and the links between stock abundance and seafloor variability.",10.1111/fme.12145,"Ierodiaconou, Daniel/0000-0002-7832-4801; Gorfine, Harry/0000-0001-6933-3389; Christiansen, Fredrik/0000-0001-9090-8458",0969-997X,1365-2400,,DEC,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.12145,

The results indicated that U. clathrata not only had strong DIN and DIP removal capacities, but also showed a significant inhibitory effect on V. anguillarum, although not reducing the total heterotrophic bacteria. Vibrio anguillarum 65 dropped from 5 similar to 8 x 10(7) cfu mL(-1) to 10 cfu mL(-1) (clone-forming units per mL) in 10 g L-1 of fresh U. clathrata culture within 2 days; i.e., almost all of the Vibrios were efficiently eradicated from the algal culture system. Our results also showed that the inhibitory effect of U. clathrata on V. anguillarum strain 65 was both DIN- and DIP-dependent. Addition of DIN and DIP could enhance the inhibitory effects of the algae on the Vibrio, but did not reduce the total heterotrophic bacteria. Further studies showed that the culture suspension in which U. clathrata was pre-cultured for 24 h also had an inhibitory effect on V. anguillarum strain 65. Some unknown chemical substances, either released from U. clathrata or produced by the alga associated microorganisms, inhibited the proliferation of V. anguillarum 65.",10.1007/s10811-007-9307-z,,0921-8971,1573-5176,,DEC,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-007-9307-z,

As the rates of climate change and exploitation accelerate, additive. and synergistic interactions between them are becoming increasingly important to the dynamics of marine ecosystems and the sustainability of marine fisheries. We examine the impacts of climate change and fishing pressure on the stocks of three commonly exploited intertidal invertebrates on Northeast Pacific rocky shores. California sea mussels (Mytilus calfiornianus) are not likely to experience dramatic population shifts in the face of climate change, and the current low levels of exploitation appear to be sustainable. Owl limpets (Lottia gigantea), which grow more slowly, exhibit higher temperature sensitivity, and are preferred targets of fishers, will likely experience considerable reductions in distribution and abundance if temperatures rise and exploitation continues. Black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii) have already experienced dramatic declines directly attributable to over-exploitation and indirectly to warming trends that have exacerbated the effects of a devastating disease. Two generalities emerge from these comparisons. First, differences in life history characteristics result in a wide range of climatic and anthropogenic effects among species. Second, the effects of fishing pressure may unexpectedly magnify the effects of climate change, and vice versa. Synergistic interactions between environmental change and exploitation on rocky shores and in other marine ecosystems present considerable challenges for fisheries managers. The key to successful management and restoration in marine systems lies in developing a mechanistic understanding of the interactions between climate change and fishing pressure and how they affect population and ecosystem dynamics.",,"Harley, Christopher/0000-0003-4099-943X",0575-3317,,,DEC,,

We investigated this possibility utilizing as a model system the differentiation of the mesenchymal cell line C3H 10T1/2 (10T1/2) to adipocytes, and a series of transfectants of 10T1/2 cells in which the level of the ras gene product (p21ras; Ras) can be effectively up- or down-modulated. In agreement with previous reports, we found that 10T1/2 cultures, propagated in the resting state for several weeks, spontaneously convert to fat cells at a very low frequency. Downmodulation of endogenous p21ras levels, as a consequence of expression of antisense ras, markedly increased the rapidity and frequency of adipose conversion (6- to 10-fold), which was equivalent in magnitude to that effected by the potent differentiating agent 5-azacytidine. Conversely, overexpression of ras completely inhibited cell differentiation. In addition, adipocytes derived from antisense-ras expressing lines were characterized by a decrease in hormone responsiveness, as well as an apparent deficiency in attaining the terminally differentiated state. These findings suggest that Ras may be a negative regulator of the decision-making step of fibroblast differentiation to adipocytes. In addition, Ras may play an essential positive role in the transduction of hormonal signals necessary for full adipocytic maturation during later progression along the differentiation pathway.",10.1139/o92-171,"Anderson, Stephen/0000-0002-7856-4266",0829-8211,1208-6002,,OCT-NOV,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/o92-171,1297345

Isolated acrosomal rings contain proteins of various sizes: 35-,48-,63-,75- and 88-kDa. These proteins, called bindins, have identical 24-residue signal peptides and conserved 97-residue N-terminal sequences, and they differ in mass because of the presence of between 1 and 5 tandemly repeated 134-residue fucose-binding lectin (F-lectin) domains. Southern blots suggest that oyster bindin is a single copy gene, but F-lectin repeat number and sequence are variable within and between individuals. Eight residues in the F-lectin fucose-binding groove are subject to positive diversifying selection, indicating a history of adaptive evolution at the lectin's active site. There is one intron in the middle of each F-lectin repeat, and recombination in this intron creates many combinations of repeat halves. Alternative splicing creates many additional size and sequence variants of the repeat array. Males contain full-length bindin cDNAs of all 5 possible sizes, but only one or two protein mass forms exist in each individual. Sequence analysis indicates that recombination and alternate splicing create hundreds, possibly thousands, of different bindin sequences in C. gigas. The extreme within-species sequence variation in the F-lectin sequence of oyster bindin is a novel finding; most male gamete-recognition proteins are much less variable. In experimental conditions oyster eggs have poor polyspermy blocks, and bindin diversity could be an evolutionary response by sperm to match egg receptors that have diversified to avoid being fertilized by multiple sperm.",10.1387/ijdb.082581ss,,0214-6282,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1387/ijdb.082581ss,18649288

As a result, the prevalence of F. halioticida in low temperature period increased for all year groups, but any association with scallop mortality was recognized. On the other hand, in the 2017-2019 year groups, increase of the prevalence and rapid declines of scallop survival were recognized in high-temperature periods. Additionally, overall survival in these year groups were apparently lower than the 2020 year group without increase of the prevalence in high-temperature period, suggesting that infection of F. halioticida in high-temperature periods may be associated with mortality of scallops.

We studied the morphology and function of the epithelium in the giant keyhole limpet Megathura crenulata. All exposed surfaces of the limpets were covered by a mucus-secreting, simple columnar epithelium, in which most cells on the sole of the foot bore cilia, while the majority of cells on the side of the foot and three mantle regions bore microvilli. None of the coatings had antibacterial properties. The epithelium of the foot was distinct from that of other regions, in that the mucus secreted was used for locomotion and was left behind as the limpet moved. The glycocalyx bound to the microvilli of the mantle cells appeared to be clean in visual and SEM examinations, and attempts to enhance the binding of inert particles and bacteria were unsuccessful. Because studies have shown that standard tissue processing may cause artifactual shrinkage of mucous layers, cryostat sections and additives to standard fixatives were tested, but we found no change in the thickness of the mucous layers of the limpets compared to routinely processed tissues. Sloughing of the glycocalyx in vertebrate systems removes bound microbes, and alterations of the glycocalyx layers are associated with disease conditions. Sloughing of the glycocalyx on limpets was rarely observed. In one case, the outer mantle of the limpet was covered with silt and the glycocalyx appeared to be detaching. This process could be experimentally induced by dousing the outer mantle with talc particles. The types of secretory cells producing the mucus in each region of the skin were characterized using standard histological stains and lectin staining. Because analysis was hampered by their small size, classification of the types of secretory cells was based on TEM descriptions of granule morphology, which allowed for comparison to the secretory cells described from skin of the abalone.

These proteins have been shown to preferentially interfere with calcium carbonate mineral growth in vitro. It is believed that both proteins play an important role in aragonite polymorph selection in the mollusk shell. Previously, we demonstrated the 1-30 amino acid (AA) N-terminal sequences of AP7 and AP24 represent mineral interaction/modification domains in both proteins, as evidenced by their ability to frustrate calcium carbonate crystal growth at step edge regions. In this present report, using free N-terminal, C-alpha-amide capped synthetic polypeptides representing the 1-30 AA regions of AP7 (AP7-1 polypeptide) and AP24 (AP24-1 polypeptide) and NMR spectroscopy, we confirm that both N-terminal sequences possess putative Ca (II) interaction polyanionic sequence regions (2 X -DD- in AP7-1, -DDDED- in AP24-1) that are random coil-like in structure. However, with regard to the remaining sequences regions, each polypeptide features unique structural differences. AP7-1 possesses an extended beta-strand or polyproline type II-like structure within the A11-M10, S12-V13, and S28-I27 sequence regions, with the remaining sequence regions adopting a random-coil-like structure, a trait common to other polyelectrolyte mineral-associated polypeptide sequences.

I argue that such a staged sequence yields useful information not only for phylogenetic reconstruction and systematics but also for grounding the comparative study of gastropod metamorphosis and life-history evolution. Secretion of juvenile shell follows a retreat of the mantle, so that the first material is deposited beneath the surface of the protoconch rather than at its margin. Growth continues by advance and retreat of the mantle, resulting in progressive imbricate thickening of the shell. The two velar notches fill sequentially. The anterior siphonal canal elongates before accretionary growth begins along the outer lip and before juvenile lip shape and juvenile ornamentation are established. The velum is lost through a combination of gradual disintegration and resorption during the period of secretory reorganization. The larval and early juvenile shells of other gastropods record many kinds of change. Sculptural zonation is common and provides indirect evidence of sequential reprogramming.

The muscle was found to comprise a densely packed three-dimensional array of muscular and connective tissue fibers, supporting the hypotheses of previous authors that it functions as a muscular hydrostat. The fiber arrangement is not uniform throughout the entire muscle; instead it includes three regions that grade into one another. Nearest its origin, the muscle consists primarily of longitudinal muscle fibers with few dorsoventral or transverse fibers, and no oblique fibers. The middle portion of the columellar muscle in the region posterior to the head consists of longitudinal, dorsoventral, and transverse fibers wrapped by two opposed layers of oblique fibers. The third region of the columellar muscle extends through the foot and includes longitudinal, transverse, and dorsoventral fibers with a layer of oblique fibers on the dorsal surface. A narrow band of spherical spaces divides the columellar muscle into dorsal and ventral halves in this region.

Flow cytometry performed on an fine-needle aspiration (FNA) sample [ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirate flow cytometry or flow cytometry performed on an FNA sample (FNAFC)], has been shown to be a valuable adjunct to FNACB in the diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorders of the spleen, kidney, and thyroid. The objective of this study was to appraise FNAFC's utility as an ancillary tool to detect NHL arising in the head and neck region in adult patients.Methods This is a retrospective study involving 52 adult patients with head and neck lymphadenopathies and masses suspicious for lymphoproliferative disorders, who underwent ultrasound-guided FNACB and ultrasound-guided FNAFC between January 2017 and November 2022. Patient demographics, FNACB histopathological and immunophenotypic results, postoperative histopathology results (when available), and follow-up information until May 2023 were reviewed.Results Of the 52 FNACB samples, 23 samples (44.2%) yielded a diagnosis negative for carcinoma, 20 samples (38.5%) were nondiagnostic on account of scant cellularity, 8 samples (15.4%) were suspicious for malignancy, and a single sample (1.9%) was compatible with malignancy. Regarding FNAFC samples, 37 samples (71.2%) were diagnosed as showing no evidence for a lymphoproliferative disorder, 4 samples (7.7%) as nondiagnostic because of insufficient cell count, 4 samples (7.7%) as suspicious for a lymphoproliferative neoplasm, and 7 samples (13.5%) as compatible with a lymphoproliferative neoplasm, most frequently a B-cell lymphoma. 7 of the 11 patients (63.6%) with a suspicious/positive FNAFC result underwent excisional biopsy for additional work up. Postoperative histopathology reports corroborated FNAFC's findings in 6 patients (85.7%), while the remaining patient's (14.3%) suspicious FNAFC result was discordant with postoperative histopathology results. The other 4 patients (36.4%) did not require excisional biopsy as the hemato-oncologist deemed the information provided by the FNAFC as sufficient for the diagnosis and treatment of an NHL in the specific clinical contexts of those patients. All patients with nondiagnostic (due to insufficient cell count), inconclusive, or negative FNAFC (ie, nondiagnostic of a lymphoproliferative disorder) were followed up for a mean follow-up period of 11.9 months (range: 61.2 months; SD: 10.2 months), during which no new lymphadenopathies/masses nor progression was observed.Conclusions FNAFC is a useful and practical supplementary tool in the diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorders in the head and neck region, principally B-cell lymphoma. While conventional FNACB offers a valuable insight into the initial work up of head and neck masses, FNAFC can routinely detect small abnormal cell populations. Furthermore, in specific clinical contexts, it can reliably diagnose NHL, thereby averting the need for an excisional biopsy in a subset of patients.",10.1177/19160216241296127,"Bandargal, Saruchi/0000-0003-3763-2119",1916-0216,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/19160216241296127,39511788

Here, inspired by the unique suction-cup structures of abalones, a novel adhesive and photo-responsive microparticle (MP) delivery system is developed to treat periodontitis through microfluidic electrospray technology. Such MPs are generated by quickly ionic cross-linking of sodium alginate together with photo-curing of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate of the distorted microfluidic droplets during their high-speed dropping into calcium chloride solution. Attributing to their unique concave structures, the abalone-inspired MPs exhibit desired underwater adhesion ability and stability under running water. In addition, due to the loading of antibiotics minocycline hydrochloride and near-infrared (NIR)-responsive black phosphorus during their fabrication, the resultant MPs can not only eradicate bacteria directly, but also realize a controllable and effective drug release upon NIR irradiation. Based on these features, it is demonstrated from in vivo periodontitis that the abalone-inspired MPs are firmly adhesive and can controlled-release drugs on the tooth, and thus have outstanding antibacterial efficacy against Porphyromonas gingivalis.

Trophic mismatches caused by changes in consumer energetics during periods of low resource availability have received far less attention, although this may be common for consumers during winter when primary producers are limited by light. Even less is understood about these dynamics in marine ecosystems, where consumers must cope with energetically costly changes in CO2-driven carbonate chemistry that will be most pronounced in cold temperatures. This may be especially important for calcified marine herbivores, such as the pinto abalone (Haliotis kamschatkana). H. kamschatkana are of high management concern in the North Pacific due to the active recreational fishery and their importance among traditional cultures, and research suggests they may require more energy to maintain their calcified shells and acid/base balance with ocean acidification. Here we use field surveys to demonstrate seasonal mismatches in the exposure of marine consumers to low pH and algal resource identity during winter in a subpolar, marine ecosystem. We then use these data to test how the effects of exposure to seasonally relevant pH conditions on H. kamschatkana are mediated by seasonal resource identity. We find that exposure to projected future winter pH conditions decreases metabolism and growth, and this effect on growth is pronounced when their diet is limited to the algal species available during winter. Our results suggest that increases in the energetic demands of pinto abalone caused by ocean acidification during winter will be exacerbated by seasonal shifts in their resources. These findings have profound implications for other marine consumers and highlight the importance of considering fluctuations in exposure and resources when inferring the emergent effects of global change.",10.1111/gcb.15449,"Donham, Emily/0000-0002-5190-0151; Kroeker, Kristy/0000-0002-5766-1999",1354-1013,1365-2486,,MAR,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15449,33350027

Although initial allergens were found to represent alien or introduced species, e.g. Bermuda grass, maize, lucerne, it later became apparent that indigenous allergens were also allergenic. Other major alien allergens which were imported into our region include oak, plane, pine and eucalyptus trees, the American, German and Oriental cockroaches, and fruits, e.g. kiwi and olive. The first truly African indigenous pollen allergen to be characterised was kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum) followed by buffalo grass (Stenotaphrum secundatum). Subsequently indigenous food allergens identified and characterised include abalone (Haliotis midae), cobra venom (Hemachatus hemachatus), mopane worms (Imbrasia belina), Rhodesian flame lily, Locusta migratoria and the African penguin (Spheniscus demersus). Several indigenous food sources are suspected to be causing food allergies in Botswana and are currently being investigated for allergenicity. In addition to the indigenous allergens described in this overview, South African researchers have also contributed to investigating and understanding the immunogenicity of other 'global allergens' such as Imbuia wood, verbena hybrida and Anisakis.

A flat pearl method in the presence of the inner-shell film was conducted to evaluate the role of matrix proteins in the initial stages of nacre biomineralization in vivo. We examined the crystals deposited on a substrate and the expression patterns of the matrix proteins in the mantle facing the substrate. In this study, the aragonite crystals nucleated on the surface at 5 days in the inner-shell film system. In the film-free system, the calcite crystals nucleated at 5 days, a new organic film covered the calcite, and the aragonite nucleated at 10 days. This meant that the nacre lamellae appeared in the inner-shell film system 5 days earlier than that in the film-free system, timing that was consistent with the maximum level of matrix proteins during the first 20 days. In addition, matrix proteins (Nacrein, MSI60, N19, N16 and Pif80) had similar expression patterns in controlling the sequential morphologies of the nacre growth in the inner-film system, while these proteins in the film-free system also had similar patterns of expression.

Then, in-vitro calcium carbonate crystallization experiments under the control of these six organic matrices were carried out in the present study. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was utilized to observe the morphology of CaCO3 and Raman spectroscopy as a powerful technique was used to distinguish the crystal polymorph. Influences of the six kinds of organic matrices on the calcium carbonate crystal growth are proposed. ASM of vaterite pearls can induce vaterite to crystallize and WSM of aragonite pearls mediates to produce aragonite crystals. The single AIM membranes of the two pearls have no pronounced effect on the CaCO3 crystallization. Additionally, the crystal size obtained with the additive of WSM of the two kinds of pearls is smaller than that with the additive of ASM. Moreover, self-assembly phenomenon in the biomineralization process and the distorted morphology calcite are observed. Current results demonstrate important aspects of matrix protein-controlled crystallization, which is beneficial to the understanding of nacre biomineralization mechanism.

Some coral planulae have symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.) that probably provide energy in addition to the lipids provisioned within the egg. However, our understanding of the influence of symbionts on the energy metabolism and survivorship of planulae remains limited. This study examines the relative roles of symbiotic dinoflagellate photosynthesis and stored lipid content in the survivorship of the developing stages of the corals Pocillopora damicornis and Montipora digitata. We found that survivorship decreased under dark conditions (i.e. no photosynthetic activity) for P. damicornis and M. digitata at 31 and 22 days after release/spawning, respectively. The lipid content of P. damicornis and M. digitata planulae showed a significant decrease, at a higher rate, under dark conditions, when compared with light conditions. When converted to energy equivalents, the available energy provided by the depletion of lipids could account for 41.9 and 84.7% of larval metabolism for P. damicornis (by day 31) and 38.4 and 90.1% for M. digitata (by day 21) under light and dark conditions, respectively. This finding indicates that not all energy requirements of the larvae are met by lipids: energy is also sourced from the photosynthetic activities of the symbiotic dinoflagellates within these larvae, especially under light conditions. In addition, the amounts of three main lipid classes (wax esters, triglycerides, and phospholipids) decreased throughout the experiment in the planulae of both species, with the wax ester content decreasing more rapidly under dark conditions than under light conditions. The observations that the planulae of both species derive considerable amounts of energy from wax esters, and that symbiotic dinoflagellates enable larvae to use their stores at lower rates, suggested that symbiotic dinoflagellates have the potential to extend larval life under light conditions.",10.1007/s00227-010-1401-0,"Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove/0000-0001-7510-6713",0025-3162,1432-1793,,JUN,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-010-1401-0,

Primary mantle cell cultures from the nacreous gastropod Haliotis tuberculata have been established as useful experimental model to investigate in vitro synthesis of both proteoglycans/glycosaminoglycans (PGs/GAGs) and collagen. First, we tested different enzymatic digestion procedures to find the method that gives the highest percentage of viable and adherent cultured cells. Enzymatic digestion with 0.1% pronase plus 0.1% collagenase was routinely used. Six days after the initiation of culture, about 80% of cells were viable, among which 20% were adherent as quantified by the MTT reduction assay. In addition, the protein synthesis estimated by [H-3]leucine incorporation remained constant during this period. For the first time, we demonstrated a de novo synthesis of PGs/GAGs and collagen in primary cultures of mantle cells. After 48 hours of labeling, among the [H-3]-D-glucosamine macromolecules synthesized, [H-3]PGs/GAGs represented 43%, divided into 45% heparan sulfate, 37% chondroitin/dermatan sulfate, and 6% hyaluronic acid. Early elution on anion-exchange chromatography of these PGs/GAGs indicated that most of them appeared as undersulfated GAG molecules. De novo synthesis of collagen represents 4.52% +/- 0.84% (SD) with respect to the total protein synthesis. Such a model will facilitate studies on the synthesis of PGs/GAGs and collagen as components of the extracellular matrix and its regulation in Mollusca.

Blooms are most common in late summer and autumn during warm, calm conditions. The first documented occurrence of a species of Gymnodinium in False Bay was recorded in April 1988. After blooming it maintained low concentrations in False Bay until it bloomed again in March 1989. Cell concentrations in excess of 10(6) cells.l-1 were recorded at various locations in False Bay and Walker Bay. The highest concentrations during both 1988 and 1989 were recorded at Gordon's Bay (17 x 10(6) cells.l-1 on 25 May 1988 and 24 x 10(6) cells.l-1 on 13 March 1989). Peak cell concentrations accompanied calm, warm weather and high sea-surface temperatures (approximately 20-degrees-C). Wind-induced mixing tended to disperse the blooms. These red tides were responsible for extensive faunal mortality, including an estimated 40 tons of abalone in the H. F. Verwoerd marine nature reserve in 1989. In addition, surfers and swimmers suffered eye, nose and throat irritations. Examination showed that the cell shape of the causative organism closely resembles Gymnodinium nagasakiense Takayama and Adachi but that it also shares characteristics with Gyrodinium aureolum Hulburt and Ptychodiscus breve (Davis) Steidinger. The effects of the toxin are not dissimilar to Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning (NSP) associated with P. breve blooms. Water quality in affected areas was examined using a sea-urchin gamete bioassay. Cell concentrations of 0,5 x 10(6) cells.l-1 were found to elicit a toxic response. The waterborne toxins were shown to be heat-sensitive.

The ecosystem-level consequences of climate adaptation are likely to be the largest in marine ecosystems, where short-lived phytoplankton with large effective population sizes make up the bulk of primary production. However, there are substantial challenges to predicting climate-driven evolution in marine systems, including multiple simultaneous axes of change and considerable heterogeneity in rates of change, as well as the biphasic life cycles of many marine metazoans, which expose different life stages to disparate sources of selection. A critical tool for addressing these challenges is experimental evolution, where populations of organisms are directly exposed to controlled sources of selection to test evolutionary responses. We review the use of experimental evolution to test the capacity to adapt to climate change stressors in marine species. The application of experimental evolution in this context has grown dramatically in the past decade, shedding light on the capacity for evolution, associated trade-offs, and the genetic architecture of stress-tolerance traits.

In the present study, transcriptomic profiles of L. vannamei hepatopancreas were explored by injecting with PBS or V. alginolyticus. Hepatopancreas morphology of L. vannamei was also assessed. The result reveals that compared with the hepatopancreas of PBS group, the storage cells (R-cell), secretory cells (B-cell) and star shaped polygonal structures of the lumen were disappeared and necrotic after challenged by V. alginolyticus at 24 h. Transcriptome data showed that a total of 314 differential expression genes were induced by V. alginolyticus, with 133 and 181 genes up-and down-regulated, respectively.

Compared to chemosynthetic drugs, ACE inhibitors derived from natural sources such as food proteins are believed to be safer for consumption and to have fewer adverse effects. Some edible mushrooms have been reported to significantly reduce blood pressure after oral administration. In addition, mushrooms are known to be rich in protein content. This makes them a potential source of ACE inhibitory peptides. Hence, the objective of the current study was to isolate and characterise ACE inhibitory peptides from an edible mushroom, Pleurotus cystidiosus. Methods: ACE inhibitory proteins were isolated from P. cystidiosus based on the bioassay guided purification steps, i.e. ammonium sulphate precipitation, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. Active fraction was then analysed by LC-MS/MS and potential ACE inhibitory peptides identified were chemically synthesized. Effect of in vitro gastrointestinal digestions on the ACE inhibitory activity of the peptides and their inhibition patterns were evaluated. Results: Two potential ACE inhibitory peptides, AHEPVK and GPSMR were identified from P. cystidiosus with molecular masses of 679.53 and 546.36 Da, respectively. Both peptides exhibited potentially high ACE inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 62.8 and 277.5 mu M, respectively. SEC chromatograms and BIOPEP analysis of these peptides revealed that the peptide sequence of the hexapeptide, AHEPVK, was stable throughout gastrointestinal digestion. The pentapeptide, GPSMR, was hydrolysed after digestion and it was predicted to release a dipeptide ACE inhibitor, GP, from its precursor. The Lineweaver-Burk plot of AHEPVK showed that this potent and stable ACE inhibitor has a competitive inhibitory effect against ACE. Conclusion: The present study indicated that the peptides from P. cystidiosus could be potential ACE inhibitors. Although these peptides had lower ACE inhibitory activity compared to commercial antihypertensive drugs, they are derived from mushroom which could be easily obtained and should have no side effects. Further in vivo studies can be carried out to reveal the clear mechanism of ACE inhibition by these peptides.",10.1186/1472-6882-13-313,"Shuib, Adawiyah Suriza/0000-0001-5525-2713",1472-6882,,,Nov-11,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-13-313,24215325

In the present study, we explore membrane order during seasonal and tidal temperature cycles and find that vesicles prepared from gill phospholipids exhibit significant seasonal differences in order that are consistent with homeoviscous adaptation and suggest winter-acclimatization to mean T-b values and summer-acclimatization to upper extreme T-b values or to large cyclic thermal fluctuations, despite repeated resubmergence in sea water at 10 degrees C during both seasons. Phospholipid vesicles prepared from the gills of mussels acclimated for 6 weeks to constant high or low temperatures in the laboratory fail to exhibit temperature-compensatory differences in order, In addition, during the summer, mussels inhabiting high intertidal sites, but not those from low sites, possess the ability to alter membrane order rapidly (within hours), This alteration of order appears to represent a mechanism designed to offset the thermal variations encountered during the tidal cycle, Thus, M. californianus have the ability to adjust membrane order on seasonal as well as hourly time scales and do so on the basis of their height in the intertidal region.",,,0022-0949,,,JUL,,9319489

However, the precise mechanisms by which interspecific variations in sequence foster these adaptive changes remain largely unknown. Here, we compare orthologs of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (cMDH) from marine molluscs adapted to temperatures ranging from -1.9 degrees C (Antarctica) to similar to 55 degrees C (South China coast) and show how amino acid usage in different regions of the enzyme (surface, intermediate depth, and protein core) varies with adaptation temperature. This eukaryotic enzyme follows some but not all of the rules established in comparisons of archaeal and bacterial proteins. To link the effects of specific amino acid substitutions with adaptive variations in enzyme thermal stability, we combined site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) and in vitro protein experimentation with in silico mutagenesis using molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) techniques. SDM and MDS methods generally but not invariably yielded common effects on protein stability. MDS analysis is shown to provide insights into how specific amino acid substitutions affect the conformational flexibilities of mobile regions (MRs) of the enzyme that are essential for binding and catalysis. Whereas these substitutions invariably lie outside of the MRs, they effectively transmit their flexibility-modulating effects to the MRs through linked interactions among surface residues. This discovery illustrates that regions of the protein surface lying outside of the site of catalysis can help establish an enzyme's thermal responses and foster evolutionary adaptation of function.",10.1073/pnas.1817455116,"DONG, Yunwei/0000-0003-4550-2322; Liao, Ming-ling/0000-0003-2997-6763; Somero, George/0000-0003-1431-6455",0027-8424,1091-6490,,Jan-08,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1817455116,30584112

Given increasing human-derived stressors acting on marine ecosystems, the need for such effective action is urgently clear. Here we explore mechanisms underlying the utility of marine reserves to reinstate trophic dynamics and to increase resilience of kelp beds against climate-driven phase shift to sea urchin barrens on the rapidly warming Tasmanian east coast. Tethering and tagging experiments were used to examine size-and shelter-specific survival of the range-extending sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii (Diadematidae) translocated to reefs inside and outside no-take Tasmanian marine reserves. Results show that survival rates of C. rodgersii exposed on flat reef substratum by tethering were approximately seven times (small urchins 10.1 times; large urchins 6.1 times) lower on protected reef within marine reserve boundaries (high abundance of large predatory-capable lobsters) compared to fished reef (large predatory lobsters absent). When able to seek crevice shelter, tag-resighting models estimated that mortality rates of C. rodgersii were lower overall but remained 3.3 times (small urchins 2.1 times; large urchins 6.4 times) higher in the presence of large lobsters inside marine reserves, with higher survival of small urchins owing to greater access to crevices relative to large urchins. Indeed, shelter was 6.3 times and 3.1 times more important to survival of small and large urchins, respectively, on reserved relative to fished reef. Experimental results corroborate with surveys throughout the range extension region, showing greater occurrence of overgrazing on high-relief rocky habitats where shelter for C. rodgersii is readily available. This shows that ecosystem impacts mediated by range extension of such habitat-modifying organisms will be heterogeneous in space, and that marine systems with a more natural complement of large and thus functional predators, as achievable within no-take reserves, will minimize local risk of phase shifts by reinstating size and habitat-specific predator-prey dynamics eroded by fishing. Importantly, our findings also highlight the crucial need to account for the influence of size dynamics and habitat complexity on rates of key predator-prey interactions when managing expectations of ecosystem-level responses within marine reserve boundaries.",10.1890/11-1587.1,"Ling, Scott/0000-0002-5544-8174; Johnson, Craig/0000-0002-9511-905X",1051-0761,1939-5582,,JUN,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/11-1587.1,22827131
"Little, MP; Rosenberg, PS; Arsham, A",Alternative stopping rules to limit tree expansion for random forest models,2022,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,12,1,,,15113,"Random forests are a popular type of machine learning model, which are relatively robust to overfitting, unlike some other machine learning models, and adequately capture non-linear relationships between an outcome of interest and multiple independent variables. There are relatively few adjustable hyperparameters in the standard random forest models, among them the minimum size of the terminal nodes on each tree. The usual stopping rule, as proposed by Breiman, stops tree expansion by limiting the size of the parent nodes, so that a node cannot be split if it has less than a specified number of observations. Recently an alternative stopping criterion has been proposed, stopping tree expansion so that all terminal nodes have at least a minimum number of observations. The present paper proposes three generalisations of this idea, limiting the growth in regression random forests, based on the variance, range, or inter-centile range. The new approaches are applied to diabetes data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and four other datasets (Tasmanian Abalone data, Boston Housing crime rate data, Los Angeles ozone concentration data, MIT servo data). Empirical analysis presented herein demonstrate that the new stopping rules yield competitive mean square prediction error to standard random forest models. In general, use of the intercentile range statistic to control tree expansion yields much less variation in mean square prediction error, and mean square prediction error is also closer to the optimal.

It is harvested in Mexico in small amounts for abalone farm fodder and occasionally exported to Asia for human consumption. Because the high-energy environment where it naturally grows limits its sustainable harvest, we explored the domestication and cultivation of this kelp on the west coast of Baja California, Mexico. The life history of E. arborea was completed in the laboratory following traditional methods for kelp cultivation. Gametophytes became reproductive approximately 50 days after spore release and sporophytes were visible to the naked eye after 80 days. When sporophytes reached 2-3 cm, they were transplanted to two sites on long-line systems: in an open bay (Todos Santos Bay) and in a shallow coastal lagoon (San Quintin Bay). At both sites, full differentiation occurred 6 to 8 months after deployment, with fertile blades occurring within a year. Once individuals reached maximum size, blades were harvested by pruning. Monthly, regrowth of pruned blades and new blade addition were measured. Pruned individuals reached the same weight as controls in three months. On the basis of these results, a seasonal seeding program was implemented at a third site where the presence of natural Eisenia is rare due to the lack of hard substrate but was hypothesized to provide appropriate conditions for kelp cultivation (Santa Maria Bay). Cultures were deployed at three different depths and growth was correlated with season, depth, and temperature. Only cultures seeded in winter developed successfully at this site. This study shows that the culture of E. arborea in a variety of ocean conditions is possible; however, site selection and seasonality are important considerations. Because E. arborea is perennial, it can be harvested periodically during the year thereby increasing yield, and because it is the warmest tolerant kelp species, it is an ideal target for ocean farming and commercial cultivation, considering climate change.",10.3389/fmars.2022.932534,"Ladah, Lydia/0000-0003-4009-4817; ZERTUCHE-GONZALEZ, JOSE ANTONIO/0000-0002-9748-9820; Sandoval Gil, Jose Miguel/0000-0001-8973-0306",,2296-7745,,Aug-24,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.932534,

Methods: The AOAC INTERNATIONAL guidelines for the validation of qualitative binary chemistry methods were followed. Three different PST profiles (mixtures) were used, of which two were commonly found in naturally contaminated lobster hepatopancreas (high in gonyautoxin 2&3 and saxitoxin), and the third toxin profile was observed in a few select animals (high in gonyautoxin 1&4).

Bioremediation systems based on coupled bioturbation-microbial processing offer a promising route for waste management. We present, for the first time, a combined biogeochemical-molecular analysis of the short-term performance of one such system that is designed to receive nitrogen-rich particulate aquaculture wastes. Using sea cucumbers (Holothuria scabra) as a model bioturbator we provide evidence that adjusting the waste C : N from 5 : 1 to 20:1 promoted a shift in nitrogen cycling pathways towards the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), resulting in net NH4+ efflux from the sediment. The carbon amended treatment exhibited an overall net N-2 uptake, whereas the control receiving only aquaculture waste exhibited net N-2 production, suggesting that carbon supplementation enhanced nitrogen fixation. The higher NH4+ efflux and N-2 uptake was further supported by meta-genome predictions that indicate that organic-carbon addition stimulated DNRA over denitrification. These findings indicate that carbon addition may potentially result in greater retention of nitrogen within the system; however, longer-term trials are necessary to determine whether this nitrogen retention is translated into improved sea cucumber biomass yields. Whether this truly constitutes a remediation process is open for debate as there remains the risk that any increased nitrogen retention may be temporary, with any subsequent release potentially raising the eutrophication risk.

In this paper the performances of hybrid two-stage methods combining self-organising map (SOM) and traditional clustering algorithms are presented and evaluated with the goal of identifying the techniques leading to the best clustering quality. The SOM-based two-stage methods are also compared to single-stage approaches applying traditional hierarchical and partitioning algorithms. These comparisons are initially based on the analysis of two reference data sets ( Iris and Abalone) which shows how the use of SOM improves clustering quality while reducing computational time. In order to further evaluate the proposed two-stage method, the comparison is extended to two industrial applications. The first one concerns the group technology problem and the second is related to the classification of purchased components.

We compared sporophyte-initiation and -growth in two populations from northern and southern Chile (Bahia Inglesa and Maicolpue) under laboratory conditions. Irradiance and temperature were the most important factors affecting gametophyte development. Meiospores harvested in spring exhibited maximum reproductive and growth potential, while spores released during autumn were moribund, and died within a few days. In both study sites, we found evidence for acclimation: Meiospores collected in summer required higher levels of irradiance and temperature for maximum development than winter spores. Juvenile sporophytes from both localities responded similarly to temperature and/or irradiance. The best conditions for recruitment of sporophytes from both localities were 15 degrees C and white fluorescent light of 4070molm2s1.

In this study we addressed the question of how the cryptic nature of juvenile T. niloticus can affect survival estimates in experiments to investigate seeding as a tool to enhance overfished stocks. We compared recapture rates of cultured trochus with only a numbered tag with that of flagged trochus, which had both a tag and an additional bright coloured piece of tape glued to the shelf. One experiment was done at Orpheus Island in Australia, and another at Moso Island in Vanuatu. For each experiment the areas were censused 2 or 3 days after release. At Orpheus Island, 76% of the flagged trochus were recaptured compared with 52% of the unflagged trochus. Corresponding values for Moso Island were 68% for flagged trochus and 56% for unflagged trochus. This pattern of higher recapture of flagged trochus was highly consistent among experimental plots, supporting the hypothesis that a significant proportion of the trochus are overlooked by the observer. Mean sighting probability of trochus after 2-3 days was 0.69 at Orpheus Island for an average size of 23 mm shell width (SW), and 0.81 at Moso Island for an average juvenile size of 30 mm SW. Without appropriate correction, survival rates could be underestimated by 30% at Orpheus Island and 19% at Moso Island. As indicated by our results, sighting probability will vary with locality and size.

"Hart, AM","Commercial scale invertebrate fisheries enhancement in Australia: Experiences, challenges and opportunities",2015,MARINE POLICY,62,,82,93,,"Stock enhancement or assisted recruitment for fisheries management in Australia is at an experimental R&D phase. Development of the science has focused largely on finfish targeted by the recreational sector; however it is considered that high value invertebrates will be the best candidates for commercial scale fisheries enhancement. Three main ingredients are required; technical capacity, governance capability, and the 'correct' species. The technical capacity needed is in the area of hatchery production and wild release methodologies, whilst the governance capability needed is informed policy that accounts for the complexities and interdisciplinary nature of stock enhancement. In particular, the appropriate articulation of policy to support economic development and integration into wild fisheries is currently lacking. If successful stock enhancement is implemented, the nature of fisheries management changes because the recruitment side of the fisheries equation is under substantial control, rather than just the production side. Management responses will require significant innovation, with a renewed emphasis on understanding the stock, rather than policing the fishers. By way of illustration, recent initiatives and key challenges encountered in Australian invertebrate fisheries are investigated through case studies. An example of a commercially-viable enhancement fishery that reflects solutions to the key challenges is also presented. The review ends with an argument to re-establish the context of stock enhancement in the discipline of ecological enhancement. This is a crucial and positive step forward for it recognises that, in principle, any renewable aquatic ecosystem has the potential to be enhanced instead of just depleted.

We initiated a breeding program to improve the heat tolerance of the C. gigas by backcrossing with the heat-adapted congeneric species, Crassostrea angulata. In addition, the parents of each generation of the backcross were selected by exposing to acute stress of extreme high temperature. The summer survival rate of the selected backcross populations (BC1, BC2 and BC3 representing different generations) were significantly higher than that of C. gigas. Compared to C. gigas heat stress at 37 degrees C for 12 h, BC3 exhibited significantly lower oxygen consumption rates and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, which indicated that the selected backcross populations exhibited superior tolerance to high-temperature conditions. Additionally, the phylogenetic analysis results demonstrate that the selected backcross populations were distinctly separable from the C. gigas, and 11 candidate genes (Aldo, GPX, PKA, glpK, AGK, DGK, sPLA2, Pcyt2, PARP, TRAF2, and VDAC1) mediating heat tolerance differentiation were identified through selective sweep analysis and gene expression differentiation analysis between populations with divergent heat tolerance. Our results confirm that the breeding strategy of interspecies backcrossing in combination with artificial selection will not only offer breeding approach for genetic improvement for the heat tolerance of the C. gigas, but also provide new insights into the genetic basis of heat tolerance traits for marine animals.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2025.742331,,0044-8486,1873-5622,,May-30,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2025.742331,

However, it remains unclear whether differences in pathogenicity between different V. mediterranei strains are associated with ECP compositions. In this study, genomics and proteomics approaches were integrated to compare the virulence factors in the ECP proteins secreted by two high-virulence V. mediterranei strains and one low-virulence strain. We found that the ECPs secreted by high-virulence V. mediterranei strains had a greater number and variety of virulence factors compared to low-virulence strains, and that 73 of the 95 specific ECP proteins in the high-virulence strains were not expressed in the low-virulence strain. These findings provide further insights into the role that virulent ECPs play in the pathogenesis of V. mediterranei to bivalves. Abstract Vibrio mediterranei, a bacterial pathogen of bivalves, has exhibited strain-dependent virulence. The mechanisms behind the variations in bivalve pathogenicity between V. mediterranei strains have remained unclear. However, a preliminary analysis of the extracellular product (ECP) proteomes has revealed differences in protein compositions between low- and high-virulence strains; in addition to 1265 shared proteins, 127 proteins have been identified to be specific to one low-virulence strain and 95 proteins to be specific to two high-virulence strains. We further studied the ECP proteins of the three V. mediterranei strains from functional perspectives using integrated genomics and proteomics approaches. The results showed that lipid metabolism, transporter activity and membrane transporter pathways were more enriched in the ECPs of the two high-virulence strains than in those of the low-virulence strain. Additionally, 73 of the 95 high-virulence strain-specific proteins were found to have coding genes in the genome but were not expressed in the low-virulence strain. Moreover, comparisons with known virulence factors in the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB) and the Pathogen-Host Interactions Database (PHI-base) allowed us to predict more than 10 virulence factors in the categories of antimicrobial activity/competitive advantage, the effector delivery system and immune modulation, and the high-virulence strain-specific ECP proteins consisted of a greater percentage of known virulence factors than the low-virulence strain. Particularly, two virulence factors, MtrC and KatG, were identified in the ECPs of the two high-virulence strains but not in those of the low-virulence strain. Most coding genes of the ECP proteins including known virulence factors were identified on chromosome 1 of V. mediterranei. Our findings indicate that variations in virulence factor composition in the bacterial ECPs may partially account for the differences in the bivalve pathogenicity between V. mediterranei strains.",10.3390/ani14050692,"Zhang, Haiyan/0000-0002-6968-0302",2076-2615,,,MAR,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani14050692,38473077

Recently, a TRIzol-based protein extraction method has gained prominence and has attracted attention due to its promising performance in high-quality 2-DE. The authors evaluate the use of this approach for four valuable dried food products, namely two dried seafood products (abalone slices and whelk slices) and two traditional Chinese tonic foods (ganoderma and caterpillar fungus). The results indicate that 2-DE gels obtained through the TRIzol-based method are of high-quality and are comparable to those obtained through the trichloroacetic acid-acetone method in terms of spot number, spot intensity, and resolution. The TRIzol-based method is generally applicable to dried food samples and is simple and fast, which greatly streamlines the protein extraction procedure.

However its merits cannot be fully embodied by its current synthesis approaches, since most of them were normally tedious, costly, low yield or environment unfriendly, and poor in controlling multiple parameters of MnO2. Inspired by biopolymer-assisted synthesis of hierarchical inorganic materials in living systems, a marine biopolymer was used for structure-controllable synthesis of MnO2 in this study. Functioning as the reductant, surfactant and directing agent, alginate could tune the hierarchical architecture of MnO2 in multiple parameters including the dimension, nanometric size, crystallographic form and porosity, where delta-MnO2 nanocrystals with the size of 5 similar to 10 nm first assembled into nanosheets, and then flower-like structure with particle size tunable within 40 similar to 200 nm as well as micro-and mesopores. Due to these unique hierarchies in both the morphology and porosity, as-prepared MnO2 exhibited excellent performance as SC electrode, e.g. high power density (32.5 kW kg(-1)), high energy density (75.1 Wh kg(-1)) and great cycling stability. Given the green, low-temperature and scalable one-step process, this synthesis may pave a highly promising way to massive production of MnO2 electrode materials for SCs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Reliable culture techniques that provide high growth and survival rates for juvenile snails have been established; however, additional research is needed to improve breeding in captivity. The goals of this study were to efficiently relax the snails to identify the sex in order to conduct a study to understand the effect of different sex ratios on reproductive output. Of the seven chemical solutions used to relax the snails, benzocaine mixed in methanol was the most effective. To examine the effect of sex ratio, 10 snails were stocked into 75 L tanks within a recirculating aquaculture system at the ratios of 3 F:7 M, 5 F:5 M, 7 F:3 M, and 8 F:2 M for 8 weeks. There was a significant positive relationship between the number of egg clutches produced and a higher number of females in the tank. However, there were no significant differences in the number of eggs per clutch, egg diameter, percent hatch rates, female production (egg clutches per female per week), or the number of juvenile snails produced per female. The number of copulations was observed for the first three weeks of the experiment. When standardized to the number of copulations per male snails, no significant differences between treatments were detected. Our results suggest that a female-biased sex ratio may prove optimal and cost effective for large-scale captive breeding production. Future studies should determine the minimal proportion of males needed to limit the loss of genetic diversity in a female-biased stock enhancement program. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

Water-soluble proteins were extracted from nacre of the sea snail Haliotis laevigata by dissolving the mineral phase with 6% acetic acid. The influence of this protein mixture on CaCO3 precipitation rates was investigated at different concentrations. A well-established assay for measuring the pH-value during CaCO3 precipitation with and without protein additives was extended by calculating maximum precipitation rates from the pH-values. It could be shown that precipitation rates are greatly influenced by the mixtures of water-soluble nacre proteins. At very low protein concentrations (0.02 mu g/ml) a rate enhancement in comparison to the pure supersaturated calcium carbonate solution by a factor of 1.4 was observed. At higher protein concentrations, a strong inhibitory effect occurred, with total inhibition at concentrations of 1.0 mu g/ml and higher. Two unspecific proteins (bovine serum albumin and lysozyme) showed little or no modification of precipitation rates. In vivo, the function of the strong inhibition of CaCO3 precipitation by nacre proteins at higher concentrations is presumably to prevent uncontrolled crystallization in the extrapallial fluid.

There are, however, several constraints to consider throughout much of the Pacific, including, transport problems, fragile ecosystems, lack of suitable sites, limited economies, and the effects of customary marine tenure on access to growout sites. To overcome these problems, coastal aquaculture in the Pacific will need to focus either on species of high value, or those that yield non-perishable products. Valuable industries have been established for pearl oysters, penaeid shrimps, and the microalgae, Spirulina, in tropical Australia, the French territories and Hawaii, whereas enterprises for cultured giant clams, milkfish (Chanos chanos) as tuna bait, the macroalgae, Eucheuma, and sponges are emerging in the small island developing states. Species demanded by the aquarium trade, groupers for live reef fish markets, tropical abalone (Haliotidae), mangrove crabs (Scylla spp.) and a variety of invertebrates as sources of bioactive compounds are promising new species for intensive farming. Aquaculture technology is being applied to the restocking and stock enhancement of valuable, sedentary species low in the food chain, and there are active programmes in several small island developing states to assess the scope for releasing cultured giant clams, trochus, green snail and sea cucumbers to replenish and enhance wild stocks.

Trochus were released at different sizes (6-12, 16-27 nun) and densities (2-8 m(2)) at replicated sites in each region. Populations at those sites were subsequently compared with those at unseeded controls. Temporal variation in success was also assessed by repeating the experiment in Indonesia. Initial survival was monitored by tagging the juveniles with aluminium foil and recapturing them using underwater metal detectors. The majority of juveniles released in Australia and Indonesia died or disappeared within a month of release and stocks were not enhanced relative to controls. Predation, especially by fish, was considered likely to be the most important cause of loss, but further investigation is required. Losses in Vanuatu were also substantial, but up to 4.4% of 10-27 mm juveniles were recaptured alive after 12 months.

We aimed to investigate the response of burial and sources of sedimentary organic carbon (SOC) to the mariculture activities and regional environmental changes on a centennial scale. Sediment chronology results showed that the sediment cores in the abalone culture area and control area covered a period of 45 years (1971-2016), and 120 years (1896-2016). The sediment accumulation rate in the abalone culture area and control area were 0.95 cm.a(-1) and 0.30 cm.a(-1), respectively. And the TOC and TN burial fluxes in the abalone culture area (35.41 +/- 0.25 g.m(-2).a(-1) and 4.58 +/- 1.70 g.m(-2).a(-1), respectively) were about 5 and 7 times higher than those in the control area (7.03 +/- 1.39 g.m(-2).a(-1) and 0.72 +/- 0.17 g.m(-2).a(-1), respectively), respectively.

Current understanding of virulence in V. harveyi is limited by strain-specific variability and complex host-pathogen dynamics. This study sought to integrate genomic investigation, phenotypic characterisation and in vivo challenge trials in barramundi (Lates calcarifer) to increase our understanding of V. harveyi virulence. We identified two hypervirulent isolates, Vh-14 and Vh-15 that caused 100% mortality in fish within 48 hours, and that were phenotypically and genotypically distinct from other V. harveyi isolates. Virulent isolates contained multiple plasmids, including a 105,412 bp conjugative plasmid with type III secretion system genes originally identified in Yersinia pestis. The emergence of this hypervirulent plasmid-mediated patho-variant poses a potential threat to the sustainable production of marine finfish in Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean and Australia. In addition, we observed an effect of temperature on phenotypic indicators of virulence with an increase in activity at 28 degrees C and 34 degrees C compared to 22 degrees C. This suggests that temperature fluctuations associated with climate change may act as a stressor on bacteria, increasing virulence gene secretion and host adaptation.

In this study, we investigated the responses of the larvae of the ascidian Herdmania curvata to haliclonacyclamine A (HA), the major component of a suite of cytotoxic alkaloids extracted from the sponge Haliclona sp. 628. Both Haliclona sp. 628 and Herdmania curvata inhabit the crest and slope of Heron Island Reef. High rates of settlement were induced in competent H. curvata larvae by a range of concentrations of HA, all lower than that naturally occurring in the sponge. HA did not induce precompetent larvae to settle. Although early metamorphosis of HA-induced larvae was normal, larvae exposed to all but the lowest concentration of HA were developmentally arrested after completion of tail resorption, at about 4 h after the initiation of metamorphosis. These postlarvae underwent extensive cellular necrosis within 24 h. We also demonstrate that the addition of a transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D, to larvae also causes inhibition of metamorphosis after tail resorption is completed. Analyses of incorporation of radiolabelled nucleotides to measure levels of transcription during normal development and after the addition of the transcriptional inhibitor indicate that there is a significant burst of transcriptional activity just after tail resorption is completed. Despite inhibiting metamorphosis at the same stage as actinomycin D, HA increases initial rates of RNA synthesis after induction of metamorphosis in a manner similar to that observed in normal postlarvae until the onset of cellular necrosis. We conclude that HA initially induces H. curvata larvae to settle and progress through early metamorphosis possibly by engaging the same pathway as other artificial and environmental cues but subsequently inhibits completion of metamorphosis, resulting in death of the postlarvae. Since HA does not affect overall transcription rates, it appears to disrupt another important developmental process during early metamorphosis.",10.1007/s002270100698,"Jones, Malcolm/0000-0002-0035-6141; Degnan, Bernard/0000-0001-7573-8518; Russell, Bayden/0000-0003-1282-9978; Clark, Richard/0000-0002-6807-5426; Skilleter, Greg/0000-0002-4719-0409",0025-3162,,,FEB,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002270100698,

These feedbacks are part of complex social-ecological systems (SES), in which resources, actors, and governance systems interact to produce outcomes across these component parts. Qualitative modeling approaches offer ways to assess complex SES dynamics. Loop analysis in particular is useful for examining and identifying potential outcomes from external perturbations and management interventions in data poor systems when very little is known about functional relationships and parameter values. Using a case study of multispecies, multifleet coastal small-scale fisheries, we demonstrate the application of loop analysis to provide predictions regarding SES responses to perturbations and management actions. Specifically, we examine the potential ecological and socioeconomic consequences to coastal fisheries of different governance interventions (e.g., territorial user rights, fisheries closures, market-based incentives, ecotourism subsidies) and environmental changes. Our results indicate that complex feedbacks among biophysical and socioeconomic components can result in counterintuitive and unexpected outcomes. For example, creating new jobs through ecotourism or subsidies might have mixed effects on members of fishing cooperatives vs. nonmembers, highlighting equity issues. Market-based interventions, such as ecolabels, are expected to have overall positive economic effects, assuming a direct effect of ecolabels on marketprices, and a lack of negative biological impacts under most model structures. Our results highlight that integrating ecological and social variables in a unique unit of management can reveal important potential trade-offs between desirable ecological and social outcomes, highlight which user groups might be more vulnerable to external shocks, and identify which interventions should be further tested to identify potential win-win outcomes across the triple-bottom line of the sustainable development paradigm.",10.5751/ES-08825-220134,"Micheli, Fiorenza/0000-0002-6865-1438",1708-3087,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ES-08825-220134,

These are the first triploid sea urchins of any species that have been produced at any life stage and represent an initial step in a larger effort to yield triploid adult green sea urchins for large-scale land-based and near-shore commercial aquaculture ventures. Following fertilization, triploid mollusks and fish result by preventing release of the second polar body. Adult triploids in all of these organisms are sterile and may be larger than diploids based on accelerated growth of somatic tissues. Similar methods are impossible for sea urchins since haploid (1n) ova are released from the ovary after completion of both meiotic divisions. We have produced triploid green sea urchin embryos (3n = 63) by fusing two in ova (each n =21) and fertilizing the diploid products of these fusions with highly diluted spermatozoa (n = 21). Mechanical, proteolytic and acidic treatments were employed to remove the jelly coat and vitelline membrane prior to fusion. Results indicate that acidic removal of the extracellular structures, subsequent fusion with poly(Arg) in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and fertilization with highly diluted sperm yield 60.64 +/- 1.39% triploid embryos that reach prism pluteus stage (with spicules). Triploidy was verified at all developmental stages by counting chromosomes. We discuss scaling up our laboratory methods for embryos to the hatchery environment and also issues unique to the reproductive biology of sea urchins that will be vital for commercial aquaculture ventures to consider if triploid adult green sea urchins can ultimately be produced.

"Chapman, MG; Smoothey, AF",Sea urchins provide habitat for rare chitons in intertidal boulder-fields,2014,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,459,,31,37,,"Sea urchins provide habitat for many other invertebrates and fish which live in association with the spines or tests of the urchins. In boulder-fields in New South Wales, Australia, there is a large suite of chitons of the genus Ischnochiton, most of which show very overdispersed patterns of abundance among boulders, with many individuals aggregated onto few boulders. Most species are too sparse to manipulate experimentally to test hypotheses about their strong patterns of association with particular boulders, but the most common species, Ischnochiton australis, is strongly associated with the urchin, Heliocidaris erythrogramma, at two spatial scales. The two species occurred together on boulders more than expected by chance and, on boulders occupied by both species, abundances were positively correlated. In addition, I. australis were predominantly found under the spines and tests of the urchins. These patterns were general in time and space. Despite the relative rarity of the chiton, experiments were done to test hypotheses about the presence of each species influencing dispersal among boulders of the other species. Sample size was necessarily small because the chitons are not widespread among the boulders and not all experimental treatments and procedural controls could be included due to limited habitat containing chitons and urchins. Nevertheless, replicate small experiments showed that chitons decreased in abundance under boulders from which urchins had been removed, more than under boulders with chitons, although not all tests were significant. Urchins, in contrast, showed no effects of removal of chitons. Thus, it is likely that urchins provide habitat for chitons, rather than the reverse. Therefore, removal of urchins from these habitats by harvesting could have large negative effects on abundances of this relatively rare intertidal chiton, which appears to be a habitat-specialist. These experiments should offer insight into responses to habitat-needs for other rare molluscs and provide guidance on the value of experimental tests of habitat-specificity for rare species, even when rarity itself reduces the scope of the experimental treatments that can be used.

We analyzed sea star counts, biomass, size distributions, and recruitment from long-term intertidal monitoring sites from San Diego to Alaska to assess regional trends in sea star recovery following the outbreak. Recruitment, an indicator of population recovery, has been spatially patchy and varied within and among regions of the coast. Despite sea star counts approaching predisease numbers, sea star biomass, a measure of predation potential on the mussel Mytilus californianus, has remained low. This indicates that post-outbreak populations have not regained their full predation pressure. The regional variability in percent of recovering sites suggested differences in factors promoting sea star recovery between regions but did not show consistent patterns in postoutbreak recruitment on a coast-wide scale.

On Santa Rosa Island (SRI), there is evidence for intensive settlement associated with greater sedentism along the relatively wet and productive northwest coast. We use faunal, chronological, and stable oxygen isotopic ( delta 18 O) data from middle Holocene interior residential base sites to reconstruct patterns of mobility between the coast and the interior of the island. Most of the interior sites on SRI dating to this period are oriented toward the northwest coast and previous isotopic studies have indicated they were used seasonally to access terrestrial plant resources and fresh water from fog. This is supported by the faunal record from CA -SRI50, which was occupied during the summer and fall and has a low -diversity faunal record associated with field processing prior to transporting marine foods to the site. CA -SRI -152 and -229, however, are two sites oriented toward the southwest coast, an area that is drier and less productive overall, but contained a high abundance of red abalone ( Haliotis rufescens ). These sites appear to have additional roles, including as stopover locations, reflected by a lower density but more diverse faunal record with settlement focused on the spring. This study indicates that the structure of interior residential bases on the NCI during the middle Holocene was not monolithic and that people traveled to the interior for different purposes. By understanding the diversity of sites in the context of environmental variability during the middle Holocene, we can better reconstruct patterns of seasonal mobility and site use during an important period of change that contributed to the eventual development of coastal hunter -gatherer -fisher social complexity.",10.1016/j.quaint.2023.10.011,,1040-6182,1873-4553,,Apr-20,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2023.10.011,

Like many other oyster species, diploid C. hongkongensis undergo slow growth and high mortality during gametogenesis. Promoting the commercial culturing of triploids may be one way to solve these problems. We present the first study of the effects of ploidy, site and their interaction on the grow-out traits of C. hongkongensis reaching market size. According to our results, triploid larvae grew significantly faster (P < 0.05) than diploids, but there was no significant difference in survival rate between diploid and triploid larvae. Within each site, triploids often had higher shell height than diploids (P < 0.05), and there were significant differences (P < 0.001) in shell height among sites. Additionally, there were significant differences (P < 0.001) in whole weight based on both site and ploidy, but no significant interactions between site and ploidy were observed. The incremental survival rates of triploids were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those of diploids in December 2015, April 2016, August 2016 and April 2017, likely because triploids appeared less sensitive to environmental variations and displayed an obviously lower degree of gonad development than diploids. Moreover, there were significant differences (P < 0.05) in incremental survival rate among sites, suggesting that variations in environmental conditions may have great impacts on the survival rate of C. hongkongensis. In the reproductive phase, the relative expressions of the genes belonging to the insulin-like pathway were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in diploid C. hongkongensis, which is likely related to the high-energy consumption of gametogenesis in diploids. In the non-reproductive phase, the significantly higher (P < 0.05) expressions of insulin-like pathway genes in triploid C. hongkongensis matched their significantly faster growth, which may provide a new explanation for this fast growth of triploids.

Since its appearance in NSW in 2010, OsHV-1 microvariant has prevented the farming of Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) in the affected estuaries near Sydney, following the initial massive outbreaks(1,2). The arrival of the disease in southeast Tasmania in January 2016 has put the entire $53M industry in Australia in jeopardy(3). The virus is a member of the Family Malacoherpesviridae(4), which includes several invertebrate herpesviruses. The OsHV-1 genome consists of 207 439 base pairs, with organisation similar to that of mammalian herpesviruses. However, OsHV-1 contains two invertible unique regions (U-L, 167.8 kbp; U-S, 3.4 kbp) each flanked by inverted repeats (TRL/IRL, 7.6 kbp; TRS/IRS, 9.8 kbp), with an additional unique sequence (X, 1.5 kbp) between IRL and IRS4. Unlike many herpesviruses which are host specific, OsHV-1 strains have been transmitted between marine bivalve species(5) and the virus is transmitted indirectly. The virus may have relatively prolonged survival in the environment, has extremely high infection and case fatality rates, and latency is unproven. Along with pilchard herpesvirus(6-8) and abalone ganglioneuritis virus(9,10), it is part of a dawning reality that marine herpesviruses are among the most virulent of pathogens.

Several approaches have been developed to understand protein-associated mechanisms of nacre formation, yet we still lack insight into how protein ensembles or proteomes manage nucleation and crystal growth. To provide additional insights, we have created a proportionally defined combinatorial model consisting of two nacre-associated proteins, C-RING AP7 (shell nacre, Haliotis rufescens) and pseudo-EF hand PFMG1 (oyster pearl nacre, Pinctada fucata), whose individual in vitro mineralization functionalities are well-documented and distinct from one another. Using scanning electron microscopy, flow cell scanning transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, Ca(II) potentiometric titrations, and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring quantitative analyses, we find that both nacre proteins are functionally active within the same mineralization environments and, at 1:1 molar ratios, synergistically create calcium carbonate mesoscale structures with ordered intracrystalline nanoporosities, extensively prolong nucleation times, and introduce an additional nucleation event. Further, these two proteins jointly create nanoscale protein aggregates or phases that under mineralization conditions further assemble into protein-mineral polymer-induced liquid precursor-like phases with enhanced ACC stabilization capabilities, and there is evidence of intermolecular interactions between AP7 and PFMG1 under these conditions.

However, current liquid formulations have short shelf life and high risk of bacterial contamination. The aim of our study was to develop a stable functional formulation. Analytical techniques (nano-differential scanning calorimetry and spectroscopy) and biological assays (cytotoxicity and plaque reduction) were employed to measure the effect of sugar addition on the physical properties and shelf life of the solid formulated hemocyanin. Sucrose improved thermal stability significantly by both increasing the aggregation onset temperature (70 degrees C to >78 degrees C) and enhancing the activation energy (18%). Lyophilisation without trehalose caused degradation and unfolding of the alpha-helices of hemocyanin. However, the addition of an optimal proportion of trehalose:protein (5:1 by weight) prevented the degradation and unfolding during lyophilisation, hence maintained the protein solubility. The estimated ED50 values of the formulated solid (0.43 +/- 0.1) and liquid samples (0.37 +/- 0.06) were similar in magnitude, and were significantly lower than the respective controls; thus, confirming enhanced antiviral activity of the formulation. Formulated compounds were stable for six months at 5 degrees C storage. The enhanced shelf life and stable antiviral activity of the formulation offers its significant potential as effective therapeutic agent in future clinical applications.

In addition, we have studied COE function with knockdown experiments in S. purpuratus, which indicate that COE is likely to be involved in repressing serotonergic cell fate in the apical ganglion of dipleurula larvae.

In the Abrolhos Archipelago, the vermetid Dendropoma irregulare (d'Orbigny, 1842) associated with the CCA Porolithon pachydermum (Foslie) Foslie, represents a significant portion of the reef edges. This study aimed to analyze the seasonal influence of the substrate and hydrodynamic exposure to vermetid D. irregulare settlement, and to verify if the biological cues might be acting in the vermetid settlement. Seasonal in situ settlement experiments were performed, testing different substrata (live coralline algae, dead coralline algae, and artificial substrate) in three study sites (Mato Verde, Caldeiros, and Siriba) and a seasonal exposure index was calculated. We found that P. pachydermum enhance settlement of D. irregulare in the Abrolhos reefs. The vermetid settlements were significantly higher on (1) substrates with live CCA, and (2) in the presence of substrates with live CCA cues. The highest vermetid settlements, which best reveal the positive effect of substrate cues (live coralline algae), were observed at Siriba during summer and autumn-winter, being more than twice that recorded in Mato Verde. It is suggested that features associated with live coralline surfaces may attract the settlement of the juvenile vermetid. This study revealed a significant positive correlation between settlements of the vermetid on live CCA and the degree of exposure to hydrodynamics, where the highest densities were observed in a moderate condition of exposure. Responses to the preferential settlement on live coralline algae surfaces in the present study are probably due to a complex of cues acting simultaneously, which includes the physical (hydrodynamics) and biological cues (biofilms). This study provides the first attempt to examination of the settlement factors of the vermetids, contributing to the role that live coralline may play as nursery habitats in the Abrolhos Archipelago. Because of its ability to induce settlement of the crawling juvenile vermetid, CCA play a fundamental role in the life cycle of many marine invertebrates, including D. irregulare.

Disease had devastating effects on both wild and restored populations, but dynamics were highly variable and appeared to be site-specific with no significant differences in disease prevalence between wild versus restored sites. A subset of 20 haphazardly selected colonies at each site observed over a four-month period revealed widely varying disease incidence, although not between restored and wild sites, and a case fatality rate of 8%. A tropical storm was the only discernable environmental trigger associated with a consistent spike in incidence across all sites.

The presence and level of the perforin-like mRNA correlate with the ability of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) to eliminate intracellular bacteria. In addition, siRNA knockdown of the perforin-like molecule abolishes bactericidal activity and allows intracellular bacterial replication. Complementation of MEF in which the endogenous perforin-like molecule has been knocked down with a red fluorescent protein-tagged version restores bactericidal activity. The perforin-like molecule has broad bactericidal specificity for pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, including Gram-positive and -negative, and acid fast bacteria.

BRD has been diagnosed in Ireland on only one occasion (1997) although the aetiological agent has recently been detected in apparently healthy Manila clams from a number of sites around the Irish coast. The present work investigated the susceptibilities to BRD of two stocks of Manila clams, one from Ireland and the second from Galicia, north-western Spain, where BRD has been reported on a number of occasions. Exposure of the clams was by addition of V. tapetis to the holding waters. Development of BRD was assessed by the appearance of brown ring signs on the host shells, by bacterial isolation and characterization, and by detection of the bacterium by PCR. The pathogen was recovered from infected individuals and confirmed as V. tapetis by biochemical tests and a slide agglutination test. Galician clams experienced significantly higher mortalities, BRD prevalences and V. tapetis levels than Irish clams. Background infection with V. tapelis in the control stocks prevented conclusions being drawn on comparative susceptibility of the two stocks. Irish clams were significantly affected by the experimental challenge, as demonstrated by the development of BRD and an increase in V. tapetis levels.

Each occupational phase repeats a pattern of escalating use of fish and the wavy top snail over time, followed by abrupt declines in the use of these resources, signaling the onset of short-term inter-occupational hiatuses. Why each occupational phase declined is not known, nor can the nature of the inter-occupational hiatuses be discerned. However, while the overall pattern of subsistence procurement is the same in each phase, proportional use of the principal resources varies between the occupations, indicating changes over time in resource availability. A variety of warm-water fish species in the archaeofauna suggests that the cyclic occupations might reflect seasonal use of the site or that the hiatuses could have been responses to broader climatic episodes, such as droughts or El Ninos that would have had negative effects on the availability of environmentally sensitive taxa.

The oceanographic features of the two zones are markedly different, with influence of the Humboldt Current in the north, and the Cape Horn Current System, together with freshwater influxes, in the Magellanic zone. Both regions were surveyed twice during 2013 by SCUBA diving and pulling ropes and aquaculture cages. Both artificial structures and natural communities were sampled. A total of 22 species were identified, three of them reported for the first time in Chilean waters: Lissoclinum perforatum, Synoicum georgianum, and Polyzoa minor. The first is an introduced species found here for the first time in the Pacific. No species occurred in both regions, highlighting the very different environmental conditions of subantarctic vs. temperate waters. In spite of exhaustive searches in aquaculture facilities and on artificial structures such as harbour docks and piers, no introduced species were found in the Punta Arenas area. Conversely, 5 out of 11 (45%) species found in northern Chile were introduced. The Coquimbo area has a history of ship traffic dating back at least 150 years, and cultures of native (e.g. scallop) as well as exotic species (e.g. abalone) have been deployed for ca. 35 years. Some of the introduced species, such as Ciona robusta (formerly C. intestinalis sp. A), constitute pests for scallop culture facilities in the area, causing serious losses to local farmers. It is surprising that the Punta Arenas zone, with a history of ship traffic dating back ca. 500 years and over 25 years of sustained mussel and salmon aquaculture activity, is apparently free from introduced species. The ascidian cover on artificial structures is high, but it is made up of native species such as Paramolgula sp., Cnemidocarpa verrucosa, or Polyzoa opuntia.

However, outlier detection is challenged due to data scarcity and abnormal system behaviour. These limitations are resolved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) which has significant attention with the capacity of new data generation. In this paper, the novel outlier detection approach Adaptive Mine Blast Optimization (AMBO) GAN is proposed for differentiating the fake data from the original one. GAN improves the data quality and efficiency by correcting errors and reducing the noise. GAN involves iterative backup loop between generator and descriminator. The network loss of GAN is minimized with AMBO algorithm which outperforms other metaheuristic approaches in terms of convergence and solution. In AMBO, the function values are minimized to near optimal solution during early iterations. The proposed approach is analysed with abalone age dataset in which the classification related metrics are considered for performance evaluation. In addition to that, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, AUC, and G-mean performance obtained with the proposed approach is 95%, 96%, 98%, 0.92, and 0.9564 respectively. The numerical outcomes show that the model is best suited for real-time environment and outperforms the functionality of the existing systems.

PAH has been confirmed to have antibacterial and antifungal properties, but its antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities against Vibrio parahaemolyticus (V. parahaemolyticus) have not been reported. This work aimed to explore the antibacterial and antibiofilm efficacy of PAH against V. parahaemolyticus and its potential application in seafood. PAH showed moderate inhibitory effect against V. parahaemolyticus with minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) ranging from 20 to 40 mM. PAH destroyed cell membrane integrity and structure, as evidenced by the leakage of intracellular components and decreased cell viability. Meanwhile, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) indicated the involvement of oxidative stress in bactericidal mechanisms. PAH at subinhibitory concentrations (SICs) effectively reduced biofilm biomass as measured by crystal violet staining and plate colony counts assay. Furthermore, biofilm inhibitory effect of PAH on V. parahaemolyticus was also manifested by loose structure, decreased extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) contents of biofilm cells and less viable cells inside the biofilm. RT-qPCR showed that the expression of genes involved in biofilm was suppressed by PAH. Lastly, PAH (MIC and 2MIC) significantly decreased the level of V. parahaemolyticus in spiked abalone and shrimp samples without affecting sensory acceptability. These findings suggested that PAH might be potentially utilized individually or in combination with other preservation strategies to control V. parahaemolyticus infection and its biofilm in seafoods.",10.1016/j.foodcont.2024.110730,,0956-7135,1873-7129,,DEC,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2024.110730,

This study investigates the feasibility of green technology utilising food waste as a renewable substrate for lactic acid and the resulting residue for subsequent carbon dot production through microbial fermentation and hydrothermal reaction, respectively, while evaluating seashell waste as a replacement for commercial neutralisation reagents. The results demonstrated that seashell waste exhibited effective neutralisation performance during lactic acid fermentation. Within the five types of seashell waste studied, apart from abalone seashells, which led to a significant decrease in lactic acid productivity, all resulted in similar lactic acid fermentations. Additionally, fine powders of seashells were found to be optimal when combined with food waste hydrolysate for lactic acid fermentation. The highest lactic acid productivity of 1.48 g L-1 h-1 obtained in 2 L bioreactor batch fermentation using fine shell powder was 1.64-fold and 0.41-fold higher than those obtained using shell pieces and shell powder, respectively. The results of cell immobilisation fermentation exhibited a superior performance with 2.90 g L-1 h-1 glucose consumption rate and 1.89 g L-1 h-1 lactic acid productivity, which were 1.23-fold and 0.97-fold higher compared to those obtained using NaOH as the neutraliser, respectively.

Because seafood is a common source of arsenic exposure and some arsenolipids are toxic, studying the abundance and species of arsenolipids in seafood is crucial for health risk assessment. Current arsenolipid research is confined by analytical techniques and limited to raw seafood analysis, despite the fact that most seafood is ingested cooked. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate which seafood contributes to arsenolipid dietary intake and investigate the changes in arsenolipids before and after cooking. In Chongqing, China, popular seafood such as clam, shrimp, oyster, abalone, hairtail, and yellow croaker were collected. The raw and cooked samples prepared from these seafood products were examined using a non-targeted screening approach established for arsenolipids, which coupled high-performance liquid chromatography with data-independent high-resolution quadrupole-time-of-flight electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Arsenic-containing hydrocarbons (AsHC330, AsHC332, and AsHC360), arsenic-containing fatty acids (AsFA362, AsFA390, AsFA404, AsFA418, and AsFA422), trimethylarsine oxide, and thiolated trimethylarsinic acid were detected. The species of arsenolipids in each type of seafood remained intact after heating in the microwave oven. In cooked samples, the concentrations of AsFA362 and AsFA390 were significantly lower than in raw samples, whereas the concentrations of other arsenolipids were unchanged. Microwave cooking did not result in the thiolation of the detected arsenolipids. The most detected species in raw and cooked samples were AsFA362, AsFA390, and AsFA418. Most arsenolipid species were found in the highest levels in hairtails and yellow croakers. It is the first time that arsenolipids have been found in the oyster, abalone, abalone liver, and yellow croaker.

The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results showed that the Ca/P molar ratio of CHA was 1.72, which approaches the natural bone. The addition of paraffin wax in all concentration variation treatments caused the crystallographic properties of the CHA/paraffin wax nanocomposite scaffolds to decrease. The results of pore analysis suggest that the high concentration of paraffin wax in the CHA suspension is involved in the formation of more pores on the surface of the scaffold, but only CHA/paraffin wax 30 wt.% had a scaffold with potential to be used in media with a cellular growth orientation. The micropore analysis was also supported by the cell viability assay results for CHA/paraffin wax 30 wt.% nanocomposite scaffold, where serial doses of scaffold concentrations to mouse osteoblast cells were secure.

Of the major shellfish poisoning syndromes associated with HABs, Paralytic and Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP and DSP) pose the greatest concern, but as documented herein there are several other HAB organisms that are also present. Blooms of Alexandrium catenella have been recognised as the typical cause of PSP since 1948. In addition to the risk posed to human health A. catenella has also been the cause of large shellfish and bird mortalities. An additional risk of PSP is provided by Alexandrium minutum first detected in Cape Town harbour in 2003. DSP was identified on the South African coast for the first time in 1991. Although several Dinophysis spp. known to cause DSP have been recognized as a component of the plankton of the region, it is accepted that DSP is usually attributed to D. acuminata or D. fortii. In the southern Benguela both Pseudo-nitzschia australis and Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries have been identified and shown to produce domoic acid. Multiple Pseudo-nitzschia spp. have been identified in the northern Benguela with the potentially toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia pungens and P. australis dominant inshore. The yessotoxin (YTX) producing dinoflagellates Gonyaulax spinifera, Lingulodinium polyedrum and Protoceratium reticulatum are all known to form blooms and YTXs have been the cause of massive mortalities of farmed abalone. Prominent fish-killing blooms include Karlodinium veneficum in the northern Benguela and Karenia cristata in the southern Benguela. Shellfish farms in an embayment of the southern Benguela have suffered reduced growth rates due to the ecosystem disruptive blooms of Aureococcus anophagefferens.

Studies reveal that the complications associated with diabetes can be reduced by proper management of the disease by continuously monitoring and forecasting the blood glucose level of patients. Objective. The prior prediction of blood glucose level is necessary to overcome the lag time for insulin absorption in diabetic type 1 patients. Method. In this research, we use continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data to predict future blood glucose level using the previous data points. We compare two neural network techniques. We apply the optimal feedforward neural network and then propose optimal nonlinear autoregressive neural networks for blood glucose prediction 15-30 minutes earlier for diabetic type 1 patients. We validate the proposed model with 2 virtual subjects using their 24-hour blood glucose level data. These two case studies have been compiled from AIDA, i.e., the freeware mathematical diabetes simulator. Results. In the prediction horizon (PH) of 15 and 30 minutes, improved results have been shown for minimal inputs for blood glucose level of a particular subject. Root mean square error (RMSE) is used for performance calculation. For the optimal feedforward neural network, the RMSE is 0.9984 and 3.78 ml/dl, and for the optimal nonlinear autoregressive neural network, it reduces the RMSE to 0.60 and 1.12 ml/dl for 15 min and 30 min prediction horizons, respectively, for subject 1. Similarly, for subject 2 for the optimal feedforward neural network, RMSE is 1.43 and 3.51 ml/dl which is improved using the optimal autoregressive neural network to 0.7911 and 1.6756 ml/dl for 15 min and 30 min prediction horizons, respectively. Validation. We further validate our proposed model using UCI machine learning datasets (Abalone and Servo), and it shows improved results on that as well. Conclusion and Future Work.

The concentration of HCB porogen varied among 10, 20, 30, and 40 wt%. The Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis revealed that the Ca/P molar ratio of CHA was 1.73, which was close to natural bone's Ca/P molar ratio of 1.71. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD) tests revealed that the formed phase of the synthesized CHA was of the B-type. Analysis of the pores structure showed an increasing porogen concentration, pores size, and porosity of the scaffold. The addition of HCB porogen also decreased the crystallite size. This was very good for bone growth because the low crystallinity created dislocations, making it easier for cells to proliferate. Based on the results of cell viability assay on scaffold CHA + HCB 40 wt%, the growth of MC3T3E1 cells was inhibited beginning at a scaffold concentration of 500 mu g/mL because the percentage of viability decreased to similar to 115 % and the IC50 value of MC3T3E1 cells on the scaffold to 691830.97 mu g/mL. Based on to the one-way ANOVA, those result reflected no statistically significant differences in the average of cell viability value in the five groups (p > 0.05). The cell metabolic activity and morphology of the CHA + HCB 40 wt% scaffold enable it to facilitate the attachment of MC3T3E1 cells on its surface.

In this study, the effect of sulfated polysaccharides from pacific abalone (AGSP) on the human gut microbiota was analyzed via an in vitro fermentation model. The results revealed that AGSP altered the overall structure of the gut microbiota and increased relative abundances of some Bacteroidales members, implying that intestinal Bacteroidales can play important roles in the bioactivities of AGSP. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, some species from the Bacteroides and Parabacteroides within Bacteroidales were isolated, and their characteristics on AGSP utilization were analyzed. It showed that AGSP utilization by intestinal Bacteroidales was species-dependent, and some species that liberated AGSP breakdown products promoted the growth of others unable to live in AGSP, forming an AGSP utilization network. The in vitro cell model showed that AGSP oligosaccharides had better anti-inflammatory activity and weaker cytotoxicity, implying that microbial degradation of AGSP can influence its reaction with host cells.

Notwithstanding the upturn, their conventional synthesis at extremely high temperatures yielding limiting compositions stands in the way of achieving a paradigm shift in gCN fabrication. With the ultimate goal of surpassing these hurdles, we utilize N-doped carbon nanosheets (N-CNS) as a filler in free-radical-mediated aqueous copolymerization. By dispersing N-CNS in a polymer matrix, high-performance mechanically robust composites could be developed and tailored to individual applications. As-synthesized hydrogel nanocomposite systems are used to decode the balance for emulating evolutionary accomplishments of nature's nanocomposites like the abalone's nacre. At a lower concentration (0.05%), N-CNS disperse homogeneously and interact intimately with the polymer matrix forming an interphase zone around individual nanofillers dramatically affecting the mobility of polymer chains to yield sheet architectures. On increasing the filler concentration (0.3%), the intercalation phenomenon gets perturbed due to an intrinsically oriented aggregation of nanofiller giving rise to a surge in entropy that leads to conspicuous buckling and tubular aggregates. At the interfacial regime, the poly(acrylic acid) domains come in closer proximity to the hydrophobic cages of N-CNS, and a nanoconfinement effect exerts high pressure manifesting acid-catalyzed condensation of melamine units to form, for the first time, quasi-two-dimensional heptazine-gCN (h-gCN) within hydrogel nanocomposites. Polymer properties are enhanced by the addition of N-CNS through complex interfacial interactions and the unique distributions of internanofiller distances.

A urease-producing bacterial isolate AX5, identified as Citrobacter braakii, from calcite rich shells of abalone that could tolerate cadmium at the concentration of 250 mg/l was used. In order to investigate the role of MICP in enhancing the synthesis of CdS nanoparticles, the biomimetic synthesis was carried out by C. braakii in modified nutrient broth without amending any additional organic or toxic surfactants back into the environment. The large amount of monodispersed CdS nanoparticles was harvested and found to bind with biocalcite. XRD analysis confirmed the presence of CdS nanoparticles bound with biocalcite minerals in the precipitation. HRTEM and SEM micrographs showed spherical CdS nanoparticles of particle size in the range of 50-100 nm. The other characteristics of harvested CcIS nanoparticles were studied with UV-vis, PL spectra, FUR, and fluorescence microscopy. The findings of present study have important insights into the application of MICP as a promising mechanism for the biosynthesis of CcIS nanoparticles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This is certainly true for the mollusk shell, where glycosylated intracrystalline proteins such as AP24 (Haliotis rufescens) exist but their functions and the role of glycosylation remain elusive. To assess the effect of glycosylation on protein function, we expressed two recombinant variants of AP24: an unglycosylated bacteria expressed version (rAP24N) and a glycosylated insect cell-expressed version (rAP24G). Our findings indicate that rAP24G is expressed as a single polypeptide containing variations in glycosylation that create microheterogeneity in rAP24G molecular masses. These post-translational modifications incorporate O- and N-glycans and anionic monosialylated and bisialylated, and monosulfated and bisulfated monosaccharides on the protein molecules. AFM and DLS experiments confirm that both rAP24N and rAP24G aggregate to form protein phases, with rAP24N exhibiting a higher degree of aggregation, compared to rAP24G. With regard to functionality, we observe that both recombinant proteins exhibit similar behavior within in vitro calcium carbonate mineralization assays and potentiometric titrations. However, rAP24G modifies crystal growth directions and is a stronger nucleation inhibitor, whereas rAP24N exhibits higher mineral phase stabilization and nanoparticle containment. We believe that the post-translational addition of anionic groups (via sialylation and sulfation), along with modifications to the protein surface topology, may explain the changes in glycosylated rAP24G aggregation and mineralization behavior, relative to rAP24N.",10.1021/acs.biochem.5b01186,"Rao, Ashit/0000-0002-5440-8007",0006-2960,,,Feb-23,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.5b01186,26784838

A shell color segregation study with progenies from a full factorial cross generated among Pacific oysters exhibiting distinct shell colors (golden, white and black) was conducted to investigate the inheritance of the golden shell color and its correlation with dark pigmentation. Random samples from twenty-three full-sib families were obtained and the shell coloration of offspring within each family was recorded. Results revealed that golden coloration was inherited in a different pattern from dark pigmentation, indicating its different genetic basis. Dark pigmentation was identified as a foreground color while golden or white color were background ones. The locus controlling background colors has two alleles with the allele for golden background being dominant to the allele for white background. In addition, the overlying foreground pigmentation of shells with a golden background was significantly lighter than that of shells with a white background, which suggested an epistatic effect of background color on shell foreground pigmentation. All these findings will facilitate the selection of elite oyster lines with desired shell coloration for aquaculture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

LbAly35 showed practically no similarity to other molluscan alginate lyases in the N-terminal amino-acid sequence of 20 residues and no cross-reactivity with anti-abalone alginate lyase antiserum. These led us to consider that the primary structure of LbAly35 is considerably deviated from other molluscan enzymes. Thus, in the present study, we first compared the thermal stability of LbAly35 with an abalone alginate lyase, HdAly, and found that the first order inactivation rate constants for LbAly35 at 40 and 45 A degrees C were 1/20 and 1/45 of those for HdAly, respectively. Then, we cloned cDNAs encoding LbAly35 and characterized its deduced amino-acid sequence comparing with those of other molluscan alginate lyases. The cDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 5'- and 3'-RACE PCRs from the L. brevicula hepatopancreas cDNA using degenerated primers synthesized on the basis of partial amino-acid sequences of LbAly35. The cDNA covering the entire translational region of LbAly35 comprised 1,093 bp and encoded an amino-acid sequence of 296 residues. The amino-acid sequence consisted of an initiation methionine, a putative signal peptide for secretion (22 residues), a propeptide-like region (10 residues), and a mature LbAly35 domain of 263 residues. Although the N-terminal region of LbAly35 was significantly deviated from those of other molluscan alginate lyases, the catalytic domain of LbAly35 showed similar to 45 % identity to other molluscan enzymes which had been classified under polysaccharide-lyase-family-14 (PL-14). In addition, the amino-acid residues crucially important for the catalytic actions of PL-14 enzymes were also conserved in LbAly35. Accordingly, LbAly35 was regarded as a member of PL-14 as other molluscan alginate lyases despite the significant deviation of its N-terminal region.",10.1007/s12562-012-0517-1,,0919-9268,,,JUL,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-012-0517-1,

Research has shown that their emergent mechanical properties are owed in part to their specific self-organization in hierarchical molecular structures, from nanoscale to macroscale, as well as their mixing and bonding. To apply these findings to manmade materials, researchers have devoted significant efforts in developing a fundamental understanding of multiscale mechanics of materials and its application to the design of novel materials with superior mechanical performance. These efforts included the utilization of some of the most promising carbon-based nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, and graphene, together with a variety of matrix materials. At the core of these efforts lies the need to characterize material mechanical behavior across multiple length scales starting from nanoscale characterization of constituents and their interactions to emerging micro- and macroscale properties. In this report, progress made in experimental tools and methods currently used for material characterization across multiple length scales is reviewed, as well as a discussion of how they have impacted our current understanding of the mechanics of hierarchical carbon-based materials. In addition, insight is provided into strategies for bridging experiments across length scales, which are essential in establishing a multiscale characterization approach.

In addition, they are present in numerous invertebrates, from cnidarians to urochordates. Many of those from non-mammalian groups are poorly understood with respect to function or phylogeny. Those well characterized so far are waprins from snakes, perlwapins from bivalves and crustins from decapod crustaceans. Waprins are venom proteins with a single WAP domain at the C-terminus. They display antimicrobial, rather than proteinase inhibitory, activities. Perlwapins, in contrast, possess three WAP domains at the C-terminus and are expressed in the shell nacre of abalones. They participate in shell formation by inhibiting the growth of calcium crystals in the shell. The crustin group is the largest of all WFDC-containing proteins in invertebrates with the vast majority being highly expressed in the haemocytes. Most have a single WAP domain at the C-terminus. The presence and type of the domains between the signal sequence and the C-terminus WAP domain separate the different crustin types. Most of the Type I and II crustins are antimicrobial towards Gram-positive bacteria, whereas the Type III crustins tend to display protease inhibition. Expression studies show that at least some crustins have other important biological effects, as levels change with physiological stress, wound repair, tissue regeneration or ecdysis. Thus WAP domains are widely distributed and highly conserved, serving in diverse physiological processes (proteinase inhibition, bacterial killing or inhibition of calcium transport).",10.1042/BST0391403,,0300-5127,1470-8752,,OCT,http://dx.doi.org/10.1042/BST0391403,21936823

This is achieved by producing siderophores that bind the iron which is later liberated internally in the cell. Under conditions of iron limitation, siderophore producing bacteria have therefore an antagonistic growth advantage over other species. This has been observed in particular in agricultural and aquacultural systems, as well as in food microbiology. We investigate here the possibility of a probiotic biocontrol strategy to eradicate a well established, often pathogenic, non-chelating population by supplementing the system with generally regarded as safe siderophore producing bacteria.

We report here novel findings which implicate AP7 as a member of the intrinsically disordered protein class (IDP) and reveal new aspects of AP7 mineralization activity. AP7 is partially disordered but can undergo additional folding in the presence of TFE. AP7 binds Zn(II) ions in a non-tetracoordinate complex but does not require Zn(II) either for folding or for in vitro function. In addition to limiting calcite crystal growth, AP7 is also observed to induce aggregate formation within in vitro mineralization assays, and these aggregates are either amorphous (type A) or crystalline (type B) in appearance. The type A aggregate displays an irregular morphology and round, dark, electron dense deposits that do not give rise to a diffraction pattern. In contrast, the type B aggregates possess either organized parallel crystal clusters or highly dense hexagonal clusters that are confirmed by electron diffraction to be aragonite. This stabilization of aragonite is remarkable in that it occurred in the presence of AP7 alone and did not require typical aragonite stabilization agents such as Mg(II), other nacre proteins, or an organized organic matrix. The ability of a partially disordered C-RING protein to perform inorganic phase stabilization represents a new twist on both the RING domain and IDP stories, and this process of aggregate formation may provide an important clue with regard to the protein-mediated nacre formation process.",10.1021/bi802148r,,0006-2960,,,Feb-17,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi802148r,19159266

The representative eight species, chum salmon, scallop, red sea bream, flounder, kuruma prawn, swimming crab, abalone and sea urchin, are investigated. It has been proven for chum salmon, scallop and red sea bream that stock enhancement contributes to the augmentation of net fishery production with economic feasibility. However, marked variations between prefectures in the scale of release were observed, and large variations in their stocking effectiveness were suggested in the six of the eight species (apart from chum salmon and scallop). There are two basic measures for evaluating stocking effectiveness. One is a direct measure of total returns and the other is the post-release survival rate. To estimate total returns, sample surveys of commercial landings in fish markets have generally been used in Japan, and a general estimating method of effectiveness from a two-stage sample survey has been developed. Methods for estimating post-release mortality rates based on lag recoveries have also been developed for the problems of over dispersion and correlation caused by the aggregation and mixture of released individuals. Key factors for success, the impact of stocking on fisheries management and wild stocks are also discussed. The present challenge is how to use stock enhancement for sustainable fishery production in addition to the proper management of the wild stock. Scientific evaluation of stocking effectiveness and responsible use of hatchery enhancement are the key points in the coming phase of stock enhancement.",,,,,0-85238-246-4,,,

Patterns and mechanisms observed over 25 years in a large kelp forest suggest that definition of a meaningful benchmark is impossible, because many of the large animals have been gone for years to decades, and kelps are sensitive to large-scale, low-frequency El Nino-Southern Oscillation events and longer term regime shifts. A shift in the oceanographic climate has significantly reduced the average size and carrying capacity of the dominant plant. The animals that have been functionally removed from the community include sea otters, black sea bass, yellowtail, white sea bass, and abalones. Other species are still present, but fisheries have had huge effects on the abundances, size-frequencies, and/or spatial distributions of sheephead, kelp bass, rays, flatfish, rock fish, spiny lobsters, and red sea urchins. Now even sea cucumbers, crabs, and small snails are subject to unregulated fishing. The plants continue to exist without a hint of the effects of the loss of so much animal biomass. Furthermore, most of the megafauna have been removed with very little documentation or historical understanding of what the natural community was like. Thus, our ability to separate anthropogenic impacts from the natural dynamics of the system is severely compromised.

Outbreaks connected with fish vectors were caused by scombroid, ciguatoxin, bacteria and unknown agents; in shellfish, unknown agents, paralytic shellfish poisoning, Vibrio spp. and other bacteria, followed by hepatitis A virus, were responsible for the outbreaks. At least ten genera of bacterial pathogens have been implicated in seafood-borne diseases. Over the past twenty-five years, bacterial pathogens associated with faecal contamination have represented only 4% of the shellfish-associated outbreaks, while naturally-occurring bacteria accounted for 20% of shellfish-related illnesses and 99% of the deaths. Most of these indigenous bacteria fall into the family Vibrionaceae which includes the genera Vibrio, Aeromonas and Plesiomonas. In general, Vibrio spp, are not associated with faecal contamination and therefore faecal indicators do not correlate with the presence of Vibrio. Viruses are the most significant cause of shellfish-associated disease: in New York State, for example, 33% and 62% of 196 outbreaks between 1981 and 1992 were caused by Norwalk virus and gastrointestinal viruses (small round structured viruses), respectively. In addition, several illnesses are a result of toxic algal blooms, the growth of naturally occurring bacteria and diatoms causing neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning, diarrhoetic shellfish poisoning, amnesic shellfish poisoning and ciguatera. Current estimates place the annual number of ciguatera cases at 20,000 world-wide. Scombroid poisoning is the most significant cause of illness associated with seafood. Scombrotoxin is of bacterial origin and halophilic Vibrio spp. causing high histamine levels are implicated as the source. Scombroid poisoning is geographically diverse and many species have been implicated, namely: tuna, mahi-mahi, bluefish, sardines, mackerel, amberjack and abalone. Temperature abuse has been cited as a major cause of scombroid poisoning. For routine work, the use of faecal indicators to predict the relative level of faecal contamination should not be disposed of. However, the main source of seafood illness is due to species which are not predicted by these organisms. In order to protect public health, routine surveillance using new pathogen-specific techniques such as polymerase chain reaction should be used.

Fusion products between wild (brown color) and mutant (green color) type protoplasts and between pairs of protoplasts of wild type were visually identified and used to determine the fusion efficiency. Cell wall digestions were carried out in solutions consisting of two kinds of enzymes. One was derived from the marine bacterium Pseudomonas sp. and the other was from one of the following sources: abalones Natohaliotis discus (AAP), top shells Turbo cornutus (TSAP), sea hares Aplysia kurodai (SHAP) or sea urchins Anthocidaris crassispine (SUAP). Both AAP and TSAP, either one combined with bacterial crude enzymes, showed approximately similar effects on the protoplast fusion. Under these enzyme treatments, a maximum of 15 to 20% of the isolated protoplasts formed hybrids after exposure to electric pulses. However, their fusion activities were quite unstable and the fusion rates declined immediately. Thus, fusion rates were only a few percent even when protoplast isolation reached maximum. In the case of the combined SUAP and bacterial enzymes, optimal fusion rate of protoplasts also was observed at approximately 20% but protoplasts could form hybrids with relatively high rates (more than 10%) for at least 2 h during enzyme treatment. Conversely, little or no fusion product was obtained from the protoplasts prepared with the combined SHAP and bacterial enzyme or with the combination of partially purified enzyme from abalone and bacterial, although protoplast production was effective in these solutions. Consequently, the combination of SUAP and bacterial crude enzyme was the most efficient enzyme system for protoplast electrofusion among all the systems examined. In addition, study of the survival rates of the algal protoplasts suggested that the electrofusion efficiency would be largely influenced by the viability of protoplasts during treatment with the wall-lytic enzymes.",10.1016/0044-8486(92)90106-U,,0044-8486,,,DEC,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0044-8486(92)90106-U,

However, the threat has not been estimated for the coming decades in a form that meets the needs of these industries. Tasmanian fisheries and aquaculture in southeast Australia have been severely impacted by marine heatwaves in recent years, especially the oyster, abalone, and salmon industries. In a series of semi-structured interviews with key Tasmanian fishery and aquaculture stakeholders, information was gathered about the following: (i) the impacts they have experienced to date from marine heatwaves, (ii) their planning for future marine heatwaves, and (iii) the information that would be most useful to aid planning. Using CMIP6 historical and future simulations of sea surface temperatures around Tasmania, we developed a marine heatwave hazard index guided by these stakeholder conversations. The region experienced a severe marine heatwave during the austral summer of 2015/16, which has been used here as a reference point to define the index. Our marine heatwave hazard index shows that conditions like those experienced in 2015/16 are projected to occur approximately 1-in-5 years by the 2050s under a low emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) or 1-in-2 years under a high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5). Increased frequency of marine heatwaves will likely reduce productivity by both direct (mortality) and in-direct (ecosystem change, greater incidence of disease) impacts on target species. The illustrative hazard index is one step towards a marine heatwave risk index, which would also need to consider aspects of exposure and vulnerability to be of greater utility to stakeholders.",10.1007/s10584-024-03684-8,"Kajtar, Jules/0000-0003-0114-6610; Hobday, Alistair/0000-0002-3194-8326; Ugalde, Sarah/0000-0003-2260-334X; Mundy, Craig/0000-0002-1945-3750; Holbrook, Neil/0000-0002-3523-6254",0165-0009,1573-1480,,FEB,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-024-03684-8,

Although the heritability of shell color variation has been conducted by experimental crossing, little is known about molecular basis involved in these patterns. Tyrosinase-like proteins are important enzymes which are members of the type-3 copper protein superfamily. In this research, two tyrosinase-like protein genes including CgTyp-1 and CgTyp-3 were identified in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Tissue expression analysis showed that CgTyp-1 and CgTyp-3 were dominantly expressed in the mantle. Particularly, they were expressed significantly higher in the edge mantle than that in the central mantle whether on the left or right mantles. Additionally, expressions of CgTyp-1 and CgTyp-3 were mainly found in the black shell color oysters, with relative lower levels in the white shell color oysters. In situ hybridization showed that positive signals for CgTyp-1 and CgTyp-3 were both detected within the outer epithelium of the outer fold either in the black or white shell color oysters. After interference, the expression levels of CgTyp-1 and CgTyp-3 mRNA were significantly attenuated, and the efficiency of RNAi reached 84.72% and 71.58%, respectively. Besides, knockdown CgTyp-1 or CgTyp-3, obviously decreased the tyrosinase activity of mantles. Furthermore, the number of the melanosomes within epithelium of the outer fold was sharply reduced by silencing of each Typ. These findings argue that CgTyp-1 and CgTyp-3 may be involved in the melanin synthesis, which lends insight into regulation mechanism of shell pigmentation in C. gigas.",10.1016/j.gene.2022.146742,"Liu, Shikai/0000-0001-5777-489X; Kong, Lingfeng/0000-0001-5263-1697",0378-1119,1879-0038,,Oct-05,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2022.146742,35868415

A new species, Anoplodiscus hutsonae n. sp. is proposed for museum specimens originally collected from species of Scolopsis Cuvier (Nemipteridae) off Heron Island and Lizard Island, Australia. Additionally, Anoplodiscus tai Ogawa, 1994 is synonymised with Anoplodiscus cirrusspiralis Roubal, Armitage & Rohde, 1983 due to a lack of support for differential characters, and Anoplodiscus richiardii is considered a species inquirenda. Anoplodiscus cirrusspiralis causes visible lesions on the skin and fins of its host, and may also contribute to poor food conversion rates in sparid aquaculture. Anoplodiscus cirrusspiralis has been recorded from cultured sparids in Australia, Japan, South Africa, and South Korea, and was implicated as a disease agent in fish from the former two countries. However, the discovery of A. cirrusspiralis on Chrysoblephus gibbiceps (Valenciennes), Ch. laticeps (Valenciennes) and Cymatoceps nasutus (Castelnau) in South Africa, ?Pagrus major (Temminck & Schlegel) in South Korea, and P. auratus (Forster) in Australia, New Zealand and Japan suggests that this species may have a wide distribution and low host-specificity within the Sparidae. In South Africa, A. cirrusspiralis was first encountered on a morbid C. nasutus and Ch. gibbiceps from two public aquaria in 2009 (Two Oceans Aquarium, Cape Town and uShaka Sea World, Durban, respectively).

These data sources include tagging data to inform growth. Diagnostic statistics and plots have been developed to explore how well integrated population models fit the data types typically used for assessment purposes (index data, size- and age-compositions, and conditional age-at-length data). However, such statistics and plots are not available for tagging data, when these data are used to estimate growth. This paper outlines two diagnostic statistics that can be used to evaluate fits to tagging data, and develops a method based on 'Francis weighting' for weighting tagging data in integrated models. For illustration, the methods are applied to Aleutian Islands golden king crab (Lithodes aequispinus) in Alaska, and tiger prawns (Penaeus semisulcatus and P. esculentus) in Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery. Some degree of growth model mis-specification was revealed for P. semisulcatus, and there were conflicts in the data for the tiger prawns. The standard errors for the estimates of mature male biomass for golden king crab were larger when the tagging data were downweighted based on the proposed weighting method. This serves to emphasise that assessments and their interpretations can be impacted by how tagging data are weighted. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The phospho-metabolite profile of a living organism is often indicative of imbalances that may have been caused by environmental stressors, such as surfactants. This study utilizes in vivo P-31 NMR to monitor temporal changes in the phospho-metabolite profile of Artemia caused by Tx-100, CPC, and SDS and the ability of humic acid (HA) to mitigate the toxicity of these surfactants. It was found that, while Tx-100 does not have any effect on the phospho-metabolite profile, both CPC and SDS cause a complete retardation in growth of the phosphodiester (PDE) peak in the P-31 NMR spectrum, which is indicative of the inhibited cell replication. This growth inhibition was independently verified by the decreased guanosine triphosphate (GTP) concentration in the CPC and SDS-exposed Artemia. In addition, upon introduction of HA to the CPC and SDS-exposed Artemia, an increase of PDE peak over time is indicative of HA mitigating toxicity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the southern Benguela, most of South Africa's commercial fisheries have a long history of exploitation and this, coupled with spatio-temporal changes in key species over the last three decades has severely impacted some of South Africa's fisheries and ecosystems. This review summarizes these spatio-temporal changes and investigates possible drivers thereof. It incorporates both past and current research, with a large portion of the latter having formed part of the University of Cape Town's Ma-Re BASICS (Marine Research in the Benguela and Agulhas Systems for supporting Interdisciplinary Climate-change Science) 2010-2013 program. Almost all described changes involve a temporal decline or a spatial shift in species. Fishing seems to have played a role in many of the observed stock declines, for example through geographically disproportionate catches in relation to stock distribution. In some cases, changes in the physical environment seem to have played an additional role, e.g., rock lobsters on the west coast have been affected by fishing as well as changes in the physical environment. In almost all cases these changes have taken place since the 1980s/1990s, except for one or two resources, which have experienced declines since at least the mid 20th century. Spatial shifts in species have either involved an eastward expansion of cool-water species, including kelps, rock lobster and pelagic fish, or a retraction of warm-water species such as the brown mussel, suggesting a cooling of inshore waters along the south-west coast since the 1980s. This suggested cooling is revealed in ocean temperature (SST Pathfinder), wind and upwelling data for the Cape Peninsula and south-west coast region during the same period. The absence or inconsistency of long-term data is problematic when trying to identify drivers of ecosystem change, and actual ecosystem change itself. We discuss this using ocean temperature in the southern Benguela as an example. In addition, the complex interplay between climate and anthropogenic (notably fishing) drivers makes identification of drivers difficult and disentangling these combined effects will require interdisciplinary collaboration, co-ordinated ecosystem projects, increased modelling effort and the continuation, but also establishment, of new, long-term monitoring studies.

Aquaculture of the species exists in close proximity to native populations, but very little is known about the health of native populations. Baseline information on endosymbiont identification, prevalence, intensity, and geographic distribution are necessary to facilitate management and/or mitigation of potential disease interactions between cultured and natural shellfish stocks. A survey of Pacific geoduck (P. generosa) parasites from three natural populations in Washington state (Totten Inlet, Thorndyke Bay, Freshwater Bay) was conducted in 2008 to 2010. Histopathology of 634 animals was used to explore trends of parasite presence and to identify potential environmental factors (site distribution, collection depth, and season) that influence parasite assemblages. Endosymbionts observed on histological examination included Rickettsia-like organisms (RLOs) in the ctenidia (n = 246); an unidentified metazoan parasite in the siphon epithelium (n = 220); and microsporidia-like species in the intestine (n = 103), siphonmuscle (n = 28), and ova (a Steinhausia-like parasite; n = 99). This study reveals the presence of three microsporidia-like organisms (including Steinhausia-like parasites) not previously described in geoducks. Assemblages of most parasites showed strong seasonal variations and site-specific distributions throughout the year. The presence of Rickettsia-like organisms may be driven by seasonal elevated temperatures, and was extremely common at Freshwater Bay. Metazoans and microsporidia were common in South Puget Sound and exhibited high infection intensity year-round. Spawning season drove Steinhausia-like parasite presence with no spatial driver.

The South African coastline comprises several distinct coastal ecoregions that support a wide range of coastal (inshore) ecosystems, including rocky, sandy and mixed shores, kelp beds, estuaries and seagrass communities. A growing body of evidence indicates that local air and sea temperatures, wind patterns, ocean current speed and upwelling regimes are all being affected by human-mediated climate change. In addition, anthropogenic activities, such as shipping (introducing coastal bioinvasives), exploitation of coastal marine resources, industry (releasing pollutants) and urban development, act synergistically with climate change to place pressure on coastal ecosystems and their biota. The aim of this review was primarily to synthesise and update research into causes of direct and indirect human-mediated global change and their effects on South African coastal systems. It incorporates both historic and the latest regional research on climate change and anthropogenic threats across the ecosystems listed above, much of which was supported by the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research (SANCOR), specifically the SEAChange programme in recent years. It is evident that all these ecosystems are vulnerable to all the drivers considered, albeit to differing degrees, depending on their location on the coast. Whereas some bioinvasives have had a dramatic impact on rocky shore systems on the West Coast, their impact has been moderate on the South Coast and minimal on the East Coast; exploitation shows the reverse pattern. Furthermore, the impacts of human-mediated drivers on coastal ecosystems are synergistic. Of major interest is the fact that the West Coast and parts of the South Coast are exhibiting cooling trends in offshore sea surface temperatures, rather than warming. Correspondingly, a geographical spread of organisms associated with West and South-West Coast rocky shores and kelp beds has tended to be eastwards around Cape Point, rather than northwards along the West Coast as would have been expected with warming sea temperatures.

The commercially-important West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii is one of these, and its shift in distribution has had profound effects on the rest of the ecosystem along the south-west coast. Reasons for these shifts are not fully understood, but are probably linked to changes in environmental conditions. We applied a sequential t-test algorithm for analyzing regime shifts (STARS) to physical (wind and upwelling) and biological (rock-lobster catch and growth, Bank Cormorant abundance) data for the southern Benguela inshore region and performed sensitivity tests on each of the variables. Regime shifts were defined as 'robust' or 'possible' if they were detected for >= 70% or >= 60% of the sensitivity tests respectively. To corroborate the shifts detected by STARS, we then applied two additional methods: change point analysis and the Chow breakpoint test. The STARS method outperformed the other two methods because it could handle shorter time series and detect shifts towards the end of the time series, but most of the significant shifts detected by STARS were also detected by one or both of the other methods. A significant shift in Cape Point winter winds occurred in 1983, an El Nino year. However, measurement methodology changed during the same period and this is discussed in relation to the shift. A decline in rock-lobster growth rate occurred in the mid 1980s, and significant increases in upwelling variability and mean summer winds were detected in the early-to-mid 1990s - the same period in which rock lobster abundance underwent an eastward shift, declining on the west coast and increasing on the southwest coast. Bank Cormorants underwent respective declines and increases in the mid-to-late 1990s on the west and south-west coasts following the shift in lobsters. Further shifts in mean wind and upwelling were detected in the 2000s. These results are a step towards developing ecosystem indicators for the region, which can be monitored with the intended use of providing an early warning system for long-term, ecosystem-scale changes.

Cytopathological and histopathological features of the clam infected by MM5 were carried out by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, respectively. Cytopathologically, foci of MM5 were found in hepatocytes of the clam infected by MM5. In addition, cytopathological lesion was detected in foot of infected clam. Histopathologically, MM5 was detected in different tissues of infected clam, including hepatopancreas, mantle and gill. Challenge test combined with pathological features indicated that MM5 was virulent to M. meretrix. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Five of the six species (collected at Wreck Rock, Western Australia in 1985) exhibited a high turnover of phosphorus (P) relative to nitrogen (N). In contrast to N, P turnover was related to the concentration of P in body tissues. A relatively high demand for P in the diet is required to support the observed rapid turnover of P with respect to N.

The high respiration rate of newly released larvae (mean=306.3 pmol O-2 larva(-1) h(-1), range=149.3 to 466.6, n=18 trials, 22.5 degrees C) from adults collected at Link Port, Fort Pierce, Florida during the winter/spring of 1990-1991 reflects their active swimming behavior. The average energy content per larva was 15.24 mJ (range: 13.35 to 20.17 mJ ind(-1), n=5 groups). If all cells have an identical energy content and metabolic rate, then 2 and 20% of the total energy content would be consumed by the onset (2 h post-release) and the loss (24 h post-release) of metamorphic competence. Larvae of B. neritina are a composite of both larval and juvenile tissues and the loss of metamorphic competence may be due to regional depletion of labile energy stores in transitory ''larval'' cells, particularly the ciliated cells that comprise the locomotory organ, the corona. Although ''nonfeeding'', B. neritina larvae can acquire nutrients from the environment in the form of dissolved organic materials (DOM) in seawater. Both the amino acid alanine and the fatty acid palmitic acid can be transported from seawater ([S]=1 mu M, 22.5 degrees C). The rates of alanine influx (appearance of label in tissue) averaged 0.366 pmol larva(-1) h(-1) and, based on comparisons between rates of solute transport and metabolism, would contribute little (<1% of required energy) to offset the metabolic demand. The average rate of palmitic acid influx was 4.668 pmol larva(-1) h-l and, assuming that the measured influx equals the net solute flux, could account for 21 to 72% of energy requirements. These data suggest that the duration of planktonic life of B. neritina larvae is principally regulated by the amount of endogenous energy stores, but may be modulated by available DOM in seawater.",10.1007/BF00354313,,0025-3162,,,JUL,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00354313,

In this case, almost all cells died through necrosis or apoptosis, which appeared to increase in mussel cell cultures after a freeze-thaw cycle. Apoptosis was not a main death pathway in mussel cells, but it was induced in a significant part of these cells (up to 24%) immediately after thawing and depended mostly on the cryoprotectant used.

By integrating enhanced random feature mapping and dynamic pseudo-input selection, MSGP achieves significantly improved computational efficiency while maintaining competitive predictive performance. Although some combinations of feature mapping and pseudo-input selection may show reduced accuracy in specific datasets, MSGP generally outperforms standard GPR on benchmark datasets. For example, on the Winequality-red dataset, MSGP-C reduces computation time to 0.61 s versus GPR's 14.45 s, with comparable accuracy (88.92% versus 90.26%). On the high-dimensional Online News Popularity dataset, MSGP achieves improved accuracy as dimensionality increases. MSGP also demonstrates stable computation times and improved error metrics as volume grows in the Bike Sharing dataset. Robustness tests show MSGP performs reliably in noisy environments (e.g. 94.17% accuracy on noisy Abalone data in 2.91 s versus GPR's 138.32 s). However, in certain complex datasets, such as Abalone with static pseudo-input selection, MSGP may show lower accuracy.

The type of relationship between the RLOs and the pleasure oyster is largely unknown and further investigations are needed to determine if these bacteria warrant management concern in C. corteziensis . In this study, the morphological characteristics of the RLOs were studied by histology and SEM, and the taxonomic affiliations of the bacteria were evaluated by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. In addition, the prevalence and intensity of the RLOs was recorded from 2007 to 2017 by histology. The RLOs were observed inside circular basophilic cytoplasmic membrane bound vacuoles (MBVs) that had an average length and width of 15.70 +/- 15.24 mu m and 15.42 +/- 14.95 mu m respectively. Apart from cellular hypertrophy, no tissue alterations were observed in the areas adjacent to the RLOs. Individual bacteria within the MBVs were coccoid in shape with an average length of 0.65 +/- 0.12 mu m and an average width of 0.38 +/- 0.09 mu m. The bacterial microbiota of a selected number of samples (one sample without RLOs and two samples with RLOs) showed the presence of intracellular parasite OTUs corresponding to the families Rickettsiaceae and Anaplasmataceae, suggesting that the RLOs from the pleasure oyster is associated with the order Rickettsiales . A mean prevalence of 5 % was observed throughout the study period and the majority of the organisms (89 %) presented low intensity of Grade 1 (30 -61 RLOs) of the MBVs.

Land-based aquaculture of red seaweed typically employ tumble culture systems, where compressed air is delivered to the bottom of the tank to provide gas exchange and promote mixing. However, aeration is a potentially costly process because compressed air must be bubbled into the liquid, and power is required to drive the air compressor. In this study, fundamental relationships between aeration rate, biomass productivity, and aeration power consumption were developed for tumble tank cultivation of the red seaweed Pacific dulse under CO2-replete growth conditions. The biomass productivity (g biomass L-1 d-1) of D. mollis in tumble culture was measured over seven weekly harvest cycles over a range of aeration rates (0.086-0.684 L air L-1 liquid min-1) for fine-bubble (1-5 mm) and coarse-bubble (2-3 cm) aerators, and then correlated to the CO2 transfer rate (CO2-TR, mmol CO2 L-1 h-1). The CO2-TR consolidated aeration rate, CO2 partial pressure, boundary layer diffusion, and gas sparger characteristics (bubble size, interfacial area) into a single parameter. This analysis required measurements of the gas-to-liquid mass transfer coefficient (kLa) for estimation of CO2-TR, and pressure drop across the gas diffuser for aeration power consumption. CO2-replete biomass productivity required a CO2-TR that was three times the CO2 demand. For fine-bubble aeration, both CO2-TR and aeration power consumption were higher than for coarse-bubble aeration over the range of aeration rates tested. However, when the aeration rate needed to achieve CO2-replete biomass productivity was approached, fine-bubble aeration required less energy consumption due to lower aeration requirement. The optimum was achieved at an aeration rate of 0.26 L air L-1 culture min-1 using fine-bubble aeration, which provided an areal biomass productivity of 490 g FW m- 2 d-1 (fresh mass) or 32 g AFDW m- 2 d-1 (ash-free dry mass), at an aeration energy power requirement of 1.5 kWh/kg FW (22 kWh/kg AFDW). Overall, this study showed that aeration systems can easily limit biomass productivity and result in high aeration energy consumption per kg of biomass produced if the aeration processes are not thoughtfully considered. The key tradeoff was that aeration energy consumption increased significantly as CO2-replete biomass productivity was approached. Therefore, optimization would require the use of an aerator system that provides the best possible kLa and lowest pressure drop at the lowest possible aeration rate.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.740638,,0044-8486,1873-5622,,Apr-15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.740638,

"Hernroth, BE; Baden, SP",Alteration of host-pathogen interactions in the wake of climate change - Increasing risk for shellfish associated infections?,2018,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,161,,425,438,,"The potential for climate-related spread of infectious diseases through marine systems has been highlighted in several reports. With this review we want to draw attention to less recognized mechanisms behind vector-borne transmission pathways to humans. We have focused on how the immune systems of edible marine shellfish, the blue mussels and Norway lobsters, are affected by climate related environmental stressors. Future ocean acidification (OA) and warming due to climate change constitute a gradually increasing persistent stress with negative trade-off for many organisms. In addition, the stress of recurrent hypoxia, inducing high levels of bioavailable manganese (Mn) is likely to increase in line with climate change. We summarized that OA, hypoxia and elevated levels of Mn did have an overall negative effect on immunity, in some cases also with synergistic effects. On the other hand, moderate increase in temperature seems to have a stimulating effect on antimicrobial activity and may in a future warming scenario counteract the negative effects. However, rising sea surface temperature and climate events causing high land run-off promote the abundance of naturally occurring pathogenic Vibrio and will in addition, bring enteric pathogens which are circulating in society into coastal waters. Moreover, the observed impairments of the immune defense enhance the persistence and occurrence of pathogens in shellfish. This may increase the risk for direct transmission of pathogens to consumers. It is thus essential that in the wake of climate change, sanitary control of coastal waters and seafood must recognize and adapt to the expected alteration of host-pathogen interactions.",10.1016/j.envres.2017.11.032,,0013-9351,1096-0953,,FEB,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.11.032,29202413

"Traini, C; Menier, D; Proust, JN; Sorrel, P",Transgressive systems tract of a ria-type estuary: The Late Holocene Vilaine River drowned valley (France),2013,MARINE GEOLOGY,337,,140,155,,"The understanding of control parameters of estuarine-infilling at different scales in time and space is important for near-future projections and better management of these areas facing sea-level change. During the last 20 years, the stratigraphy of late Quaternary estuaries has been extensively investigated leading to the development of depositional models which describe the sedimentary facies distribution according to changes in sea level, tidal range and wave activity but few of them describe in detail the influence of the estuarine geomorphology. On the Atlantic coast, recent studies provide a detailed understanding of the sedimentary infill succession of incised valleys during the late Holocene transgression with recent emphasis on the macrotidal bay of the Vilaine River in South Brittany. The latter has shown the importance of the inherited morphology in controlling the preservation of the sedimentary deposits. However, until now, there has been little information available on the geometry of the underlying bedrock of the estuary and its immediate approaches including the Holocene history of the most proximal part of the Vilaine River estuary. The recent acquisition of very-high resolution seismic reflection (Chirp) and sediment core data in the Vilaine Estuary provides the opportunity to address several of these issues leading to the identification of the controlling factors that played a role in the sedimentary filling of the estuary. The estuary of the Vilaine River is one of the most sheltered estuaries of the Atlantic coast and thus shows an excellent record of the successive transgressive phases since the last glacial period. The valley of this ria-type estuary is incised in the Hercynian magmatic and metamorphic rocks of the Armorican Massif along the striking branches of the South Armorican Shear Zone and filled with well-stratified sediments. The study of the morphology of the substratum in the estuary reveals narrow paleovalleys (I km wide) with a maximum depth of 20 m. The shapes and dimensions of these paleovalleys are comparable with those observed upstream in the present-day Vilaine River valley. Fades analysis of seismic and sedimentary data, complemented by 21 AMS radiocarbon age dating, enables the reconstruction of the infilling of the estuarine valley. The valley is filled by Pleistocene to early Holocene alluvial, coarse-grained, pebbly sands overlain by mid- to late Holocene marine sands, silts and muds. From 10,000 to 5000 cal. BP, the marine transgression shows a rapid initial phase of transgression followed by a progressive slowing down which can be recognised over more than 90 km in an upstream direction. The rapid transgression developed homogeneously over the entire length of the estuary with a widespread expression of tidal currents (tide-dominated estuary). The slow phase of the transgression gives rise to a differentiated expression of the hydrodynamic factors according to the geomorphological setting. The sedimentary deposits of the innermost and narrow part of the estuary reflect a strong control of tidal and river currents when the influence of tidal currents increases at the expense of fluvial control in a downstream direction. The sedimentary filling of the outer reaches of estuary shows a strong influence of tidal currents modulated by changes in sea level where, from 5700 to 3000 cal. BP, the progressive decrease in accommodation space promotes the expression of wave action (wave-dominated estuary). Finally, from 5000 years BP to present day, the stabilisation of sea level gives birth to scour and lag sedimentary morphologies (scour and lag estuary). The sedimentary record appears thus strongly marked by the Holocene transgression and the geomorphological setting where hydrodynamic parameters superimposed on the geomorphological and eustatic contexts expressed in different ways in time and space govern the evolution of the estuarine system.

Although BRD infection is often lethal, some clams recover by mineralizing a new repair shell layer, which covers the brown deposit and fully isolates it from living tissues. In order to understand this specific shell repair process, the microstructures of repaired zones were compared to those of shells unaffected by BRD. In addition, the organic matrix associated with unaffected shells and to repair patches were extracted and compared by biochemical and immunological techniques. Our results show that the repaired zones exhibit microstructures that resemble the so-called homogeneous microstructure of the internal layer, with some marked differences, like the development of crossed-acicular crystals, which form chevron-like patterns. In the three tested batches of repaired layers, the matrices exhibit certain heterogeneity, i.e., they are partially to widely different from the ones of shells unaffected by BRD, as illustrated by SOS-PAGE and by serological comparisons. Our results strongly suggest a modification of the secretory regime of calcifying mantle cells during the shell repair process.

The stomach, including digestive glands, was the major digestive organ for both carbohydrate and protein. The optimum conditions for amylase activity were 40 degrees C and pH 7; for acidic proteinases they were 60 degrees C and pH 5. Two main alkaline proteinases were found in the intestine, with optimum conditions of 30 degrees C and pH 8 and 60 degrees C and pH 8.

The most recent advances deal more particularly with the structure of shell biominerals at nanoscale and the identification of an increasing number of shell matrix protein components. Although the matrix is quantitatively a minor constituent in the shell of mollusks (less than 5% w/w), it is, however, the major component that controls different aspects of the shell formation processes: synthesis of transient amorphous minerals and evolution to crystalline phases, choice of the calcium carbonate polymorph (calcite vs aragonite), organization of crystallites in complex shell textures (microstructures). Until recently, the classical paradigm in molluscan shell biomineralization was to consider that the control of shell synthesis was performed primarily by two antagonistic mechanisms: crystal nucleation and growth inhibition. New concepts and emerging models try now to translate a more complex reality, which is remarkably illustrated by the wide variety of shell proteins, characterized since the mid-1990s, and described in this chapter. These proteins cover a broad spectrum of pI, from very acidic to very basic. The primary structure of a number of them is composed of different modules, suggesting that these proteins are multifunctional. Some of them exhibit enzymatic activities. Others may be involved in cell signaling. The oldness of shell proteins is discussed, in relation with the Cambrian appearance of the mollusks as a mineralizing phylum and with the Phanerozoic evolution of this group. Nowadays, the extracellular calcifying shell matrix appears as a whole integrated system, which regulates protein-mineral and protein-protein interactions as well as feedback interactions between the biominerals and the calcifying epithelium that synthesized them. Consequently, the molluscan shell matrix may be a source of bioactive molecules that would offer interesting perspectives in biomaterials and biomedical fields.

"Purcell, SW; Cheng, YW",Experimental restocking and seasonal visibility of a coral reef gastropod assessed by temporal modelling,2010,AQUATIC BIOLOGY,9,3,227,238,,"Assessing the survival of restocked marine invertebrates is complicated by crypticity and seasonal visibility of animals at release sites. We investigated local enhancement of trochus Trochus niloticus (Gastropoda) on 3 coral reefs in Western Australia. 12 000 tiny hatchery-produced juveniles, 1 to 4 mm basal shell width (BSW), were released onto each of 4 intertidal sites on each reef. Visual surveys were conducted at stocked sites and control sites on each reef at 3-monthly intervals. Juvenile trochus <25 mm BSW hide within the reef matrix and are found rarely on the upper reef surfaces, so detectable enhancement was expected from 12 mo after release, when they would be at sub-adult size (25 to 50 mm BSW). Abundance estimates of wild sub-adults fluctuated seasonally, and appear related to heat stress; i.e. they tended to be more exposed on the reef surface in periods of higher cloud cover and/or lower temperature. A cyclical trend in the abundance of sub-adult trochus is attributed to seasonal variation in their visibility in censuses. Temporal changes in adult abundance showed no consistent pattern. Due to the lag in detecting stocking of sub-adults and the cyclical nature of population estimates, we tested stocking success using a nonlinear mixed-effects model. From 12 to 18 mo post-release, sub-adults at stocked sites were more abundant (54% increase) compared to control sites. Although statistically significant, the absolute enhancement was small. Variation in the stocking effect among sites underscores the need for multiple sites in restocking. Releases of tiny, cultured trochus juveniles could be used to rebuild nucleus breeding populations for fishery restocking, but improved release methods leading to higher survival of juveniles are needed to make this approach cost-effective.",10.3354/ab00253,"Purcell, Steven/0000-0002-6227-6454",1864-7790,1864-7782,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ab00253,

In order to identify likely natural settlement locations for larvae of this species, laboratory-reared larvae were settled onto substrata collected from within and near an adult L. digitalis habitat. Of larvae exposed to rock chiseled from within high-intertidal adult habitat, 31.0% and 23.3% underwent metamorphosis during two separate experiments. Similarly, an unidentified filamentous green alga that was isolated from this rock induced metamorphosis in 26.6% and 8.7% of larvae during additional experiments. In contrast, larvae did not metamorphose upon bare rocks or upon rocks encrusted with a crustose corraline alga (CCA) that were collected from lower intertidal zones, nor did they metamorphose upon the macroalgae Ulva sp., Enteromorpha contorta, Alaria marginata, or Polysiphonia sp. The presence of mucus from adult conspecifics during these experiments did not enhance metamorphosis onto rock taken from adult habitat, ut it did induce metamorphosis in an average of 13.5% and 7.0% of larvae introduced to the mid-intertidal bare rock and CCA substrata, respectively. Finally, 38.0% and 34.4% of larvae from two experiments underwent metamorphosis when exposed to the high-intertidal barnacle Pollicipes polymerus.

The aim of this study was to assess the spectrum of allergy to South African bony fish (Class Teleosti), crustaceans and molluscs and to confirm or refute suspected allergy, specifically to bony fish, by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). Design. Patients were recruited by means of a seafood allergy questionnaire. Subjects with reported allergy to hake, yellowtail, salmon and mackerel were investigated by means of skin-prick tests, RASTs and Western blot analysis. For those subjects with test results that were either all negative or equivocal, a definitive diagnosis of clinical sensitivity was made on the basis of DBPCFC. Setting. Volunteer population-based cohort in the Western Gape. Participants. 105 volunteer subjects with suspected fish allergy were recruited by advertising in the local press. Main outcome. Species-specific bony fish allergy was confirmed or refuted by DBPCFC. Results. The four most common seafood species reported to cause adverse reactions were prawns (46.7%), crayfish (43.8%), abalone (35.2%) and black mussels (33.3%). The four most common bony fish species to cause reactions were hake (24.8%), yellowtail (21.9%), salmon (15.2%) and mackerel (15.2%). Seven DBPCFCs were performed and two open challenges. Skin-prick tests produced one false-negative result. Western blots produced one false-negative and one false-positive result. The PAST had a 100% correlation with DBPCFC. Conclusions. Local bony fish represent a significant cause of clinical reactions to seafood in the Western Cape. Although skin-prick tests, RASTs and Western blotting tests assist in the documentation of an IgE responder state, confirmation of clinical sensitivity can only be made with certainty by means of DBPCFC.",,"Lopata, Andreas, Ludwig/0000-0002-2940-9235",0038-2469,,,FEB,,9107219

This study evaluated the abundance of Shewanella species in oysters and seawater from the Chesapeake and Maryland Coastal Bays at four sites between 2019 and 2021. Physicochemical parameters such as temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, pH, chlorophyll-a, rainfall within the last 48 h, total dissolved solids, and atmospheric pressure were also recorded to evaluate if there was a correlation between environmental parameters and the level of Shewanella. The highest total Shewanella counts were 1.8 x 107 CFU/g in oysters and 4.0 x 102 CFU/mL in seawater. 16S rRNA sequencing was performed on 1,344 representative isolates of which 890 (713 oyster, 177 seawater) were confirmed as Shewanella within 16 species. The top four species isolated from oysters and seawater were S. khirikhana a known shrimp pathogen (49%), S. marisflavi (19%), S. loihica (11%), and S. algae (8%). Testing for alpha and beta hemolysis were performed on all confirmed Shewanella isolates. Beta hemolysis was observed in 405 (46%) of the isolates of which 313 were in oysters and 92 in seawater. In oysters, beta-hemolysis was most prevalent in S. khirikhana (233 of 344 isolates, 68%), while in seawater 64 of 92 isolates (70%) were beta-hemolytic strains. Beta-hemolysis suggests that these could be potentially pathogenic strains. Correlations were performed between physicochemical attributes of the seawater and Shewanella counts. Only seawater temperature and dissolved oxygen correlated with Shewanella counts (r = 0.45 and - 0.41), respectively. No correlations were observed between the physicochemical parameters and Shewanella abundances in oysters. Results suggest that virulent strains of Shewanella may be present in oysters and seawater from the Chesapeake and Maryland Coastal Bays, perhaps as a consequence of rising seawater temperatures.",10.3389/fmicb.2025.1502443,,,1664-302X,,Jan-24,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1502443,39927266

There is tremendous variation in factors that influence the direction and success of marine larval dispersal, making accurate prediction exceedingly difficult. The key physical factor is the pattern of water movement, while two key biological factors are the amount of time larvae spend drifting in the ocean (pelagic larval duration - PLD) and the time of the year at which adult populations release larvae. Here, we assess the role of these factors in the variation of predicted larval dispersal and settlement patterns from 15 locations around Aotearoa New Zealand.Methods The Moana Project Backbone circulation model paired with OpenDrift was used to simulate Lagrangian larval dispersal in the ocean with basic vertical control across four differing PLD groups (7, 14, 30, and 70 days) for each of twelve months.Results Considerable variation was observed in the pattern of particle dispersal for each major variable: release location, PLD group, and the month of release. As expected, dispersal distances increased with PLD length, but the size of this effect differed across both release location and month. Increased and directional particle dispersal matched some expectations from well-known currents, but surprisingly high self-recruitment levels were recorded in some locations.Discussion These predictions of larval dispersal provide, for the first time, an empirical overview of coastal larval dispersal around Aoteaora New Zealand's main islands and highlight potential locations of barriers to dispersal.

Then, the increasing and decreasing phases of the population fluctuation were divided by calculating the inflection points of the models, which exhibited distinct seasonal trends of the soybean aphid populations in each year. In addition, multifactor logistic models were then established for the first time, in which the abundance of soybean aphids in the field changed with time and relevant environmental conditions.

Methods: Partial sequences of the 28S rRNA gene of 40 specimens representing 25 dactylogyrid species were analysed together with sequences from GenBank using Bayesian inference, Maximum likelihood and Parsimony methods. Monophyly of dactylogyrids infecting catfishes and the Ancyrocephalinae was evaluated using the Approximately Unbiased test. Results: The Ancyrocephalinae is a paraphyletic group of species clustering in three main clades as follows: (i) clade A comprising freshwater dactylogyrids from the Holarctic parasitising perciforms clustering together with species (Ameloblastella, Unibarra and Vancleaveus) parasitising Neotropical catfishes; (ii) clade B including species of Dactylogyrus (Dactylogyrinae) and Pseudodactylogyrus (Pseudodactylogyrinae) along with Ancyrocephalus mogurndae, and marine dactylogyrids with cosmopolitan distribution, parasites of scorpaeniforms and perciforms, along with the freshwater Cichlidogyrus and Scutogyrus (infecting African cichlids [Cichlidae]) and (iii) clade C containing exclusively dactylogyrids of siluriforms, freshwater and marine, with Palaearctic, Ethiopian, Oriental and Neotropical distributions; species of Aphanoblastella and Dactylogyridae gen. sp. 4 from the Neotropical region clustering together with species allocated in the Ancylodiscoidinae, along with species of Cosmetocleithrum, Demidospermus and Dactylogyridae gen. spp. Conclusions: The position of the Ancylodiscoidinae within a larger clade of dactylogyrids (ancyrocephalines) indicates that this subfamily does not represent a natural group. Instead, species allocated to this clade (dactylogyrids of siluriforms along with species of the Ancylodiscoidinae) should be considered as a separate subfamily within the Dactylogyridae. The erection of this taxon requires the search for morphological diagnostic characters in addition to phylogenetic information. A similar strategy should be considered for a new classification of the paraphyletic Ancyrocephalinae. Members of the three clades do not seem to share obvious morphological synapomorphies nor clear patterns in host-parasite associations, zoogeographical distribution or ecology. Clade A should be considered as the Ancyrocephalinae sensu stricto since it includes the type species Ancyrocephalus paradoxus Creplin, 1839. A new subfamily should be proposed to accommodate species currently allocated to Ancyrocephalinae clustering within clade B.

Fourteen test Ca sources [commercial limestone, granular limestone, shell mix, AIM-limestone, oyster shell, crab shell (CS), lobster shell (LS), blue mussel shell, blue mussel shell-clean, surf-clam shell, soft-clam shell, scallop shell, quahog shell, abalone shell, and whelk shell] were separated into their particle size groups that ranged from <0.05 mm, >1.0 to <1.41 mm, and >1.41 to <2.83 mm. Average concentration of Ca was 36 g/kg in all Ca sources (except CS and LS). Calcium content was 20.35 and 20.32% in CS and LS, respectively. The mineral composition analysis showed values of P varying from 0.03 to 1.8%, Mg from 0.01 to 1.2%, K from 0.005 to 0.32%, Na from 0.02 to 0.81%, Mn from 7.22 to 2168 mg/kg, Zn from 23.8 to 120.5 mg/kg, Fe from 0 to 37.9 mg/kg, Cu from 10.4 to 41 mg/kg, and boron from 0 to 163 mg/kg. There was significant interaction (P < 0.05) between Ca sources and time for solubility for different particle size of Ca sources. In vitro solubility was dependent upon Ca source and particle size (P < 0.0001) with small particle generally having a greater in vitro solubility than large particle at the same time. The in vitro solubility rate of these Ca sources would provide a new and adequate source of Ca and a steady rate of Ca during the dark period. It was concluded that the observed mineral concentration and in vitro solubility differences between the examined Ca sources could be exploited to ensure optimum supply of Ca and most minerals, but lower in vitro solubility and Ca content of CS and LS would likely limit the use of CS and LS.",10.3382/japr.2013-00752,,1056-6171,1537-0437,,SEP,http://dx.doi.org/10.3382/japr.2013-00752,

We evaluated geographic variation in interactions between most extant native populations of Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) and the associated resistant-propagule community (RPC) of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi, using a reciprocal cross-inoculation experiment with all factorial combinations of plant genotypes and soils with fungal guilds from each population.

In spite of numerous researches, the shell protein content of a limited number of model species has been investigated. This paper presents biochemical data on the common edible land snail Helix aspersa maxima, a model organism for ecotoxicological purposes, which has however been poorly investigated from a biomineralization viewpoint. The shell matrix of this species was extracted and analyzed biochemically for functional in vitro inhibition assay, for amino acid and monosaccharides compositions. The matrix was further analyzed on 1 and 2D gels and short partial protein sequences were obtained from 2D gel spots. Serological comparisons were established with a set of heterologous antibodies, two of which were subsequently used for subsequent immunogold localization of matrix components. Our data suggest that the shell matrix of Helix aspersa maxima may differ widely from the shell secretory repertoire of the marine mollusks studied so far, such as the gastropod Halioris or the pearl oyster Pinctada. In particular, most of the biochemical properties generally attributed to soluble shell matrices, such as calcium-binding capability, or the capacity to interfere in vitro with the precipitation of calcium carbonate or to inhibit the precipitation of calcium carbonate, were not recorded with this matrix. This drastic change in the biochemical properties of the landsnail shell matrix puts into question the existence of a unique molecular model for molluscan shell formation, and may be related to terrestrialisation.

Among the wide diversity of mollusc shell textures, nacro-prismatic shells represent a tremendous opportunity for the investigation of the SMP evolution. Indeed, nacro-prismatic texture appears early in Cambrian molluscs and is still present in the shell of some bivalves, gastropods, cephalopods and very likely also, of some monoplacophorans. One key question is to know whether these shells are constructed from similar matrix protein assemblages, i.e. whether they share a common origin. Most of the molecular data published so far are restricted to two genera, the bivalve Pinctada and the gastropod Haliotis. The shell protein content of these two genera are clearly different, suggesting independent origins or considerable genetic drift from a common ancestor. In order to describe putatively conserved mollusc shell proteins, here we have investigated the SMP set of a new bivalve model belonging to another genera, the edible mussel Mytilus, using an up-to-date proteomic approach based on the interrogation of more than 70,000 EST sequences, recently available from NCBI public databases. We describe nine novel SMPs, among which three are completely novel, four are homologues of Pinctada SMPs and two are very likely homologues of Haliotis SMPs. This latter result constitutes the first report of conserved SMPs between bivalves and gastropods. More generally, our data suggest that mollusc SMP set may follow a mosaic pattern within the different mollusc models (Mytilus, Pinctada, Haliotis).

We describe here the structure of the hemocyanin Helix lucorum (H1H), species in the series of molluscan hemocyanins. In contrast with other molluscan hemocyanins, three different hemocyanin isopolypeptides were isolated from the hemolymph of the garden snail H. lucorum, named as beta-H1H, alpha(D)-H1H and alpha(N)-H1H. Their molecular masses were determined by size exclusion chromatography to be 1068 kDa (beta-H1H) and 1079 kDa (alpha(D)-H1H, and alpha(N)-H1H). Native H1H exhibits a predominant didecameric structure as revealed by electron microscopy and additionally few tridecamers are shown in the electron micrographs of H1H resulting from the association of a further decamer with one didecamer. The three isoforms are represented mainly as homogeneous didecamers, but they have different behaviour after dissociation and reassociation in the pH-stabilizing buffer, containing 20 mM CaCl2. All isoforms were reassociated into didecamers and tubules with different length, but in contrast to alpha(D)-H1H isoform, longer tubules were observed in beta-H1H. Moreover the structure of beta-H1H was analysed after limited proteolysis with trypsin followed by FPLC and HPLC separation of the cleavage products. Eight different functional units were identified by their N-terminal sequences and molecular masses.

In the presence of different concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions and pH values, the subunits differ not only in their reassociation behaviour, but also in their formation of helical tubules and multidecamers. RvH1 revealed a greater stability at higher pH values compared to RvH2. Overall, the stability of reassociated RvH and its structural subunits was found to be pH-dependent. The increasing stability of native Hc and its subunits, shown by pH-induced CD transitions (acid and alkaline denaturation), can be explained with the formation of quaternary structure. The absence of a Cotton effect at temperatures 20-40 degrees C in the pH-transition curves of RvH2 indicates that this subunit is stabilized by additional factors, e.g.: non-ionic/hydrophobic stabilization and interactions of carbohydrate moieties. A similar behaviour was observed for the T-transition curves in a wide pH interval for RvH and its structural subunits. At higher temperatures, many of the secondary structural elements are preserved especially at neutral pH, even at extreme high temperatures above 90 degrees C the protein structures resemble a globule state.

Our aim is to describe the potential mis-representations that energy budgets can produce and draw together the various criticisms levied at energy budgets. While such budgets purport to represent accurately energy allocation we, by discussing the literature, propose that many offer little. This is because in practice they rarely reflect actual energy relationships due to problems with their empirical derivation. These problems include both the omission of some energy budget terms (such as dissolved organic matter, non-lethal predation and metabolic faecal loss) and their underestimation (e.g. mucus production). Recalculation of budgets to account for these terms often results in new conclusions being drawn. Moreover, problems of extrapolation of measurements made in the laboratory to the field, coupled with misconceptions over the expression of temporal and spatial variation in budget terms, produce budgets that are both approximate and specific to an individual or population at the time each budget is constructed. In addition, the set of assumptions that are used in the construction of one budget are rarely the same as those for another and so budgets should be used with extreme care in comparative studies. We suggest that energy budgets have little value in the context of other studies and are of interest and value only as descriptors under a set of what should be well-defined assumptions. We urge caution in their use and propose that more modest studies of energy allocation with precise goals are more appropriate.",,"Brand, Alison/0000-0002-4548-2360",0003-455X,1797-2450,,,,

To test this hypothesis, we compared the population genetic structure of P. hoplura to that of Boccardia polybranchia since both species have similar larval developmental modes (and consequently natural dispersal potential) and distribution ranges in southern Africa. However, since B. polybranchia is not a pest, its population structure should reflect the effects of only biogeographic barriers on natural dispersal. Boccardia polybranchia was collected from five wild sites along the South African coast, and P. hoplura from seven wild sites and four oyster farms; two each were on-shore and off-shore. Analyses of mtDNA Cyt b sequence data indicate two distinct lineages for B. polybranchia, supporting Cape Point as a biogeographic barrier to the dispersal of larvae. In contrast, no distinct geographic lineages were identified for P. hoplura occurring in the wild, and haplotype sharing suggest possible cross infestation between farm and nearby wild sites. At farms the genetic diversity of P. hoplura is lower but also more structured, suggesting separate anthropogenic introductions at each site possibly from genetically distinct source populations. Furthermore, more limited genetic sharing was detected between worms from on-shore and nearby wild sites, whereas the opposite was observed for off-shore farms and associated wild sites. This suggests that populations in on-shore farms are more contained with most of the individuals carrying parasites corresponding to the source of introduction while those on off-shore farms display much more genetic exchange with wild populations.

The EPC is defined as a substantial thickening of both the spire callus and the callus on the ventral shell surface such that it covers 50% or more of the surface. Caenogastropods as a whole construct the EPC convergently, using a variety of low-density, poorly organized microstructures that are otherwise uncommon in caenogastropod non-callus shell construction. Within clades, however, we see evidence for parallelism in decreased regulation in both the shell and callus microstructure. Low-density and poorly ordered microstructure-such as used for the EPC-uses less organic scaffolding and is less energetically expensive than normal shell microstructure. This suggests the EPC functions to rapidly and inexpensively increase shell thickness and overall body size. Tests of functional ecology suggest that the EPC might function both to defend against crushing predation through increased body size and dissipation of forces while aiding in shell orientation of highly mobile gastropods.

Hepatopancreas assays revealed optimal activity at pH 4, 9-10 and 10 for wild and pH 3, 8, and 9, for cultured octopuses, for total proteinases, trypsin and chymotrypsin, respectively. In the gastric juice, maximum activity was recorded at pH 6, 8, and 7 for total proteinases, trypsin, and chymotrypsin, respectively for both wild and cultured octopus. A reduction on enzyme activity of 70 and 20% was observed in HP and GJ extracts, respectively when protease inhibitor Pepstatin A was used. That result suggests that the main proteases in the HP were aspartic acid proteinases type (possibly Cathepsin D) and some of them were present in the GJ. Dissociating discontinuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed activity bands between 20 and 28, 30 and 34, 35 and 45, 60 and 70 kDa, and a last one between 75 and 100 kDa. We concluded that extracellular digestion of O. maya takes place in an acid environment, around pH 6. In contrast, intracellular digestion in the HP is developed at pHs between 3 and 4, where cathepsin D could be the most important enzyme for O. maya.",10.1007/s10499-010-9360-5,"Santos Ricalde, Ronald/0000-0002-6730-619X; Alvarez-Gonzalez, Carlos Alfonso/0000-0001-9240-0041; Pascual Jimenez, Cristina/0000-0002-8789-8102; Rosas, Carlos/0000-0002-1301-7368; Mascaro, Maite/0000-0003-3614-4383",0967-6120,1573-143X,,JUN,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-010-9360-5,
