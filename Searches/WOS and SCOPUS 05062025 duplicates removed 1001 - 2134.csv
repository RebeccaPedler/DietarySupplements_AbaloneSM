Turbot (Scophthalmus maximus (L.)) is a cold-water marine fish, and in our previous studies, selecting a high-temperature resistant strain (HR) which increased the upper limit of high-temperature tolerance by more than 2 degrees C. The study evaluated the difference of the thermal tolerance between the high-temperature resistant strain (HR) and general group (GG) by using Arrhenius break temperatures (ABT). The ABT between them showed a significant difference that suggested different levels of thermal resistance. The result was consistent with assessments of upper thermal tolerance, as well as the activity of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. Meanwhile, the key genes regulating cardiac performance were analyzed in molecular level. Quantitative real-time PCR results demonstrated that the RNA expression of beta-ARs in the heart at increasing temperature followed an upward trend. However, the expression of mmp2, timp2, fosa, and pcna genes in the heart decreased. Additionally, western blot results demonstrated that the levels of beta 1-AR and beta 3-AR protein expression steadily increased. Overall, in response to acute thermal stress, the primary effector genes in the beta-AR signalling pathway were beta-ARs. Our study identified an effective and accurate measurement for evaluating the turbot's thermal tolerance and initially explored the molecular mechanisms that regulate cardiac performance under thermal stress. These would be greatly beneficial in aquaculture and breeding projects of turbot.",10.1007/s10695-025-01518-7

In this study, we report the molecular characterization and immune responses of CALR homolog from disk abalone (AbCALR). The full length AbCALR cDNA (1837 bp) had an ORF of 1224 bp. According to the multiple alignments analysis, N- and P-domains were highly conserved in all the selected members of CALRs. In contrast, the C-domain which terminated with the characteristic ER retrieval signal (HDEL) was relatively less conserved. The phylogenetic analysis showed that all the selected molluscan homologs clustered together. Genomic sequence of AbCALR revealed that cDNA sequence was dispersed into ten exons interconnected with nine introns. AbCALR mRNA expression shows the significant (P < 0.05) up-regulation of AbCALR transcripts in hemocytes upon bacterial (Listeria monocytogenes and Vibrio parahaemolyticus), viral (Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus; VHSV) and immune stimulants (LPS and poly I:C) challenges at middle and/or late phases. These results collectively implied that AbCALR is able to be stimulated by pathogenic signals and might play a potential role in host immunity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, the slow growth of abalone species impedes the health development of the abalone farming industry. In this study, the genome-wide association study (GWAS) for the growth related traits in Pacific abalone was performed. Genetic parameters of 10 growth-related traits in 222 individuals of the Pacific abalone were estimated by using 1,431,014 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected by whole genome resequencing (WGS). A total of 263 significant SNPs associated with growth traits were identified. Seven of these SNPs were further shown to be reliable growth-associated markers in a new validation population containing 1059 samples. In addition, 62 genes, including fgfr2, bmp7, cubn, rala, gpam, and adamts9, harboring significant markers were considered candidate genes, which may affect growth-related traits associated with various biological processes, such as cell proliferation, glycometabolism, and lipid metabolism. Our results will not only improve our understanding of the genetic architecture of abalone growth traits but also provide valuable SNPs for the marker-assisted selection and breeding of the Pacific abalone.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.736820
"Hansen, SC; Gosselin, LA","Do predators, handling stress or field acclimation periods influence the survivorship of hatchery-reared abalone Haliotis kamtschatkana outplanted into natural habitats?",2013,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,23,2,246,253,,"Northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana) in British Columbia, Canada, are listed as endangered and are protected from fishing, yet their populations continue to decline. It is suspected that supplementation of wild populations with hatchery-reared abalone will be necessary for the recovery of this species. This study examines the magnitude, timing, and causes of post-outplanting mortality of hatchery-reared late-juvenile northern abalone. Abalone survivorship declined precipitously following outplanting, with 83% of abalone surviving 24 h after release and only 34% surviving 2 weeks in the wild. Handling, tagging, and temperature variations experienced during the outplanting procedure did not cause mortality. The majority of the abalone mortality in this study was attributable to predators. Additional factors accounted for only 12% mortality over 7 d. A 1-week acclimatization period within predator exclosures did not improve subsequent survival of outplants. These results demonstrate that the ouplanting of hatchery-reared abalone as a method of restoring wild populations of this endangered species is primarily constrained by high mortality during the first few days after outplanting, and that almost all of this early mortality is caused by predation. Predation mortality will therefore have to be overcome if outplanting of hatchery-reared juvenile abalone is to be an effective restoration strategy.Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",10.1002/aqc.2315

Hatchery-reared Haliotis rubra larvae and juveniles were successfully batch-tagged with distinct and persistent marks, enabling unambiguous differentiation from wild conspecifics when recaptured. Larvae were batch-tagged with the epifluorescent dye calcein. Experiments demonstrated that the batch-tagged larval shell was clearly visible in the spire of juvenile shells after 260 days. The recapture of batch-tagged and released larvae from natural reefs after 533 days at liberty also confirmed the persistence of this tag. A reliable and cost-effective method for batch-tagging juveniles was achieved with the use of an artificial diet that resulted in a distinctive blue-green coloration of the shell. This coloration differentiated released juveniles from wild conspecifies, was easily observed with the naked eye, and persisted on the spire of individuals for 777 days at liberty. These batch-tagging protocols allow large numbers of H. rubra larvae and juveniles to be distinctly tagged for long periods of time, enabling reliable estimation of survival after release and individual growth. It is likely that these techniques could also be applied to other abalone species.",10.2983/035.029.0117

Concentrations of Cd and Pb, two non-essential metals, in the muscles of abalones decreased as the organisms became older. In addition, no significant difference was apparent in Cu, Mn, and Zn concentrations, three essential metals, with increases in shell length (age), although a close negative linear relationship with growth was observed in Zn in one habitat.

Calcified layers include a simple prismatic and a nacreous layer, the latter being composed of sheet nacre, which is uncharacteristic of gastropods. Growth lines were deposited in the nacreous layer of animals, even under controlled laboratory conditions. In animals of known age, three lines were deposited in the first year and one in each subsequent year. Rate of deposition of lines was not related to diet, temperature, or photoperiod.",
"Hirata, H","Systematic aquaculture: yesterday, today, and tomorrow",2002,FISHERIES SCIENCE,68,,829,834,,"The harmonization between aquaculture developments and the conservation of aquatic environments is the key to sustaining aquaculture. One of the obstacles to this harmonization is the negative economic relationship between developments and conservation. In order to sustain a systematic aquaculture, we need to establish benefits for both the human economy and the biological economy. The polyculture of Ulva and fish has been conducted by our group since 1964, with differing intents. Sakai was able to develop an abalone culture that fed on the Ulva cultured in the fish farm, and these mollusks produced green pearls as a byproduct of this fish culture. In that way, human profit was harmonized with the biological economy. The whole aqua-crop ensilage (WACE) system has been lectured by Hirata since 1999. The fish culture introduces nutrients into the sea. The nutrients contribute to the growth of sessile organisms. Whole organisms are harvested and ensilaged to produce the probiotic feed. This feed is mixed with routine fish feed. Ruminated culture will also be applied for byproducing the rotifer in culture of fish. These systems will be developed in the future.",10.2331/fishsci.68.sup1_829
"Lopez, RZB; Mendiola, JY; González, MTS",Branchial Motion Assessment in Abalone Using Photoplethysmography,2023,AQUACULTURE RESEARCH,2023,,,,6672198,"The abalone, a gastropod mollusk belonging to the Haliotidae family, has been a subject of research with a focus on its behavior in response to various environmental factors, including temperature fluctuations and hypoxia. While existing studies have primarily explored abalone behavior in relation to environmental changes, there remains a significant amount to be discovered regarding their behavioral patterns. There are studies in which recordings of readings have been made (indirect methods) of the heart rate of the abalone since it is believed that it is one of the parameters affected due to the changes in temperature and dissolved oxygen in its environment. The main disadvantage of some procedures to measure heart rate in abalone is that an incision is made near the heart, through this incision the measurement is made using the photoplethysmography technique. Another parameter that is affected by these changes (temperature and hypoxia) is respiratory rate. Temperature is an important factor that can reduce oxygen solubility and thus alter abalone respiration; so in this work, we propose to use the technique of photoplethysmography: a method involving the measurement of changes in volume within a biological organ, which offers a unique opportunity to monitor these changes. We adapt this technique to measure gill movements in abalone, a critical indicator of respiratory activity in these marine mollusks. By utilizing a pulse oximetry setup and synchronous detection, we establish an innovative approach to gill movement analysis. This approach employs a pulse train and synchronous demodulation technique, the train of pulses is guided through an optical fiber to one of the respiratory orifices of the abalone to effectively detect and analyze the gill movements of abalone. Additionally, the role of frequency of its gill movements is highlighted as another critical variable of interest within the broader study of Haliotis fulgens, shedding light on the multifaceted nature of abalone behavior and responses to their surroundings. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of abalone physiology and behavior, offering insights into their adaptation to changing environmental conditions.",10.1155/2023/6672198

Under red and white light at 4L:20D, the body weight-specific growth rate of abalones was significantly higher than that of the 0L:24D group (P<0.05). At 16L:8D, succinate dehydrogenase activity decreased and lactate dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase activity and the lactic acid content significantly rose (P<0.05) in the red and white light groups. Under blue light, reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde content for each light cycle were significantly higher than those of the red and white groups (P<0.05). Under blue, white and red light, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, glutathione peroxidase (GP(X)) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) content gradually rose with increased duration of light exposure. Under red light, significant differences in these parameters were detected between the 4L:20D and 16L:8D groups (P<0.05). Under blue and white light at 16L:8D, values of T-AOC, SOD, GP(X) activity and GSH content were significantly lower than those of the 12L:12D group (P<0.05). Overall, these results indicate that red light at light cycles of 4L:20D and 8L:16D is optimal for the culture and production of H. discus hannai, as these conditions promoted food intake, growth and health maintenance as well as normal physiological metabolism of the organism.",10.1111/are.13162

Many aspects of such polyculture systems have been described, but little attention has been given to the impact of live seaweeds on the microbiological properties of the water that connects the algae and animals. In this investigation, the Pacific red alga Gracilaria textorii was cultured in a recirculated dual tank system (150 L) with the juvenile abalone Haliotis discus hannai. Dynamic changes of total bacteria (TB) and total Vibrio (TV) in the water of polyculture and monoculture systems were evaluated. Results revealed that (1) level of TB in the polyculture was constantly higher than in the monoculture over a 6.5-day period. While levels of TV in the polyculture was detected to be constantly lower than in the monoculture, (2) integration of G. textorii in the abalone culture changed the Vibrio compositions in the water as judged by the changes of bacteria colony types; (3) application of artificial diet led to dramatic increase of the levels in TB and TV in both systems at 12 h after application in the 24-h test and resulted in selective propagation of Vibrio in the water in the monoculture system; (4) polyculture of G. textorii with juvenile abalone in combination with feeding with live algal diet helped to maintain low levels of TV and the balance of the Vibrio composition; (5) living biomass of G. textorii was effective in preventing propagation of two purified Vibrio strains (V alginolaticus and V logei) in the water. These results provide a general basis of the dynamic changes of levels in TB and TV in a seaweed-abalone polyculture system with or without artificial diet in tanks.

It is induced by the type I interferon system (IFN alpha/beta) in various vertebrates, but its expression has not been identified or characterized in mollusks or other multi-cellular invertebrates to date. In this study, we isolated the Mx gene from a disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) normalized cDNA library. Mx cDNA was sequenced, cloned and compared to other known Mx proteins. The full-length 1664 bp of abalone Mx cDNA contained a 1533-bp open reading frame that codes for 511 amino acids. Within the coding sequence of abalone Mx, characteristic features were found, such as a tripartite guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding motif and a dynamin family signature. In addition, leucine residues in the C-terminal region displayed a special leucine domain at L-468, L-475, L-489 and L-510, suggesting that abalone Mx may have a similar oligomerization function as other leucine zipper motifs. Abalone Mx protein exhibited 44% amino acid similarity with channel catfish Mx1, rainbow trout Mx2 and Atlantic halibut Mx. Abalones were injected intramuscularly with the known IFN inducer poly I:C and RT-PCR was performed for Mx mRNA analysis. The results showed enhanced Mx expression in abalone gill and digestive tissues 24 h as well as 48 h after injection of poly I:C. Mx mRNA was expressed in gill, digestive gland, mantle and foot tissues in healthy abalone, suggesting that the basal level of Mx expressed is tissue-specific. There is no known Mx protein closely related to abalone Mx according to phylogenetic analysis. Abalone Mx may have diverged from a common gene ancestor of fish and mammalian Mx proteins, since abalone Mx showed high similarity in terms of conserved tripartite GTP-binding, dynamin family signature motifs and poly I:C enhancement of Mx mRNA expression.

Procedures-Articular cartilage explants were conditioned with a simulated digest of BO (BOsim) or DN (DNsim) at concentrations of 0, 0.06, or 0.18 mg/mL or indomethacin ONDOsim; 0 or 0.02 mg/mL) for 72 hours. Control explants received digest vehicle only. Explants were or were not stimulated with recombinant human-IL-1 beta (10 or 0 ng/mL) during the final 48 hours of culture. Concentrations of PGE(2), GAG and NO in media samples (mPGE(2), mGAG, and mNO concentrations, respectively) were analyzed, and explant tissue was stained fluorochromatically to determine chondrocyte viability. Treatment effects during the final 48-hour culture period were analyzed. Results-IL-1 increased mPGE(2), mGAG, and mNO concentrations in control explants with-out adversely affecting cell viability. Treatment with INDOsim blocked PGE(2) production and increased mNO concentration in IL-1-stimulated and unstimulated explants and increased mGAG concentration in unstimulated explants. Treatment with DNsim (0.06 and 0.18 mg/mL) reduced mPGE(2) concentration in IL-1-stimulated and unstimulated explants, reduced mNO,2 concentration in IL-1-stimulated explants, and increased mNO concentration in unstimulated explants. Treatment with 0.18 mg of DNsim/mL increased cell viability in the presence of IL-1. In IL-1-stimulated explants, BOsim (0.06 and 0.18 mg/mL) reduced mPGE(2) concentration, but 0.18 mg of BOsim/mL increased cell viability.

In the present study, the physicochemical characteristics and effects of Spirulina on ARPE-19 and HaCaT cells were monitored after mass-production, compared with conventional product. Gene ontology (GO) was analyzed using systems biology network that accounted for the function of Spirulina in human health. Spirulina powder had a smooth surface with adsorbing particles and contained sodium, magnesium, and potassium. Spirulina powder extracts in 0.1 x PBS, 0.1 M HEPES, 0.1 M NaCl, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and acetonitrile showed broad absorbance peaks at 300-450 and 500-700 nm. In ARPE-19 and HaCaT cells, Spirulina powder in PBS displayed proliferation at 2-20 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL, respectively. Cell viability levels of HaCaT cells were almost higher than 90% at 0.1-20 mg/mL. Despite cell susceptibility, phycocyanin, which is a component of Spirulina, helped maintain consistency of cell responses with Spirulina. Spirulina functions were explained by GO-terms, mainly binding, cellular process, and cell in the network, in terms of anti-oxidant activity.

Surveys on the southeast coast of Australia show a negative relationship between densities of C. rodgersii and H. rubra at several spatial scales, suggesting negative interactions. In intact algal beds, we used enclosures to estimate the effects and relative magnitude of intra- and interspecific competition on the body condition, gonad development and survival of C. rodgersii and H. rubra. An increased density of conspecifics led to declines in the dry gonad weight of C. rodgersii and in the dry foot and stomach content weights of H. rubra. The effects of interspecific competition were asymmetrical. Manipulations of H. rubra densities had no detectable effect on C. rodgersii. In contrast, in enclosures with added C. rodgersii, H. rubra showed reduced total and dry weights of stomach contents and increased mortality relative to controls without urchins. The effects of C. rodgersii on H. rubra could be linked to differences in feeding habits and morphology. C. rodgersii is a generalist herbivore, which, even at low densities, reduced the cover and standing biomass of total, brown and red algae relative to controls without urchins. In contrast, H. rubra is a specialist herbivore, which, even at high densities, had little effect on the cover and standing biomass of algae relative to the effect of C. rodgersii. This study suggests that the invader C. rodgersii is the superior competitor in interactions with H. rubra, and that its presence, even at low densities, affects the abalone fishery.",10.3354/meps07816

Land-based cultivation has the advantage of customization of high-quality biomass production. However, the high material and preparation costs of traditionally used enrichment media are a limitation of land-based cultivation of D. mollis and P. hecatensis. This study explores ways to reduce operational and management costs associated with controlling the culturing conditions of D. mollis and P. hecatensis without compromising biomass growth and quality in land-based tank cultivation systems. Five experimental treatments, 1) ambient seawater (AS); 2) von Stosch enrichment medium (VSE); 3) Guillard's f/2 medium (f/2); 4) commercial fertilizer, Jack's Special (JS); 5) JS with vitamin (JSV), were used in the present study. Growth rates, pigment, and protein content of D. mollis and P. hecatensis were measured. D. mollis showed faster growth rates than P. hecatensis, indicating that the former is more economically suitable for land-based cultivation based on this parameter alone. Growth and protein content of D. mollis exposed to VSE decreased due to insufficient nitrogen in the tissue. However, the protein content of D. mollis exposed to JS and JSV significantly increased without a decrease in growth. Palmaria hecatensis showed similar growth, pigment, and protein content regardless of the treatment, except in AS.

Melatonin treatment and irradiation using red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been reported to reduce oxidative stress in a few aquatic organisms. However, the effects of red LED irradiation and melatonin injection on the antioxidant capacity and degree of apoptosis in abalones, which are nocturnal organisms, have not yet been reported. In this study, we compared the expression levels of antioxidant enzymes, total antioxidant capacity, and the degree of apoptosis in abalones subjected to red LED irradiation and melatonin treatment. The results revealed that at high water temperatures (25 degrees C), the mRNA expression levels of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) genes and the antioxidant activity of SOD decreased in abalones in the red-LED irradiated and melatonin-treated groups compared with those in abalones in the control group. Although high water temperatures induced DNA damage in the abalone samples, the degree of apoptosis was lower in the red-LED irradiated and melatonin-treated groups than in the control group. Overall, the abalones in the melatonin-treated and redLED irradiated groups showed reduced oxidative stress and increased antioxidant enzyme levels under thermal stress compared with those in the control group.

All predictive modelling tools used to forecast the status and health of populations following restoration activities depend on a validated estimate of adult lifespan. Of the seven Haliotis species in California, white abalone is considered to have the highest extinction risk and was the first marine invertebrate listed as an endangered species under the Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA). Lifespan was previously estimated from observations of early growth; however, no study has generated ages for the largest white abalone. To address questions of age and growth, bomb radiocarbon (C-14) dating was used on shells from large white abalone. Measured bomb C-14 levels were compared to regional C-14 reference records to provide estimates of age, growth and lifespan. Bomb radiocarbon dating indicated that growth was variable among individuals, with a maximum estimated age of 27 years. The findings presented here provide support for previous age and growth estimates and an estimated lifespan near 30 years.

Four experiments were conducted, three at 25 degrees C and one at 20 degrees C, typically with 10-13 larvae per replicate and five replicates per treatment. Each assay lasted 48 h. Larvae typically became responsive to IBMX at least 24 h before they became responsive to adult homogenate and were always slowest to become responsive to excess K+, suggesting that IBMX acts downstream from the sites at which the other cues operate and that the upstream sites become operational later in development. Competent larvae also responded far more quickly to IBMX - usually within 6-8 h - than to the other cues. Excess K+ and cues associated with adult homogenate may take longer (24-48 h) to penetrate to their sites of action. Alternatively, IBMX may stimulate metamorphosis directly, possibly by increasing intracellular concentrations of cAMP, cGMP, or Ca2+, while the other tested substances may act instead to turn off production of an inhibitory factor, which must then degrade before metamorphosis can occur. In three additional experiments, competent larvae remained responsive to all three inducers during 3-4 days of starvation, indicating that the metamorphic pathway of H. elegans, once developed, is not readily degraded even under severe nutritional stress.

In this study, a molluscan IRAK-4 gene, saIRAK-4, was cloned for the first time from the small abalone (Haliotis diversicolor). Its full-length cDNA sequence was 2062 bp, with a 1548 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 516 aa. The molecular mass of the deduced protein was approximately 57.8 kDa with an estimated pI of 5.23, and showed highest identity (47%) to acorn worm Saccoglossus kowalevskii. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed saIRAK-4 shares conserved signature motifs with other IRAK-4 proteins, including the death domain (DD), serine/threonine/tyrosine protein kinase domain (STYKc), protein kinases ATP-binding region signature, serine/threonine protein kinases active-site signature and prokaryotic membrane lipoprotein lipid attachment site. Quantitative real-time PCR was employed to investigate the tissue distribution of saIRAK-4 mRNA, and its expression in abalone under bacteria challenge and larvae at different developmental stages. The 5aIRAK-4 mRNA could be detected in all examined tissues, with the highest expression level in gills, and was up-regulated in hemocytes and gills after bacteria injection. Additionally, 5aIRAK-4 was constitutively expressed at all examined developmental stages. These results indicate that saIRAK-4 could respond to pathogenic infection and may play an important role in the adult abalone immune system and early innate immunity in the process of abalone larval development.

Specific items include shrimp, lobsters, oysters, mussels, scallops, clams, crabs, krill, crayfish, squid, cuttlefish, snails, abalone, and others. Shellfish, in general, contain appreciable quantities of digestible proteins, essential amino acids, bioactive peptides, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, astaxanthin and other carotenoids, vitamin B-12 and other vitamins, minerals, including copper, zinc, inorganic phosphate, sodium, potassium, selenium, iodine, and also other nutrients, which offer a variety of health benefits to the consumer. Although shellfish are generally safe for consumption, their exposure to diverse habitats, the filter feeding nature of shellfish such as oysters, clams, and mussels, and unhealthy farming and handling practices may occasionally entail health risks because of possible presence of various hazards. These hazards include pathogenic organisms, parasites, biotoxins, industrial and environmental pollutants, heavy metals, process-related additives such as antibiotics and bisulfite, and also presence of allergy-causing compounds in their bodies. Most of the hazards can be addressed by appropriate preventive measures at various stages of harvesting, farming, processing, storage, distribution, and consumption. Furthermore, consumer safety of shellfish and other seafood items is strictly monitored by international, governmental, and local public health organizations.

To identify neuropeptide molecules that play key roles in the modulation, transcriptome analysis of the ganglia (e.g., cerebral and pleuropedal ganglia) of the abalone Haliotis discus hannai was performed. The long-read single-molecule real-time sequencing using the PacBio RSII platform generated 48,344 full-length transcripts, with an N50 length of 3,020 nucleotides (nt), a GC ratio of 44.76%, and a size range of 309-17,545 nt. Of these transcripts, 32,901 (68.1%), 40,515 (83.8%), 7,591 (15.7%), and 14,945 (30.9%) were annotated using the NCBI nonredundant, Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and Cluster of Orthologous Groups databases, respectively. Using in silico data mining, 18 putative neuropeptide genes were identified from the transcriptome of H. discus hannai. Comparative analysis revealed that the sequences of identified neuropeptides of H. discus hannai were conserved with other molluscan neuropeptide homologs; however, some features of H. discus hannai neuropeptides were found distinct from those of other molluscan neuropeptides. Interestingly, this is the first study to report a precursor encoding a DYamide peptide in molluscan, which is likely to be a homolog of DLamide peptides, which have been discovered only in annelids to date.

With limited vision, abalone primarily sense their world chemically, and pheromones may play an important role in settlement, attraction, recognition, alarm, and reproduction. Despite this, there has been no detailed investigation into pheromone substances, both in their precise biochemical nature or pheromonal function. In this study, we investigated the presence of pheromonelike substances from the hypobranchial gland of the abalone Haliotis asinina using bioassays, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The hypobranchial eland of many prosobranchial marine molluscs has been classified as a sex auxiliary gland releasing unknown substances during spawning. In our study, cephalic tentacle assays demonstrated that the cell extracts of the hypobranchial gland contain chemical cues that are sensed by conspecifics. An antibody against the sea slug attractin pheromone was used as a probe to localize a similar protein in the mucin-secreting cells of the epithelial lining the hypobranchial gland of both male and female abalone. The approximate molecular weight of this abalone attractin-like protein is 30 k Da in both males and females. Fractionation of hypobranchial gland extracts by C5 RP-H PLC could not selectively purify this protein, and no sex-specific differences were observed. We predict that the attractin-like protein could be one of a number of important proteins involved in maturation, aggregation, and/or spawning behavior of abalone.

Growth rates based on both length and weights are often calculated, but the process of disturbance for measurement will affect the results of most studies. In natural populations, constant (linear) growth in length has been supported, while logarithmic transformations for growth rates (length and weight) have been used for aquaculture studies. This study of growth of greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata , Leach) over a prolonged period (3 years) indicates that both data treatments are suitable. If weights are being used, then a growth model that allows for exponential growth, such as specific growth rate (SGR), must be used. If lengths are measured, then the calculation of simple differences in the lengths over time is sufficient. The apparent paradox in use of two forms of measure is comfortably rationalized as a result of the weight-length relationship and the von Bertalanffy relationship for this species. Thus, methods of minimal disturbance and stress, such as photographic estimation of length, could be used to accurately monitor growth trends in aquacultural studies as well as in industry.",10.1046/j.1365-2109.2003.00814.x
"Tegner, MJ; Haaker, PL; Riser, KL; Vilchis, LI","Climate variability, kelp forests, and the Southern California red abalone fishery",2001,JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH,20,2,755,763,,"Declines in landings of Southern California abalone fisheries and the eventual collapse of many stocks over the last two decades coincided with a period of greatly increased environmental variability. This included massive storms, an increase in the frequency of warm-water El Nino events after 1976, and an interdecadal-scale increase in sea surface temperatures. Kelp populations may be decimated by severe storms or warm water. Because of the strong inverse relationship between nitrate availability and water temperature, temperature is a good indicator of nitrate availability or stress SINCE kelp growth ceases in warm nutrient-depleted water, tissue decays, and standing stocks may be greatly reduced. Abalones are affected by the availability of the drift kelp on which they feed. Anomalously warm temperatures may affect reproduction, and altered current patterns may affect larval dispersal. Because water temperature varies with location in Southern California and each of the five exploited abalone species has its own thermal preferences, we chose to evaluate the role of environmental variability on population, of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) on three northern Channel Islands spanning a temperature gradient. We compared water temperature regimes and anomalies, monthly aerial surveys of canopies of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), and field evidence of poor abalone growth and reproduction during El Nino events. The severity of El Nino disturbances and long-term changes in kelp standing stocks both correlated with the temperature gradient. Declines of red abalone total landings and area-specific landings on the warmer Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Island began a decade after the large 1957-1959 El Nino. The subsequent collapse of many populations appears related to warm anomalies after the 1976-1977 regime shift, kelp declines, and poor reproduction coupled with fishing-induced declines in adult abalone density. Red abalone populations have persisted on cooler San Miguel Island where thermal anomalies had less effect and kelp canopy biomass has been more stable. Southern California abalones evolved in this disturbance regime, but the combination of extended periods of increased environmental variability with intense fishing pressure may have led to the loss of local populations, especially in warmer areas.",

In the abalone farming sector, many factors are known to influence abalone activity, but little is known about how shelter limitations affect behaviour. In this study, we investigated the behavioural responses of juvenile and adult ab-alones to shelter limitations and the relationship between abalone size and activity level. Cohorts of 139 adult and 272 juvenile Pacific abalones (Haliotis discus hannai) of farm origin were observed under laboratory con-ditions during a 2-week period with a high level of shelter availability and a 2-week period with limited shelter. We recorded the locomotion under the shelters in the daytime, their positions in aggregations just before the forage time window, and the number of foraging nights. Our data analyses confirmed that in conditions of shelter limitation, juveniles showed increased forage frequency variation, and both active and inactive showed juveniles decreased activity levels. In contrast, adults showed decreased forage frequency variation, and while active adults showed decreased activity levels, inactive adults showed increased activity levels. We found that shelter limitations decreased the forage frequency of juveniles by affecting their forage motivation, not by restricting their access to forage.The results improve our understanding of the differences in Pacific abalone behaviours at the juvenile and adult stages and provide us with valuable information for the future design of abalone culture tanks and cages.",10.1016/j.applanim.2023.105941

Dissolved signal molecules that cause sperm to orient and accelerate towards an egg could play pivotal roles in fertilization success, but such compounds are largely undescribed. This investigation considered the behavioral responses of red abalone (Haliotis rafescens) sperm to soluble factors released into sea water by conspecific eggs. Sperm in proximity to individual live eggs swam significantly faster and oriented towards the egg surface. Bioassay-guided fractionation was employed to isolate the chemoattractant, yielding a single pure, fully active compound after reversed-phase and size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography. Chemical characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated that the free amino acid L-tryptophan was the natural sperm attractant in H. rafescens. Eggs released L-tryptophan at concentrations that triggered both activation and chemotaxis in sperm, exhibiting significant activity at levels as low as 10(-8) mol l(-1). The D-isomer of tryptophan was inactive, showing that the sperm response was stereospecific. Serotonin, a potent neuromodulator and tryptophan metabolite, had no effect on sperm swim speeds or on orientation. In experimental treatments involving an elevated, uniform concentration of tryptophan (10(-7) mol l(-1)) or the addition of tryptophanase, an enzyme that selectively digests tryptophan, sperm failed to navigate towards live eggs. A natural gradient of L-tryptophan was therefore necessary and sufficient to promote recruitment of sperm to the surface of eggs in red abalone.",

The magnitude of the genotype by environment interaction (GEI) together with heritability (h(2)) accounts for this aspect. Despite the economic significance of abalones and the interest in genetic improvement programs for their cultivation, only one previous study has reported GEI estimations for this group of mollusks. The objective of the present study was to estimate h(2) and the existence of GEI for growth traits of Haliotis rufescens cultivated in Chilean farms with different environmental and management conditions. A total of 2 cohorts (2007 and 2009) of 50 and 42 families of full sibs (FS), respectively, were used. Replicates of each FS family of the 2007 cohort were distributed in two farms in the northern region of the country and were evaluated after 1 and 2 years of cultivation. For the 2009 cohort, replicates of each family were distributed in a farm in the northern region and a farm in the southern region of the country. The estimated h(2) values were significant for all traits, with the length and width of the shell and total weight varying primarily by cohort between 0.22-0.62, 0.16-0.58 and 0.40-0.53, respectively. The genetic correlations (r(G)) between traits were all higher than 0.82. The expected correlated responses for improving the total weight using the shell length as a selection criterion predict a selection gain (14-51%) similar to what would be obtained by selecting directly for weight (16-51%) in all environments examined. Thus, indirect selection by shell length and the direct use of total weight as a selection criterion would yield similar effects in terms of the increase in weight. High r(G), not significantly different from 1, were observed for the analyzed traits between replicates of the families in any of the farms compared, both within the northern region and between the northern and southern regions of the country. These high r(G) were indicative of non-significant GEI for the analyzed traits. Therefore, results suggest that one selective breeding program could provide improved red abalone for the industry in Chile with consistent results between farms located in different environments. Statement of relevance: Abalones are one of the most important mollusks in aquaculture due to their commercial value in international markets, especially in Asia; as such there are several efforts to develop abalone breeding programs in different countries. In this work we addressed a critical aspect for a selective breeding program, which is to know whether responses of productive traits are similar in different environments. Considering that the magnitude of the genotype by environment interaction (GEI) together with heritability (h(2)) accounts for this aspect, we estimated these genetic quantitative parameters for growth traits (total mass, shell length and width) in two cohorts of the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, cultivated throughout Chile. Results indicated that the application of selection by the shell length at age of harvest has the greatest potential for improving the production of H. rufescens. These improvements are practical (ease and accuracy in measurement), have indirect effects on the objective trait of selection (weight), and consist of a trait that is not significantly affected by genotype-environment interactions. In addition, the results obtained suggest that a single selective breeding program would be sufficient for the red abalone industry in Chile, as the response to selection of traits associated with growth would be similar in different environments. Red abalone is naturally distributed in California and Baja California coasts, and this information can be especially useful in planning breeding programs also in the west coast of USA and Mexico.

Various research and academic institutions in Southeast Asia such as the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center Aquaculture Department (SEAFDEC AQD) are carrying out research on commercially important marine species including 10 fish, 6 crustacean, and 7 mollusk species. Since fry availability is a major constraint in the development of culture systems, a major research thrust of SEAFDEC AQD is the development of commercially viable technologies for breeding and seed production of commercially important marine fish and crustaceans such as milkfish, groupers, snappers and mud crabs, in addition to the production of fry and juveniles of endangered and depleted species such as the sea horse and the tropical abalone for stock enhancement and sea ranching. Although hatchery production of milkfish and sea bass are now commercially viable enterprises, research is being pursued to improve fry quality through feed supplementation and to lower production cost by using alternative live or artificial feeds. Larviculture techniques are being developed for technically demanding species such as groupers and snappers. The recent success in larviculture of the mud crab Scylla serrata is expected to stimulate the growth of the mud crab industry in the region. Similarly, encouraging developments in the breeding and larviculture of the sea horse and mollusks such as the tropical abalone will provide the necessary support to carry out future stock enhancement and sea ranching programs for these species.

To determine the effect of bacteria, each stomach was incubated (at 25 degreesC for 20 h) in a completely randomized design, with and without an antibiotic mixture. For a time series measurement (exp. 2), four homogenates from wild abalone were used; the incubation mixture was followed up taking samples at 0, 1, 2,4, 8, 16, 20, 32, 64 and 72 h. The latter samples were also used to measure the enzymatic activity before and after a 72-h incubation, in the absence of antibiotics (exp. 3). Initial bacterial counts in the wild abalone homogenates were 459 colonies per mL. In the presence of the antibiotic mixture, no bacterial growth was observed. Initial cellulase activity was 1.6 Units. Cellulose degradation figures were low, even in the absence of antibiotics, indicating the low dependence of abalone on the nutrients derived from the digestion of the cell walls. Still, the addition of antibiotics depressed the digestion of cellulose (14.5 vs. 10.2%), suggesting the importance of live bacteria in the digestion process, and that the majority of the degraded cellulose is perhaps acted upon by endogenous enzymes. The time series experiment of samples from wild abalone, with and without antibiotics, showed quadratic effects on cellulose digestion y = 7.55 + .29h - .005 h(2) (r(2) = .2212), but no significant differences between treatments. The gradual increase in the digestion of cellulose, followed by a plateau is similar to what happens in ruminant digestion. The initial and final enzyme activity without antibiotics showed a significant reduction of 41.1% for the wild abalone whereas in cultured abalone a 50.9% significant reduction was observed. It seems that the cellulase complex enzymes present in the homogenates remain active after 72 h of incubation, even though their activity is lowered by about one half. Although the use of antibiotics assure the absence of live bacteria in the incubation mixture, the cellular enzymes possibly freed by the effect of the antibiotics could still be active for up to 72 h after the microbes are no longer viable. Thus the enzymatic activity attributed to the stomach itself could still be confounded.",

The black-tailed gull Larus crassirostris was the most frequently observed avian predator, and we observed the gull actively foraging on benthic invertebrates at the study site. In particular, we found frequent predation activities by the black-tailed gull on the abalone Haliotis discus hannnai. The abalone accounted for 56.3% of the total amount of the prey remains, and the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus intermedius and mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis were also major components of the prey remains and accounted for 14.6% and 11.8% of the total number, respectively. While the gull preys on the abalone over a wide size range (27.0-105.7 mm shell length), smaller size class abalone individuals (<40 mm shell length) were dominant in prey remains compared to the live abalone surveyed in the surrounding habitats. Among four time periods in a day, predation rate on the abalone was highest in the late afternoon. Predation rate on the abalone was higher on rising tides than falling tides, although no clear relationship was confirmed between the predation rate and the tidal height. The predation by the black-tailed gull might have large impacts on the shallow rocky reef ecosystem.",10.1111/maec.12529

Based on PCP toxicity in red abalone (6 h LC50 1.6 mg l(-1); 6 h NOEL = 0.8 mg l(-1)), animals were exposed in flowing seawater (14 degrees C) to a sublethal PCP concentration of 1.2 mg l(-1) and a water salinity of either 25, 35 or 45 parts per thousand. Phosphagen changes in foot muscle were monitored by surface-probe localized P-31 NMR. Upon PCP exposure, phosphoarginine (PA) levels declined and inorganic phosphate (Pi) levels concurrently increased. Dosing was terminated at a standard metabolic endpoint (MEP), defined as the time for the spectral peak height for Pi to reach one-half that of PA. This was on average 3.3 +/- 0.2 and 6.8 +/- 0.7 h at ambient salinity; 5.3 +/- 0.7 and 7.1 +/- 0.7 h for high salinity; and 4.0 +/- 0.5 and 6.5 +/- 1.0 h at low salinity, for red and black abalone, respectively. During recovery, all biochemical endpoints returned to normal; however, both onset and intensity of effects were influenced by changes in seawater salinity. Disposition of [U-C-14]PCP in both species was also examined to determine if the effects observed with NMR had a kinetic basis. Three sets of abalone (n = 3) from each species were exposed to each salinity (25, 35 and 45 parts per thousand), plus 1.2 mg l(-1) of [U-C-14]PCP. Red abalone were exposed for 3.5 h and black abalone for both 3.5 and 6.5 h (they represent the lowest average MEP for both species). Residues were quantified via tissue digestion and liquid scintillation counting. The 3.5 h total concentration factors (TCFs) for red abalone were not significantly different among the three salinities (P > 0.05) and ranged from 104 to 133. However, low salinity seemed to deter the uptake of [U-C-14]PCP in black abalone, as the TCF was over three times lower for abalone exposed to 25 parts per thousand at both 3.5 h (TCF = 19 +/- 11) and 6.5 h (TCF = 38 +/- 8) than at 35 parts per thousand (3.5 h TCF = 62 +/- 6; 6.5 h TCF = 119 +/- 11) and 45 parts per thousand (3.5 h TCF = 67 +/- 14, 6.5 h TCF = 115 +/- 8). Furthermore, the 3.5 h TCF for red abalone exposed to PCP at all salinities was similar to the 6.5 h TCF for black abalone exposed at 35 and 45 parts per thousand. Thus, black abalone appear to have greater resistance to the combined effects of PCP and salinity variations, which appears to be due to slower uptake of the biocide. While PCP is a potent uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, use of varying water salinities simulated an additional stress imposed on intertidal animals by transient or seasonal environmental changes.

However, it has been unclear whether the end product of alginate lyases (i.e. unsaturated monouronate-derived 4-deoxy-L-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronic acid (DEH)) is assimilated by abalone itself, because DEH cannot be metabolized via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway of animals. Under these circumstances, we recently noticed the occurrence of an NADPH-dependent reductase, which reduced DEH to 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate, in hepatopancreas extract of the pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai. In the present study, we characterized this enzyme to some extent. The DEH reductase, named HdRed in the present study, could be purified from the acetone-dried powder of hepatopancreas by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by conventional column chromatographies. HdRed showed a single band of similar to 40 kDa on SDS-PAGE and reduced DEH to 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate with an optimal temperature and pH at around 50 degrees C and 7.0, respectively. HdRed exhibited no appreciable activity toward 28 authentic compounds, including aldehyde, aldose, ketose, alpha-keto-acid, uronic acid, deoxy sugar, sugar alcohol, carboxylic acid, ketone, and ester.

This process, known as ocean acidification, is a potential threat to marine populations via alterations in survival and development. To date, however, little research has examined the effects of ocean acidification on rare or endangered species. To begin to assess the impacts of acidification on endangered northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana) populations, we exposed H. kamtschatkana larvae to various levels of CO2 [400 ppm (ambient), 800 ppm, and 1800 ppm CO2] and measured survival, settlement, shell size, and shell development. larval survival decreased by ca. 40% in elevated CO2 treatments relative to the 400 ppm control. However, CO2 had no effect on the proportion of surviving larvae that metamorphosed at the end of the experiment. Larval shell abnormalities became apparent in approximately 40% of larvae reared at 800 ppm CO2, and almost all larvae reared at 1800 ppm CO2 either developed an abnormal shell or lacked a shell completely. Of the larvae that did not show shell abnormalities, shell size was reduced by 5% at 800 ppm compared to the control. Overall, larval development of H. kamtschatkana was found to be sensitive to ocean acidification. Near future levels of CO2 will likely pose a significant additional threat to this species, which is already endangered with extinction due in part to limited reproductive output and larval recruitment.

However, for only 1 out of 5 independent cultures was a net decrease observed in dry organic weight during the complete period of larval development (5 to 7 days). In fact, there were net increases in dry organic weight from the oocyte (day O) to the newly formed veliger larva (2-day-old). These weight increases during early development could be explained by increases in the amounts of specific biochemical components of the larvae, relative to oocytes. The metabolic rates of larvae were measured (oxygen consumption) and used to compare (i) the required energy for development with (ii) the energy supplied from the catabolism of biochemical reserves. This analysis revealed that the cost of development for larvae could not be explained by the rates of use of the energy stores initially present in the oocyte. Larvae, from two independent cultures, could only supply 25% or 71% of their energy requirements by the use of internal reserves. Larvae of H. rufescens cannot use particulate foods and, thus, this energy resource cannot be invoked. Estimates of the contribution that dissolved organic material in seawater could provide to larvae, showed that this pool of exogenous material could supply the missing energy. It is suggested that nonfeeding larvae can feed, but that their only available nutrients are in a dissolved form.",10.2307/1541939

The tropical abalone, Haliotis asinina, in common with many other invertebrates contains a peptide with a similar structure to GnRH. This study looks at its possible involvement in reproduction by injecting groups of one-year-old female abalone at the mature phase by injecting them with synthetic H. asinina (Has) GnRH at doses of 0, 250 and 500 ng/g and then measuring the amount of material in nerve ganglia, ovary and hemolymph that cross-reacted with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for vertebrate LH and steroid, estradiol. Immunohistochemistry, using antibodies for the same two compounds, was also carried out to examine the location of immunoactivity in the tissues of the animals. There were slight (in some cases statistically significant) increases in LH-immunoactivity and estradiol in the hemolymph and tissues. However, this applied to the lower dose only (i.e the dose-response relationship was non-monotonic). Using immunohistochemistry, LH-immunoreactive cells were observed in types 1 and 2 neurosecretory (NS1 and NS2) cells within the cerebral and pleuropedal ganglia of H. asinina. In addition, LH-immunoreactive nerve fiber bundles were strongly detected in both ganglia. The immunoactivity against the estrogen appeared to be localized in the granulated cells within the connective tissue and trabeculae of the mature ovary. There was no positive staining in the cytoplasm of any stage of the germ cells. The interpretation of these findings is presently hindered by the fact that the homologous gene for vertebrate LH has not yet been identified in the genomes of any mollusks (so the cause of the immunostaining is as yet unknown) and also by the fact that mollusks are known to readily absorb steroids from the environment and store them long-term in the form of fatty acid esters. More work, involving identification of the protein that cross-reacts with the LH antiserum and also exclusion of the possibility that the estradiol is of exogenous origin, will have to be carried out before these findings can be used to manipulate reproduction in this species.",10.1016/j.acthis.2019.151454

Extending the larval period of non-feeding larvae strongly affects post-metamorphic survival and growth in a range of species. These 'carry-over' effects are assumed to be due to changes in larval energetic reserves but direct tests are surprisingly rare. Here, we examine the energetic costs ( relative to the costs of metamorphosis) of extending the larval period of the colonial ascidian Diplosoma listerianum. We also manipulated larval activity levels and compared the energy consumption rates of swimming larvae and inactive larvae. Larval swimming was, energetically, very costly relative to either metamorphosis or merely extending the larval period. At least 25% of the larval energetic reserves are available for larval swimming but metamorphosis was relatively inexpensive in this species and larval reserves can be used for post-metamorphic growth. The carry-over effects previously observed in this species appear to be nutritionally mediated and even short (< 3 h) periods of larval swimming can significantly deplete larval energy reserves.",10.1080/10236240400029333

The 65% recirculation treatment also exhibited a significant increase in mean seawater pH (0.2 pH units higher) due to the biological activity of the seaweed in the connected tanks. We found a significant positive relationship between the mean pH of seawater in the tanks and juvenile abalone growth rates across all treatments. There were no significant differences in the growth of dulse among treatments, but dulse growth did vary seasonally. Seawater phosphate and nitrate concentrations were depleted in the highest recirculation rate treatment, but ammonium concentrations were elevated, likely due to the abalone effluent. Overall, our results indicate that there are benefits to IMTA culture of seaweeds and abalone in terms of improving growth in land-based systems, which will reduce the time to market and buffer commercial abalone operations against the effects of ocean acidification during vulnerable early life stages.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738571
"Rogers-Bennett, L; Klamt, R; Catton, CA",Survivors of Climate Driven Abalone Mass Mortality Exhibit Declines in Health and Reproduction Following Kelp Forest Collapse,2021,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,8,,,,725134,"Marine ecosystems are vulnerable to climate driven events such as marine heatwaves yet we have a poor understanding of whether they will collapse or recover. Kelp forests are known to be susceptible, and there has been a rise in sea urchin barrens around the world. When temperatures increase so do physiological demands while food resources decline, tightening metabolic constraints. In this case study, we examine red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) looking at sublethal impacts and their prospects for recovery within kelp forests that have shifted to sea urchin barrens. Abalone are a recreationally fished species that once thrived in northern California's bull kelp forests but have recently suffered mass mortalities since the 2014-2016 marine heatwave. Quantitative data exist on the health and reproduction of abalone both prior to and after the collapse. The survivors of the mass mortality show a 2-year lag in body and gonad condition indices. After the lag, body and gonad indexes decreased substantially, as did the relationship between shell length and body weight. Production of mature eggs per female declined by 99% (p < 0.001), and the number of eggs per gram of female body weight (2,984/g) declined to near zero (9/g). The number of males with sperm was reduced by 33%, and the sperm abundance score was reduced by 28% (p = 0.414). We observed that these reductions were for mature eggs and sperm while immature eggs and spermatids were still present in large numbers. In the lab, after reintroduction of kelp, weight gains were quickly lost following a second starvation period. This example illustrates how climate-driven declines in foundation species can suppress recovery of the system by impacting body condition and future reproduction of surviving individuals. Given the poor reproductive potential of the remaining abalone in northern California, coupled with ongoing mortality and low kelp abundances, we discuss the need to maintain the fishing moratorium and implement active abalone restoration measures. For fished species, such as abalone, this additional hurdle to recovery imposed by changes in climate is critical to understand and incorporate into resource management and restoration.",10.3389/fmars.2021.725134

Local restoration efforts have focused on outplanting juvenile abalone, which is costly because of the husbandry required to raise abalone to outplanting size. This study tested if hatchery-produced larval pinto abalone could be successfully outplanted and if postoutplant growth of larval abalone differed from hatchery-raised animals. Wild broodstock were spawned. and some larvae remained at the hatchery for rearing, whereas most were transported to the Shannon Point Marine Center (SPMC) for outplanting. At two sites in the Salish Sea, larvae were outplanted at a density of 13,000 larvae m(-2) into two types of larval abalone modules (LAM): tented LAM (125 mu m Nitex tenting) and open LAM (no tenting). There were also control LAM with no tenting and no abalone. Larvae were also seeded in LAM in aquaria at SPMC to compare field and aquaria survival and to estimate emigration. Shell lengths of field, laboratory. and hatchery-reared abalone were measured to better understand if hatchery life compromises early growth. Four months after outplanting, abundance of settled abalone was significantly greater in tented LAM than open and control LAM. Control LAM contained no abalone, suggesting reproduction by wild abalone did not occur at the field sites. Open LAM had a mean outplant success of 0.1% (0-12 settled abalone) and tented LAM a mean success of 0.4% (16-35 settled abalone). Outplant success was higher in SPMC aquaria. Open and tented LAM had 1.5% and 3.0% success, respectively. Abalone found on aquaria walls outside the LAM accounted for 0.2% of the seeded abalone for both open and tented LAM. Four months after outplanting, shell lengths of field abalone were not significantly different from lengths of hatchery-reared abalone, suggesting hatchery conditions did not compromise growth rates of newly settled abalone. These findings suggest that releasing larval pinto abalone into tented field modules has potential to supplement wild stocks in the Salish Sea as a lower cost alternative to outplanting juveniles.",10.2983/035.039.0220

In recent years, Fujian in the southern region of China has become the chief abalone farming center, accounting for 85% of the total Pacific abalone yield. The practice of transferring abalone to northern regions to oversummer emerged because of challenges in Fujian, such as fouling, high temperature stress, and unexpected extreme weather events. From the view of ecology and conservation biology, however, the potential ecological risks of this practice should be considered as the abalone shells could act as vectors of exotic organisms. In this study, oyster samples from the shells of live, farmed abalones were collected in Fujian in southern and Rongcheng in northern China. The oysters were identified using a recently developed molecular method. In addition, the fouling oysters on Pacific abalone transferred to the northern region were monitored in a field trial. Survivorship and growth performance of the fouling oysters on the transferred abalones were determined through investigation of digital images taken at 2-wk intervals during the oversummering period. Results of the molecular analysis showed that fouling oysters collected from southern and northern regions are Crassostrea angulata and Crassostrea gigas, respectively. The field trial demonstrated that approximately half of the C. angulata, from the southern region, were still alive after a 6-mo oversummering period in the northern region. Findings from this study have important implications for aquaculture, the management and monitoring of cultured populations of Pacific abalone, and the conservation of wild oyster species in China.",10.2983/035.035.0307

Long-term survival of released hatchery abalone varied between releases but averaged about that expected for wild abalone. There was no significant effect of released juveniles on the persistence or recruitment of wild abalone. Significantly greater numbers of all (released and wild) abalone persisted at release locations through time, while the total number of wild abalone increased significantly through time at release and control locations. There was no significant difference in long-term survival of abalone released in clusters of high density (2-4%) or in a diffuse or concentrated array (0-9%).

The current status of the population in this key location is described using population and aggregation surveys from 2004 to 2007. We developed a size-based matrix model to assess the recovery potential of this low-density population. We incorporated fecundity parameters into the model, modified by empirical nearest-neighbor distance, aggregation size, sex ratio, and size-frequency data, to evaluate their influence on the population growth rate. We found the density of the population (similar to 170 abalone/ha) is an order of magnitude less than the minimum spawning density (2,000 abalone/ha) used by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for abalone management. The average aggregation size was similar to 2 abalone, and more than 50% of the abalone were solitary (no neighbors within a 2.5-m distance). The average nearest-neighbor distance was greater than 5 m in all 3 y, corresponding to an estimated fertilization success rate of similar to 20%. The per capita recruitment potential was 1.3-5.3 recruits per female in 2006 and 2007. Population growth rates (lambda) from the models including aggregation characteristics were 12%-18% less than the models with no aggregation information. A further 12% reduction in lambda occurred between models assuming high and low fertilization success (high, 1.04/y; low, 0.91/y), showing that inclusion of aggregation characteristics has a large impact on population viability analyses. Under the International Union for the Conservation of Nature threat categories, a population with a lambda of 0.91 would be classified as endangered. Based on these results, we define recovery targets for pink abalone as (1) aggregation size >= 5 abalone and (2) nearest-neighbor distance less than 1.6 m. We suggest aggregation characteristics will be important to include when quantifying recovery goals for depleted populations of species susceptible to reproductive Allee effects.",10.2983/035.032.0124

Between 2002 and 2005, the Bamfield Huu-ay-aht Community Abalone Project released 4.5 million larvae and 152,000 juveniles of the northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana) into Barkley Sound, BC. The purpose of this study was to estimate the long-term survival of outplanted abalone 3-7 years after their release and thus determine their contribution to local population densities at three different outplanting sites. We identified outplanted abalone by genotyping epipodal tentacles sampled from wild-caught abalone for seven microsatellite loci. We then used three different pedigree reconstruction programs: one that used genotypes from hatchery-reared siblings (pedigree 2.2), one that used the wild parent genotypes that were available (cervus 3.0), and one that used both sources of information (colony 2.0). Each program identified different but partially overlapping subsets of hatchery-outplanted offspring. From this we inferred that up to 26% of the individuals sampled at the main outplanting site were from hatchery spawnings. Despite this large contribution of hatchery-reared stock, the density of mature abalone at each site was below the level required for successful fertilization. More intensive outplanting efforts might increase population densities of this broadcast spawner above this minimum sustainable level. However, for supplementation to be successful, other factors that could reduce outplanted juvenile survival, including the low genetic diversity of hatchery-produced offspring and the low habitat quality of some outplanting sites, need to be monitored.",10.1007/s10592-012-0330-5

Twenty microalgal strains, isolated from rocky shores and sandy estuaries, were grown in the laboratory to produce young and matured monospecific biofilms. Abalone larvae were exposed to the different biofilm treatments and controls (no biofilms) for 7 (attachment and metamorphosis) and 14 (shell stage and survival) d. The larvae performed significantly better in biofilms compared with controls across microalgal strains, but attachment, metamorphosis, shell stage, and survival were generally less than about 50, 35, 25, and 25%, respectively. Some microalgal strains belonging to the same species but collected from different sites had different effects on the larvae, likely due to variations in biochemical composition and activity among strains. Although no clear relationship was found between the microalgal amino acid profiles and larval processes, percentage biofilm cover and total amino acids were positively correlated with some of these processes. In addition, abalone performed significantly better when exposed to mature compared with young biofilms. These results may be due to the greater amounts of microalgal cells and their extracellular polymers within older biofilms, which may cue larvae toward more nutritionally favorable environments.",10.1111/j.1749-7345.2011.00454.x

Further development of the sector will affect the provision of ecosystem services that maintain the livelihood of local populations. In particular, the current size and growth rate of China's mariculture has raised many environmental concerns, but very few studies of this sector have been conducted to date. Here, we report the resource use in the production of six main Chinese mariculture products (Larimichthys crocea, Apostichopus japonicus, Haliotis spp., Laminaria japonica, Gracilaria spp., Porphyra spp.), taking the city of Ningde as a case study. We used the life cycle assessment framework and the Cumulated Exergy Demand indicator to quantify resource use, and implemented a Monte Carlo simulation where model uncertainty was included using various methods. The mean exergy demand values of the production of one live-weight ton of large yellow croaker, sea cucumber, abalone, laminaria, gracilaria, and porphyra are 106 GJ eq., 65 GJ eq., 126 GJ eq., 0.25 GJ eq., 1.55 GJ eq., and 0.98 GJ eq., respectively. For animal products, 45-90% of the impacts come from the feed requirements, while in seaweed production, 83-99% of the impacts are linked to the fuel used in operation and maintenance activities. Policies oriented toward efficient resource management in the mariculture sector thus should take the farm design, input management, and spatial planning of marine areas as the main targets to guide current practices into more sustainable ones in the future. Improvements in all those aspects can effectively increase resource efficiency in local mariculture production and additionally reduce other environmental impacts both locally and globally.",10.3390/su11051396

This is the first report of cultivation of P. palmata in land-based tanks using isolated spores as seedstocks. Spores were released from field-collected tetrasporphytic fronds. A phenological study determined that tetrasporophytic fronds were fertile during the winter along the coast of northern France. This paper describes techniques for the induction of sporulation, for spore settlement and for incubation of germlings in 1.5-m-diameter tanks in semi-controlled conditions. The yield of released spores was in the range of 5000 to 25,000 g(-1) of fertile sections. Mean spore density on substrate placed in hatching tanks was 500 spores cm(-2). Spore germination occurred 3 days after inoculation and at this stage survival rate was high (80%). A few days after spore inoculation, both male and female gametophytes had germinated and a male to female ratio of approximately 1:1 was observed. Female gametophytic discs remained microscopic whereas males developed gametophytic fronds. Growth of plantlets was well correlated with the concentration of medium supplements. After 3 months of cultivation in tanks, survival rate was 35% and some plantlets measured more than 2 cm. At this stage, substrates covered with soft young fronds were transferred to an abalone hatchery to feed abalone juveniles. (C) 2004 Elsevier Science B.V.

H. australis can be readily ripened and spawned, but larval settlement has proved difficult. The current study addressed aspects of larval settlement (i.e., attachment and metamorphosis) in laboratory experiments and small-scale hatchery trials. Competence to metamorphose was first seen weakly in larvae at 8 days old at 14.5 degrees C, but larval metamorphosis rates increased progressively up to at least 12 days of age. In laboratory experiments, larvae showed a dose-dependent response to dissolved gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), with settlement peaking at 1 mu M (57% metamorphosis 4 days after settlement induction) and declining at higher and lower doses. Across a range of cues, metamorphosis was highest on crustose coralline algae (97 +/- 4% metamorphosis after 4 days), intermediate on 1 mu M GABA (55 +/- 14%), and low on diatom films (<20%). GABA combined additively with diatom film to give strong metamorphosis (81 +/- 6%). Metamorphosis induction by a diatom film was doubled if the film was pregrazed by juvenile H. australis (76% vs. 35%, P<0.0001), but the grazing effect appeared to be species specific, because pregrazing by Haliotis iris had no effect (41% vs. 35%, P = 0.720). The species-specific response to trail mucus appears to preclude GABA as being the main inducer of metamorphosis in this case. On hatchery plates, settlement on pregrazed biofilms was approximately 4-fold higher when the plates were horizontal rather than vertical (41% vs. 10% metamorphosis, P = 0.003). Settlement on ungrazed horizontal plates remained low even if those plates had been held in water with adult conspecifics, but without contacting the abalone. We conclude that tanks offering sloped or horizontal surfaces will be more effective than vertical plates for settlement of H. australis, and that pregrazed biofilms and/or GABA are promising settlement cues.",10.2983/035.029.0316

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling is considered as a prominent signaling pathway in vertebrate as well as invertebrate species. Within the signaling cascade, TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) and TNF receptor-associated protein (TTRAP) has been shown to have a crucial role in the modulation of immune signaling in animals. Here, we attempted to characterize a novel molluskan ortholog of TTRAP (AbTTRAP) from disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) and analyzed its expression levels under pathogenic stress. The complete coding sequence of AbTTRAP consisted of 1071 nucleotides, coding for a 357 amino acid peptide, with a predicted molecular mass of 40 kDa. According to our in-silico analysis, AbTTRAP resembled the typical TTRAP domain architecture, including a 5'-tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase domain. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis revealed its common ancestral invertebrate origin, where AbTTRAP was clustered with molluskan counterparts. Quantitative real time PCR showed universally distributed expression of AbTTRAP in selected tissues of abalone, from which more prominent expression was detected in hemocytes. Upon stimulation with two pathogen-derived mitogens, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), transcript levels of AbTTRAP in hemocytes and gill tissues were differentially modulated with time. In addition, the recombinant protein of AbTTRAP exhibited prominent endonuclease activity against abalone genomic DNA, which was enhanced by the presence of Mg2+ in the medium. Collectively, these results reinforce the existence of the TNF signaling cascade in mollusks like disk abalone, further implicating the putative regulatory behavior of TTRAP in invertebrate host pathology.

The settlement and metamorphosis are two critical stages during its development period, which has direct influence on abalone survival and production. The influence of reactive oxygen species (hydrogen peroxide) on abalone embryo and juvenile development were examined in this study. Larvae of Haliotis diversicolor supertexta were induced to settlement and metamorphose by exposure to seawater supplemented with hydrogen peroxide. They had the best performance at 800 mu mol/L. The concentration of 1 000 mu mol/L or higher was toxic to the larvae, as the larvae could settle down only at benthic diatom plates without complete metamorphosis. In addition, H2O2 adding time was critical to the larval performance. 24h after two-day post-fertilization was proved to be the optimal adding time. In this paper, two action mechanisms of hydrogen peroxide are discussed: (1) hydrogen peroxide has direct toxicity to ciliated cells, thus cause apoptosis; (2) hydrogen peroxide, as a product from catecholamines' autoxidation process in vivo, can reverse this process to produce neuro-transmitters to induce abalone metamorphosis.",10.1007/s00343-008-0238-6

Abalones are an important marine fishery resource and of cultural importance to Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. A highly priced marine delicacy, they are inherently vulnerable: individuals are slow-growing and long-lived and successful reproduction requires dense assemblages. However, their global conservation status is poorly understood. Using IUCN Red List methodology, we assessed the extinction risk to all 54 species of abalone (genus Haliotis). Of the 21 fished commercially for human consumption either now and/or in the past, 15 (71.43%) are classified as threatened, i.e., those identified as Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable. Of the 33 unexploited species, only five (15.15%) are so classified, making exploited species over four times more likely to face extinction, underscoring the impact of fishing on abalones already confronting a changing climate. The highest concentration of threatened species occurs along the North American Pacific coast. Here six of the seven species have been exploited, yet despite years of fishery closures with exemptions only in Alaska and Mexico, all are categorised as threatened. Climate driven stressors have led to mass mortalities, with competition from sea urchins and disease, aggravated by harmful algal blooms. In Australia the picture is mixed despite robust stock management, with some regions experiencing mass mortalities from marine heatwaves and viral spread. Poaching has reached its apogee in South Africa, where organised criminal gangs have reduced the legal fishery of Haliotis midae, 'perlemoen' almost to a footnote, accompanied by widespread recruitment failure. In response, the authorities have focused on abalone ranching and stock enhancement. In Japan, with a long history of abalone fishing, wild stocks are routinely supplemented with hatchery-bred juveniles. Collaboration between restoration aquaculture and fisheries, including sea urchin control and kelp restoration, offers hope for rebuilding stocks against a backdrop of escalating environmental stressors.",10.1371/journal.pone.0309384

Using transcriptome analysis and microstructural observations, we compared red-shelled (RS) and green-shelled (GS) variants to identify key genes and pathways associated with shell colour. The results reveal that GS variants exhibit higher expression of visual protein genes (e.g., RHO-opnGq), which are linked to light sensitivity and pigment synthesis. Additionally, RS variants show upregulated chitin biosynthesis genes (e.g., CHs-IA), potentially influencing shell structure and pigmentation. These findings suggest that these genes play a critical role in regulating pigment deposition and shell colour formation, while biomineralisation genes contribute to shell integrity.

Positive feedback is often presented as central in maintaining alternative ecosystem states, but no formal approach relates this part of theory to real world applications. Through qualitative modelling of community response to long-term perturbations, we define generic mechanistic links between positive feedback and the occurrence of alternative states. Positive feedback diminishes a system's overall resistance to change, and can create and maintain correlations in the relative abundance of variables that coincide with alternative states. Through specific models of the dynamics of Tasmanian rocky-reef communities, which are affected by climate and fishing and persist within alternative states, we demonstrate the ability of our theoretical framework to predict alternative states in ecosystems and inform management intervention. A qualitative knowledge of community structure permits a thorough analysis of system feedback and an assessment of the potential for an ecosystem to exhibit alternative states. We illustrate the usefulness of the approach to inform management priorities, and to focus monitoring and field research on the key drivers of ecosystem dynamics. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This study explored the potential impact of the proposed disposal of over 7 million m(3) of dredge spoil on a nearby fishery for the blackfoot abalone Haliotis iris. The range of sediment deposition predicted by models to occur on reefs inhabited by H. iris as a result of the dispersal of sediment from the disposal site was used to design controlled experiments between July and September 2011 to test the likely effects of sedimentation on: (a) behaviour and mortality of juvenile H. iris and (b) photosynthetic vitality of crustose coralline algae (CCA) that form nursery habitats for H. iris obtained from Brinns Point (45, 40.3'S, 170, 39.4'E). We observed no direct effects on the health or mortality of H. iris juveniles or the photosynthetic vitality of habitat forming CCA. H. iris did, however, avoid sediments by moving from predation refugia beneath cobbles to vertical surfaces on cobble edges significantly more often in sediment treatments compared to sediment-free controls. Deposited sediments were also found to inhibit righting response, key behaviour in allowing H. iris to reattach to the substratum following dislodgement. Results of this study suggest that indirect mortality from reductions in available refugia from predation and inability to recover from dislodgement could be significant. These results highlight the importance of understanding indirect impacts of stressors on key ecological processes in order to predict ecological responses.",10.1007/s00227-013-2173-0

This study identifies issues to be considered by stakeholders in developing certification standards for channel catfish, tilapias, rainbow trout, oysters, mussels, clams, scallops, abalone, and seaweed. Common issues include land and water use, water pollution, benthic effects, effects on biodiversity use of antibiotics and other chemicals, and relationships with workers and local communities. Specific, contentious issues apply to individual species or species groups. Fish meal use in feeds will be a major concern in finfish certification. Use of groundwater removal of daily mortalities, and medicated feed in channel catfish culture should be given particular attention. Tilapia culture can introduce these species into watersheds where they have not previously occurred, resulting in serious competition with native species. Some environmentalists and consumers object to hormone treatment of tilapia to produce all male fry. Widespread use of therapeutic agents in trout culture will be a major concern. Discussions of shellfish certification should focus on water use conflicts and public health risks associated with the consumption of these organisms. The introduction of non-native species and genetic alterations with respect to oysters also will need to be addressed. Further introduction of non-native species should be a major topic in discussions of abalone and seaweed culture. The source of wild seaweed to use as food in abalone culture also will be an issue.",10.1080/10641260500326867

Foraging vent abalones actively consume the bacteria and confine their nightly feeding forays to bacterial mats surrounding the vents. The growth of abalones consuming the sulfur bacteria exceeds that of control individuals consuming microalgae and is comparable to reported growth rates of abalones consuming macroalgae.

These systems have been poorly studied in Labeo rohita (rohu). The present study characterized and investigated the role of antioxidant genes in the defence mechanisms against two types of stressors, including infection and ammonia stress. Four key genes associated with antioxidant activity-catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and CuZn superoxide dismutase were successfully cloned and sequenced. These genes were found to be expressed in different tissues and developmental stages of rohu. The expression levels of these antioxidant genes in the liver and anterior kidney tissues of rohu juveniles were modulated in response to bacterial infection (Aeromonas hydrophila), parasite infection (Argulus siamensis), poly I:C stimulation and ammonia stress. Additionally, the recombinant proteins derived from these genes exhibited significant antioxidant and antibacterial activities. These proteins also demonstrated a protective effect against A. hydrophila infection in rohu and had an immunomodulatory role. Furthermore, indirect ELISA assay systems were developed to measure these protein levels in healthy as well as A. hydrophila and ammonia-induced rohu serum.

Research on these range shifts largely focuses on understanding and predicting changes in the distribution of individual species. The ecological effects of marine range shifts on ecosystem structure and functioning, as well as human coastal communities, can be large, yet remain difficult to anticipate and manage. Here, we use qualitative modelling of system feedback to understand the cumulative impacts of multiple species shifts in south-eastern Australia, a global hotspot for ocean warming. We identify range-shifting species that can induce trophic cascades and affect ecosystem dynamics and productivity, and evaluate the potential effectiveness of alternative management interventions to mitigate these impacts. Our results suggest that the negative ecological impacts of multiple simultaneous range shifts generally add up. Thus, implementing whole-of-ecosystem management strategies and regular monitoring of range-shifting species of ecological concern are necessary to effectively intervene against undesirable consequences of marine range shifts at the regional scale. Our study illustrates how modelling system feedback with only limited qualitative information about ecosystem structure and range-shifting species can predict ecological consequences of multiple co-occurring range shifts, guide ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change and help prioritise future research and monitoring.",10.1111/gcb.13285

To analyze the transcriptome response to tributyltin of small abalone Haliotis diversicolor supertexta, a normalized cDNA library of hepatopancreas after exposure of animals to tributyltin was constructed. Three thousand and forty eight high quality ESTs were generated. After processing, a total of 2473 unigenes comprising 370 contigs and 2103 singlets were acquired. BLAST identified 1108 clones (45%) as known genes.

Abalone recruitment is related to the algal community type, with abalone shifting with growth from deeper crustose coralline algal (CCA) habitats to shallower kelp bed habitats via algal turfs. Timing of the habitat shifts is linked to ontogenetic changes in diet, from benthic diatoms to a diet dominated by macroalgae. Susceptibility to predation appears to change, concomitant with the shift from cryptic microhabitats during early-life stages to more exposed habitats during latter-life stages. Interstitial spaces between cobbles and boulders in the CCA habitat are considered to be important for reducing predation risk. The loss of CCA nursery habitat through sedimentation and macroalgal overgrowth likely negatively affects abalone recruitment. Preservation of diverse algal communities, including suitable habitats for the different abalone growth stages, is critical for successful abalone recruitment.",10.1007/s12562-017-1169-y

It participates in the host immune defense via phagocytosis, signal transduction, cell-cell communication, proliferation, and migration of immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Hence, CTSZ is also acknowledged as an acute-phase protein in host immunity. In this study, we sought to identify the CTSZ homolog from disk abalone (AbCTSZ) and characterize it at the molecular, genomic, and transcriptional levels. AbCTSZ encodes a protein with 318 amino acids and a molecular mass of 36 kDa. The structure of AbCTSZ reveals amino acid sequences that are characteristic of the signal sequence, pro-peptide, peptidase-Cl papain family cysteine protease domain, mini-loop, HIP motif, N-linked glycosylation sites, active sites, and conserved Cys residues. A pairwise comparison revealed that AbCTSZ shared the highest amino acid homology with its molluscan counterpart from Crassostrea gigas. A multiple alignment analysis revealed the conservation of functionally crucial elements of AbCTSZ, and a phylogenetic study further confirmed a proximal evolutionary relationship with its invertebrate counterparts. Further, an analysis of AbCTSZ genomic structure revealed seven exons separated by six introns, which differs from that of its vertebrate counterparts. Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) detected the transcripts of AbCTSZ in early developmental stages and in eight different tissues. Higher levels of AbCTSZ transcripts were found in trochophore, gill, and hemocytes, highlighting its importance in the early development and immunity of disk abalone. In addition, we found that viable bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes) and bacterial lipopolysaccharides significantly modulated AbCTSZ transcription. Collectively, these lines of evidences suggest that AbCTSZ plays an indispensable role in the innate immunity of disk abalone.",10.1016/j.gene.2017.07.007

This bacterium in red abalone Haliotis rufescens, black abalone Haliotis cracherodii, and yellow abalone Haliotis corrugata from California, US and Baja California, Mexico has been found to be infected by a bacteriophage. To date, there is no information on the epizootiology of CXc and its bacteriophage in natural populations of abalone; furthermore, it is unknown if the bacteriophage was also present in CXc infecting blue abalone Haliotis fulgens. The objective of this study was to determine the distribution, prevalence and intensity of CXc, as well as to determine the distribution and prevalence of the bacteriophage and to study interactions between host sex and hyperparasitism in blue abalone and yellow abalone. Tissue samples were obtained from seven localities where the commercial capture of wild abalone is carried out. Samplings were conducted throughout the 2012-2013 capture seasons and a total of 182 blue abalone and 170 yellow abalone were obtained. The prevalence and intensity of CXc and the prevalence of the bacteriophage were determined by histology. The identity of CXc was confirmed by PCR, product sequence analysis and in situ hybridization while the identity of the bacteriophage was corroborated by TEM. The prevalence of CXc infected and uninfected by the bacteriophage was 80% in blue abalone and 62% in yellow abalone. Low infection intensities were found in 86% of blue abalone and 82% of yellow abalone. Infection intensity was significantly higher in undifferentiated yellow abalone. The bacteriophage in CXc showed a prevalence of 22% and 31% in blue abalone and yellow abalone respectively. These results show that CXc and its bacteriophage are widely distributed in the peninsula of Baja California and that they are well established in natural populations of blue abalone and yellow abalone.

The winter NE monsoon and the summer SW monsoon have a significant effect on the monthly incremental growth of juvenile abalone (30-63 mm shell length, p < 0.001). The peak average growth rates, up to 7.4 (SD +/- 2.5) mm and 8.4 (SD +/- 2.5) mm per month, occurred in October and September, respectively, with minimal growth of < 1 mm occurring from March to May. The growth increases coincided with the blooming of Ulva sp. when the temperatures decreased and upwelling occurred. Growth also peaked when the kelp species Sargassum and Sargopsis were abundant. Complete growth inhibition occurred during April and May when very little algal biomass is available. The peak summer growth rates were approximately 3 times the lowest winter growth rates. A close relationship was identified between the chlorophyll-a levels and abalone growth. Increases in marine productivity are reflected in both the chlorophyll-a levels and the seasonal algal diversity, and the abundance is likely the most dominant driver of increased abalone growth along the Dhofar coast.

Overfishing was the main factor contributing to decreasing landings, and in 2004 both pink and green abalone were identified as species of concern. Translocation of adults, moving solitary abalone together to create dense aggregations, is one of the strategies that has been proposed to overcome Allee effects and to enhance spawning success and recovery. Pink (n = 35) and green (n = 113) abalone were tagged and translocated to recovery sites with preexisting pink (n = 13) and green (n = 26) abalone. Translocation and preexisting abalone were tagged and monitored to determine their long-term survival, persistence at the site, and movement at 2 islands in southern California. The mortality associated with the tagging and translocations was low (<5%) including 1 dead pink abalone and 5 dead green abalone. The density of translocated pink abalone at 2 sites remained fairly stable, decreasing slightly from 0.84 abalone/m(2) to 0.72 abalone/m(2) after 391 days and 0.56 abalone/m(2) to 0.44 abalone/m(2) after 133 days.

Pink abalone persistence was high and immigration was rare, whereas green abalone persistence was low and immigration into the sites was common. We find that pink abalone are optimal candidates for translocation given their high rate of site fidelity, but green abalone are not. Furthermore, our results demonstrate how important species-specific behaviors are to the success of translocation efforts, supporting the use of pilot studies prior to implementation of large-scale translocation recovery actions.",10.2983/35.032.0127

Despite significant financial investment and the establishment and expansion of farms around Europe, the production of a saleable end product has remained undefined. The technical barriers to producing viable juvenile abalone spat still impair growth of the industry in Ireland. Critical developments required in the industry are identified. Uptake of these developments from research remains slow due to the trial-and-error approach taken by operators. Using technologies and procedures from producing countries and implementing them into Irish culture conditions will aid the development and expansion of the industry.",10.1007/s10499-012-9584-7

However, this progression needs to be sustainable, which can potentially be achieved by the implementation of circular practices. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems promote the incorporation of circular principles. Nevertheless, the lack of harmonized definitions and standards impedes the quantification of these circular attributes. This study aims to explore the potential principles embedded in IMTA and the existing alternatives to quantify circularity. Two basic pillars (nutrient management and resource use efficiency) were identified as the most relevant circularity attributes for IMTA systems and were quantified through aquaculture-specific indicators. Bioremediation indicators, together with the efficiency indicators in terms of feed, water, energy, and infrastructure materials used, were selected to evaluate the circularity performance of four IMTA trials in three aquaculture facilities in Ireland, Brazil, and South Africa. Salmon, white shrimp, tilapia, abalone, and sea urchins were studied and cultivated together in various combinations with several low-trophic species in these IMTA trials to evaluate the improvement in circularity compared with corresponding monoculture conditions. The results showed an increase in circularity of up to 90% in terms of water recirculation, as well as bioremediation, which was improved by 80%-90%, providing evidence for the potential role of IMTA in the circularity transition.",10.3390/fishes9050165

Over the biologically relevant range of temperatures (9-24 degreesC), protease activity increased continuously with activity at 24 degreesC being 75% higher than activity at 9 degreesC. Protease digestion was relatively uniform in gut extracts from sections containing gut contents. Digestion thus appears to be significantly extracellular (in the lumen of the gut).

In this study, 248 genomes of 49 Shewanella species were analysed as well as 33 environmental isolates belonging to 10 Shewanella species. The presence of the qnrA gene was detected in 22.9% of the genomes and 15.2% of the isolates. The gene was more often detected in Shewanella algae, but was also detected in Shewanella carassii, Shewanella chilikensis, Shewanella haliotis and Shewanella indica. The identified genes encoded the previously described variants QnrA3 (in 22 genomes of one species), QnrA2 (eight genomes and three species), QnrA1 (six genomes and two species), QnrA7 (five genomes and two species), QnrA10 (two genomes of one species) and QnrA4 (one genome). In addition, 11 novel variants with 3 to 7 amino acid substitutions were identified (in 13 genomes and one environmental isolate). The presence of this gene appears to be species-specific although within some species several variants were detected. The study presents a previously unknown diversity of qnrA in Shewanella, highlighting the role of this genus as progenitor and reservoir of these genes.

Abalone, broadcast-spawning marine snails associated with shallow rocky habitats, have experienced widespread declines, and all seven North American species are threatened. We investigated the connectivity and population genomics of pinto/northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana), the widest-ranging of abalone species. We employed reduced representation sequencing (RADseq) to generate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, assessing population connectivity and potential adaptive variation at 12 locations across the full range from Alaska to Mexico. Despite depleted populations, our analysis of over 6000 SNPs across nearly 300 individuals revealed that pinto abalone maintains a high genetic diversity with no evidence of a genetic bottleneck. Neutral population structure and isolation by distance were extremely weak, indicating panmixia across the species' range (global FST = 0.0021). Phylogenetic analysis, principal components analysis, and unsupervised clustering methods all supported a single genetic population. However, slight population differentiation was noted in the Salish Sea and Inside Passage regions, with evidence for higher barriers to dispersal relative to outer coastal areas. This north-central region may also represent the species' ancestral range based on relatively low population-specific FST values; the northern and southern extremes of the range likely represent range expansions. Outlier analysis did not identify consensus loci implicated in adaptive variation, suggesting limited adaptive differentiation. Our study sheds light on the evolutionary history and contemporary gene flow of this threatened species, providing key insights for conservation strategies, particularly in sourcing broodstock for ongoing restoration efforts.",10.1111/eva.70040

Thus, metamorphosis must be fueled by either endogenous reserves or a nonparticulate food source such as dissolved organic material (DOM) in seawater, The metabolic rates (measured as oxygen consumption) of abalone larvae were found to increase by an average of 3- to 5-fold from the larva to early juvenile stage, The total cost of development from embryo to juvenile measured for three cultures ranged from 41.6 mJ to 55.0 mJ. Meeting this cost would require 1.3 to 1.7 mu g of biomass (ash-free dry mass), which is similar to the initial biomass of the spawned oocyte at 1.36 +/- 0.04 mu g (mean of four cultures). However, there was no net loss of biomass during development from the oocyte to the juvenile, The uptake of alanine alanine and glucose from seawater by larvae and juveniles could provide one-third of the organic material required po supply metabolism, even if the transporters were only operating at 20% of their maximum capacity throughout development, For larvae undergoing metamorphosis (between 6- and 9-days-old) the proportion of total metabolic demand supplied using aerobically catabolized biomass was only 39%. The higher metabolic rates of metamorphosis are met only in part by consuming stored endogenous reserves. Concomitant with an increase in mass-specific metabolic rate during metamorphosis, the maximal capacity (J(max)) for the transport of dissolved alanine from seawater increased 3-fold, from 61.2 +/- 1.9 (SE) to 182.0 +/- 49 pmol alanine individual(-1) h(-1), The majority (range: 61% to 100%) Of the energy requirements of larval and early juvenile development of H. rufescens could be supplied by input of DOM from the environment, Measurements of transport rates of amino acids and sugars by these animals, and calculations of the energy input from these substrates, indicate that the cumulative transport of DOM from seawater during development to the early juvenile stage could supply an amount of energy equivalent to the initial maternal endowment of energy reserves to the oocyte of this lecithotrophic species.",10.2307/1543013

This study used microelectrodes to investigate the influence of water velocity and diatom morphology on dissolved oxygen and pH in the DBL. Decreasing water velocity increased the thickness of the DBL, thereby increasing the amplitude of changes in oxygen concentration. Over a film of the prostrate diatom Nitzschia ovalis Arnot, DBL thickness averaged 71, 139, 177, and 406 mu m at water velocities of 78, 15, 7, and 1 mm s(-1) respectively. Corresponding oxygen concentrations at the biofilm surface under moderate light (75 mu E m(-2) s(-1)) and temperature (15 degrees C) averaged 111%, 120%, 125%, and 151 % of air saturation respectively, at the four velocities. The presence of a 1-mm tall diatom canopy (Achnanthes longipes Agardh) over a Nitzschia ovalis film thickened the DBL by 3-fold at 1 mm s(-1) and 6-fold at similar to 80 mm s(-1). The thickened DBL and higher diatom biomass generated extreme conditions at the biofilm surface. Dissolved oxygen concentrations as high as 440% of air saturation, and pH Lis high as 9.8 were recorded beneath the canopy in moderate light (105 mu E m(-2) s(-1)) and temperature (15 degrees C) at a water velocity of 1 mm s(-1). Changes during darkness were less extreme, with 53% oxygen saturation and pH 7.7 the minima recorded. These measurements demonstrate the extreme water chemistry that can develop in the microhabitat of postlarval abalone. The changes will be amplified by the presence of filamentous diatoms, by increased light intensity, and by lack of water movement. Standard aeration will greatly reduce the extremes experienced by postlarvae by generating water movement sufficient to thin the DBL.",10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[745:EOWVAB]2.0.CO;2

Three methods of protein quantification were used: the Bradford method, crude protein, and specific nitrogen to protein (N-Prot) conversion factors, and results were compared to each other. The results showed that values obtained with the traditional conversion factor of 6.25 were on average higher than Bradford values by factors of 64.1 % in U. capensis, 77.1 % in U. rigida and 58.9 % in U. lactuca. This pattern is in line with other published work on seaweed and microalgae. Analyses of amino acid composition showed that aspartic acid was the most abundant amino acid and that these species were also rich in glycine and alanine but poor in histidine, methionine and cysteine.

Consequently, the implementation of more osmosis reverse desalination plants in central-northern Chile has been promoted, but the consequences of brine discharges on local organisms are largely unknown. The Chilean abalone (Concholepas concholepas) represent the most economically important marine resource exploited along the Chilean coast. In this study, newly hatched larvae of C. concholepas were used to investigate the effects of brine discharges of a reverse osmosis desalination plant on coastal organisms. Under laboratory conditions, larvae were exposed to various dilutions of a brine to assess the consequences on lethal (survival) and sublethal (swimming performance and metabolism) traits. The results indicated that brine discharges had no effects on larval survival. However, undiluted brines (ca. 56 PSU) and salinities above 38 PSU led to increased metabolic rates and a reduction in the swimming performance of the larvae. We suggest mitigating the negative effects of brines on newly hatched C. concholepas larvae by situating discharge points in highly hydrodynamic zones or as far as possible from mating and larval hatching areas. Additionally, we recommended using diffusers to enhance mixing and dilute brine to sub -lethal levels (below 48 PSU).",10.1016/j.desal.2024.117579

The nitrogen stable isotope ratio of the reared individuals was significantly higher than that of the wild individuals, and the trophic level (3.23) of the wild D. setosum indicated a carnivorous diet (higher consumers).

However, the intensity of predation can vary dramatically among habitats. The habitat can directly affect the interaction between predator and prey; but also, by determining the distributions of predators and prey, the habitat can mediate the likelihood of a predatory encounter. Here, we used laboratory experiments to identify the likely predators of juvenile abalone Haliotis iris on temperate reefs in central New Zealand. Predator performance in the laboratory was assessed in conditions without prey refuge, in simulated juvenile habitat as well as in the presence of alternate prey. We then used surveys to compare the abundance of predators and juvenile abalone to explore if negative associations between predator and prey in the laboratory manifest in the field. Last, we manipulated algal habitat complexity at 2 depths and quantified the effect of predator exclusion on juvenile abalone survival in the field. We found that starfish were the likely predators of juvenile H. iris in our study system. Furthermore, predation of juvenile abalone by starfish was lowest in habitats with the greatest structural complexity, and there is evidence that predation by starfish in cobble habitats was size-dependent. Overall, we found that habitat variability mediates predation on juvenile abalone by determining the likelihood of an encounter between predator and prey.",10.3354/meps10380

Levels of endogenous catecholamines increase 6 to 9 days after fertilization, when larvae become competent for metamorphosis. Six- to nine-day larvae, treated with the catecholamine precursor L-DOPA (0.01 mM for 0.5 h), were assayed for metamorphosis in response to coral inducer and for catecholamine content by high-performance liquid chromatography. L-DOPA treatment caused 20- to 50-fold increases in dopamine, with proportionally greater increases in younger larvae, so that L-DOPA-treated larvae of all ages contained similar levels of dopamine. A much smaller (about twofold) increase in norepinephrine occurred in all larvae. The treatment significantly potentiated the frequency of metamorphosis of 7- to 9-d larvae at low concentrations of inducer. In addition, L-DOPA treatment at 9 d increased aldehyde-induced fluorescence in cells that were also labeled in the controls, and revealed additional cells. However, all labeled cells were consistent with the locations of cells showing tyrosine-hydroxylase-like immunoreactivity. Catecholamines are likely to modulate metamorphosis in P. sibogae, but rising levels of catecholamines around the time of competence are insufficient alone to account for sensitivity to inducer in competent larvae.",10.2307/1542688

The loco is present along the coast of Chile, in the Archipelago of Juan Fernandez and in southern and central Peril, and its range of distribution spans over 5,000 kin of intertidal and shallow subtidal reefs. In Chile, the loco is a traditional food resource and has been heavily exploited since the early Holocene by intertidal food-gathers and free divers, and since the 1950s; 60s by a small-scale artisan fleet of hookah-divers. In Chile, since the mid-1970s, the species has been mainly exported (foot-meat) to Asian markets, and between 1976 and 1980 market demands acted as a major driving force behind overexploitation of the loco. Since the 1990s, its fishery moved from an open access regime to a comanagement regulated policy based on territorial user rights for fisheries (TURF) and reproductive fishery bans. The loco, as an iconic species, played a key role in the implementation of TURF. In Peru, the loco fishery operates under a reproductive ban fishery regime and its export started in the late 1990s. In Chile, the loco is by far the most intensely studied of all exploited shellfishes in terms of evolution, paleobiogeography, biogeography, life history, behavior. physiology, ecology. genetics, and fishery. Moreover, the loco has been used as a biological model to study responses to global stressors such as ocean warming and acidification. During the past 20 y, several laboratory experimental attempts have been made to advance experimental, pilot, and commercial aquaculture of the loco. Nevertheless, the available information shows that no reliable and repeatable pilot or massive aquaculture protocols have yet succeeded. In this study, the extensive field and laboratory information for the most relevant life history phases of the loco, such as reproduction, mating, brood-stock holding, egg capsule deposition, larval posthatching, growing to competence, larval feeding, settlement and metamorphosis to juvenile stages, and pilot growing experiences to adult sizes are reviewed. In light of the available information, the most critical aquaculture bottlenecks are identified. Among them, the existence, from hatching to competence, of a long larval planktonic phase of about 3-4 mo, and the existence of cannibalism during postsettlement confined laboratory conditions are highlighted. Moreover. key aspects of the larval rearing of the loco. such as densities, field and laboratory food items, and temperatures are reported. The field collection of (1) competent larvae of locos in inshore coastal plankton; (2) new settlers from rocky shores; and (3) new settlers from fishery-discarded conspecific shells are also discussed. The collection of competent larvae was followed by laboratory induction to settlement and by two consecutive postsettlement rearing/growing phases (laboratory and field conditions) to overcome difficulties associated with the long larval phase and to speed up the time required to reach trading sizes. Furthermore, collection of new settlers was followed by rearing experiments under both laboratory and field conditions. The need of high demands of live prey (mainly mussels) during the laboratory rearing of the early benthic stages of loco is discussed, emphasizing that to implement ecologically sustainable aquaculture practices, parallel aquaculture of the appropriated prey is needed. A review of what is already known regarding the biology of C. concholepas is provided along with progress and pit-falls for the aquaculture of this species. The practicality for its aquaculture and the main challenges ahead are also discussed.",10.2983/035.037.0520

Such marks are required to 'time stamp' the shells and thus determine whether shell layers are deposited regularly enough to be used to age abalone. The stains used were: oxytetracycline and tetracycline at 300-1000 mg L(-1); calcein at 10-120 mg L(-1); alizarin red S at 10-60 mg L(-1); and xylenol orange at 20-100 mg L(-1). Immersion times were 12, 24 and 48 h. Mortality rates were low in all treatments, and clearly discernible marks were produced when abalone were immersed for 24 and 48 h at high concentrations in all the stains. Three problems were encountered when tetracyclines were employed: (i) the solutions were acidic, so the pH had to be adjusted with NaOH to prevent mortality; (ii) there was excessive foaming of the solutions; and (iii) a natural fluorescence in the shells closely resembled that of the tetracyclines. Problems also arose in assessing alizarin red and xylenol orange because they have long emission wavelengths, so that simultaneously viewing natural layers on the sections is difficult, Calcein, although expensive, was the most effective, as at high concentrations it consistently produced bright, extensive marks. The success of marking appeared to depend on the growth rate of the abalone, as feeding before staining increased the intensity of marks, and marking varied between batches of abalone collected at different times.",10.1071/MF9950599

Out of the range of sea otters, live abalones were over twice as large and were numerous outside crevices (when protected from human predation). At the study site within their range, sea otters selected abalones larger than were proportionately available in crevices, and they broke many large shells with stone tools. An average of 55 freshly produced empty abalone shells, equivalent to .apprxeq. 20% of the crevice population of live abalones, were found each month in the study area over a 12-mo. period. Indirect calculations of feeding rates of sea otters also indicated a high production rate of abalones, as did observations of abalones in mapped crevices.

Weight-standardized rates (ingestion, assimilation, respiration, ammonia excretion, and fecal excretion) of small (juvenile), medium (mature), and large (mature) sea cucumbers were measured and energy budgets constructed to quantify their growth rates when offered three different diets at 14, 16, and 18 C. Three types of diet were offered: uneaten abalone food (diet A) and two types of abalone feces, one where abalone were fed 50% Macrocystis pyrifera and 50% Undaria pinnatifida macroalgae (diet B) and the other where abalone were fed 25% M. pyrifera, 25% U. pinnatifida, and 50% Adam & Amos Abalone Food, where the latter is an industry standard diet (diet C). The organic contents of the diets were much higher than natural sediments and varied such that diet A (76.40%) > diet B (54.50%) > diet C (37.00%). Diet had a significant effect on S. mollis ingestion rates, assimilation efficiencies, and consequently energy budgets and growth rates. Greater quantities of organic matter (OM) from diet A and diet B were ingested and assimilated by the sea cucumbers compared with the OM in diet C. The energy budgets indicated that after taking routine metabolism into account, all sizes of sea cucumbers had energy to allocate to growth when offered diet A and diet B, but only juveniles had energy to allocate to growth when offered diet C. Fecal excretion rates when offered diet A and diet C at 14 C were greater than those at 18 C, but neither was significantly different from that at 16 C. Ammonia excretion rates increased nonlinearly with temperature for small and medium sea cucumbers but not for large sea cucumbers. Weight-standardized respiration rates increased with temperature and unexpectedly with animal size, which may have been because of the narrow weight range of test animals biasing the results. These results suggest that industry standard type abalone waste lacks sufficient energy to meet the metabolic requirements of mature sea cucumbers but that growing juveniles on these wastes appears to be feasible and warrants further investigation.",10.1111/j.1749-7345.2009.00239.x

The culture of Caulerpa lentillifera as a biofilter did not work in the open sea cultivation system using baskets. Monthly measurements of shell length, width and body weight of the cultured abalones, together with in situ measurements of physicochemical parameters to assess any changes in water quality, mainly nitrate, nitrite, ammonia and phosphate, were conducted over a year period from February 2013 to January 2014 in three designated stations (Abalone, Seaweed and Control Stations) at three different depths (surface, middle and bottom). Cage culture of abalone side by side with seaweeds in the open sea did not result in any significant water quality disturbance in the area at least not in the current volume of caged abalones being used. Of the four inorganic compounds monitored in the field, nitrate and ammonia in the Seaweed Station were shown to have relatively lower year-round average values when compared with the Abalone Station, although in the case of nitrate, it was higher in the Control Station compared with the abalone and Seaweed Stations. Although this difference was not significant, it shows the red seaweeds, G. heteroclada and E. denticulatum, to be functioning as a natural filter for these two nutrients. In contrast, nitrite, and phosphate concentrations were not reduced indicating that the seaweeds were not effective biofilter for these two nutrients. The two-month old hatchery-bred donkey's ear abalones can grow to a size of 53.8 x 28.2 mm (L x W) and body weight of 37.8 g after a period of 12 months. Any expansion of the farm into a much larger commercial-scale farm will have to be complimented with seaweeds stocked around it if only to mitigate possible build-up of excess inorganic wastes to serve as both a natural filter and as a source of natural feed. The potential use of an organic extractive species has to be further studied under farm condition to achieve its full potential as an IMTA species. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Since then there have been considerable changes. There are three main uses of kelp (mostly Ecklonia maxima, with some Laminaria pallida) in South Africa. The collection of wash-up for drying and exporting for alginate extraction has drastically reduced to very small amounts in recent years. The boat harvest of fresh kelp for abalone feed in land-based farms has reached a plateau of between 4000 and 5000 t fresh per annum. The diver harvest of E. maxima for agricultural liquid plant growth enhancer shows a constant increase over several years, is still growing, and is currently over 3000 t fresh per annum. The small intertidal collection of Gelidium pristoides as export for agar production has maintained a small, sustainable production of around 100 t dry for many years. Former Gracilaria industries in sheltered bays in both South Africa and Namibia have collapsed, and there is currently no commercial collection. There was commercial raft aquaculture production of Gracilaria in Luderitz Bay, Namibia for a number of years, but this is no longer practised. Currently, the only commercial seaweed use in Namibia is of L. pallida. Annually, ca. 150 t of fresh wash-up is collected, in Luderitz, to be used as feed in land-based abalone aquaculture. There are a number of small start-up companies experimenting with seaweed products for cosmetics and nutritional products in both countries, some involving species of Ulva and Porphyra. The former species is a major aquaculture product, with around 2000 t fresh yr(-1) being produced in integrated land-based systems with abalone.",10.1515/bot-2019-0074

Three replicates of two tanks rearing fish at a density of 24 kg/m(3) were used to measure OC at 34 ppt working as open respirometers in a recirculating system under farm-like conditions. The fish were fed commercial dry pelleted feeds at a ratio of 1% of total biomass. Oxygen consumption rates were determined by mass balance calculations. The OC increased from 1.6 to 2.4g O-2/kg fish/day as temperature increased from 14 to 18 degrees C. The determination of oxygen consumption by palm fish in farm-like conditions provides valuable information on the oxygen requirement of these fish in an aquacultural setting. This bioengineering information can be used for designing and sizing a rearing facility for the intensive culture of palm fish. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The full length cDNA of heat shock transcriptional factor 1 (HdHSF1), heat shock factor binding protein 1(HSBP1), and heat shock protein 90 (HdHSP90) are 1548 bp, 809 bp, and 2592 bp respectively, encoding a protein of 515 aa, 75 aa, and 728 aa respectively. Real time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that these three genes are constitutively expressed in 7 selected tissues. The expression level of HdHSF1 in gills was higher than that in other tissues (p < 0.05). The highest expression level of HdHSBP1 was detected in hemocytes. The highest expression level of HdHSP90 was in the digestive tract and colleterial gland. The HdHSF1 expression level in the gills was up-regulated significantly (p < 0.05) after thermal stress and hypoxia exposure respectively. On the contrary, HdHSBP1 was down-regulated both in gills and hemocytes after thermal stress and the same as in gills after hypoxia stress. HdHSP90 expression level was also up-regulated in gills and hemocytes after both thermal and hypoxia stresses. These results indicated that these three heat shock responsive genes play important roles in response to thermal and hypoxia stress. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The cephalic and epipodial tentacles are essentially sensory organs with similar general structure. In a mature adult (about 16 mo-old), the cephalic tentacle measures about 3.77 cm in length and 0.14 cm in diameter, whereas the epipodial tentacle measures about 9.27 mm in length and 0.59 mm in diameter. In cross sections, each tentacle has a bundle of nerve fiber forming the core Structure. surrounded by a thick layer of circular muscle, which also branches into radially oriented fibers. These fibers are interlaced with thick paraxially orientated fibers; together they account for the size and mobility of the tentacles. The surface of both types of tentacles can be divided into three parts: the basal part exhibits slight corrugation consisting of small folds alternated with grooves, the middle part has numerous short hillock-shaped papillae, and the top part has a very high concentration of cone-shaped papillae. Each papilla comprises a group of densely stained ciliated neuroepithelial cells, surrounded by lightly stained supporting epithelial cells bearing microvilli. Gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) was found, by immunohistochemistry, to be highly concentrated in the neuroepithelial cells.

Eroded shell surfaces, reduced growth rates, and altered biochemical composition and energy metabolism were found in abalone cultured in acidified conditions. Glycogen contents and crude lipid contents were significantly higher in the muscle of abalone from the control treatments than in those from the pH 7.7 treatment, indicating that allocation of tissue energy storage was altered by chronic acidification. The ratio of the oxygen consumption rate to the ammonia excretion rate (O:N ratio) of individuals cultured at two acidified treatments decreased significantly compared with the controls, suggesting a decreased use of body lipid and carbohydrates as a metabolic substrate under chronic acidified conditions. Chronic acidification had detrimental effects on the physiological activity of the Pacific abalone; however, the ability to acclimate varied among individuals. A minority of tested animals incubated at acidified conditions exhibited undiminished performance.

In the present study, the effects of photoperiod (0 L:24 D, 6 L:18 D, 12 L:12 D, 18 L:6 D, and 24 L:0 D) on mortality, growth performance, and lipid metabolism of juvenile mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) were studied with an 8-week experiment. The results showed that the highest final weight of crabs was observed in the 18 L:6 D (0.48 +/- 0.08 g), which was significantly higher than 0 L:24 D (0.22 +/- 0.03 g) and 6 L:18 D (0.28 +/- 0.04 g) (P < 0.05). In addition, the specific growth rate (SGR) of crabs reared at 12 L:12 D (natural photoperiod) (5.83 +/- 0.26% day- 1) and 18 L:6 D (6.28 +/- 0.27% day- 1) were significantly higher than 0 L:24 D (4.70 +/- 0.42% day- 1), 6 L:18 D (5.16 +/- 0.22% day- 1) and 24 L:0 D (5.60 +/- 0.23% day- 1) (P < 0.05). The survival rate of the natural photoperiod group was significantly higher than 18 L:6 D group (69.23 +/- 6.28% vs 35.90 +/- 3.63%) (P < 0.05), but no significant difference between 0 L:24 D (58.97 +/- 3.63%), 6 L:18D (66.67 +/- 7.25%) and 24 L:0 D (58.97 +/- 7.25%) groups was observed (P > 0.05).

In addition, compared with natural photoperiod, crabs reared under constant darkness showed significantly higher TG and TC content (P < 0.05). Moreover, in constant darkness, lipogenesisrelated genes such as fatty acid synthase (fas), sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (srebp-1), and acetylCoA carboxylase (acc) of the crab were up-regulated, and lipolysis-related genes as carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (cpt-1), Acyl-CoA oxidase-3 (aco-3) were significantly down-regulated (P < 0.05). Besides, fatty acid binding protein (fabp) was also up-regulated in crabs reared under constant darkness.

CXc can be infected by a bacteriophage (pCXc), and both phage-infected and non-phage-infected CXc can coexist with a presumable different species of RLO tentatively named stippled Rickettsiales-like organism (ST-RLO). Currently, the taxonomic affiliation of the ST-RLO is unknown, and no studies have been conducted to determine its presence in infected abalones in the Peninsula of Baja California, Mexico. To determine whether the ST-RLO is a histological variant of CXc or a new species of RLO, we performed histology and species-specific in situ hybridization (ISH) for CXc and pCXc in red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, infected with CXc and hyperparasitized by pCXc, which also showed the presence of the ST-RLO. Additionally, a histological analysis of the presence of all of these RLOs from 2008 to 2019 from an aquaculture facility was performed. The results showed that all STRLOs were negative by ISH for CXc and pCXc, suggesting that the ST-RLO is a different species of bacterium and that it is not susceptible to infection by pCXc. Histologically similar alterations to those produced by CXc in the post esophagus were observed. The three RLOs regularly coexist in all the infected abalones, and there is a relatively constant proportion of each kind of RLO over time, suggesting that equilibrium is reached during coexistence; the largest percentage corresponded to CXc non phage infected (81%), followed by CXc infected by pCXc (16%) and the ST-RLO (3%). In all cases, the ST-RLO infection remained at a subclinical level making it difficult to determine if it acts as pathogen or as a commensal. Therefore, the genetic characterization of the STRLO and pathogenicity studies are needed to further elucidate the role of this new RLO in the development of of WS in abalone species of North America.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.736026

Abalone fisheries are mainly seen in Wando on the south coast of Korea, where seaweed aquaculture has been majorly conducted. Mass mortality of abalone spats is considered a major problem in abalone fisheries and is caused by changes in environmental factors and food availability (including availability of benthic diatoms). However, it is difficult to supply sufficient quantities of benthic diatoms to post-larvae abalone. Therefore, we explored the development of growth-promoting substances for diatoms Navicula sp. and experimentally mixed several substances to enhance the growth of diatoms. In this study, we used alginic acid, fucoidan, Scytosiphon lomentaria, Ecklonia cava, Ecklonia cava processing byproduct (i.e., Ecklonia cava-boiled extracts, EBE), and Porphyra tenera. In addition, EBE, phosphate fertilizer (PF), nitrogenous manure (NM), and sodium silicate (SS) were mixed to determine the optimal composition of growth substances. The growth of diatoms significantly increased under EBE exposure, compared with other substances. During this study, attempts were made to identify the optimal composition of mixtures of PF, NM, and SS with that of EBE (1:1:1:1).

Higher values were obtained at low densities (<1% of embryos bottom-coverage and <1 larvae/ml), except for the growth of larvae, which was similar among treatments. Higher larval survival was recorded using the static culture system, and higher percent of post-larvae recovered was associated with lower density of crawling veliger (0.2 and 0.1/ml), while its higher growth rate was related to the use of biofilms with conspecific mucus and low water-flow (50%/h).

The Of-mMnSOD protein portrayed distinct MnSOD family features including signature motifs, metal association sites and the typical active site topology. It was also predicted to be localized in mitochondrial matrix. The Of-mMnSOD had a quinquepartite genome organization encompassing five exons interrupted by four introns. Comparison of its sequence and gene structure with that of other lineages emphasized its strong conservation among different vertebrates. The Of-mMnSOD was ubiquitously transcribed in different rock bream tissues with higher levels in blood cells and metabolically active tissues. Transcription of Of-mMnSOD was kinetically modulated in response to investigational challenges using mitogens (lipopolysaccharide and poly I:C) and live-pathogens (Edwardsiella tarda and rock bream irido virus) in blood cells and liver tissue. The purified recombinant Of-mMnSOD possessed potential antioxidant capacity and actively survived over a range of pH (7.5-11) and temperature (15-40 degrees C) conditions.

We elucidate the role of the sediment reduction-oxidation (redox) regime in structuring benthic bacterial communities, having direct implications for bioremediation potential and deposit-feeder nutrition. The sea cucumber Holothuria scabra was cultured on sediments under contrasting redox regimes; fully oxygenated (oxic) and redox stratified (oxic-anoxic). Taxonomically, metabolically and functionally distinct bacterial communities developed between the redox treatments with the oxic treatment supporting the greater diversity; redox regime and dissolved oxygen levels were the main environmental drivers. Oxic sediments were colonised by nitrifying bacteria with the potential to remediate nitrogenous wastes. Percolation of oxygenated water prevented the proliferation of anaerobic sulphate-reducing bacteria, which were prevalent in the oxic-anoxic sediments. At the predictive functional level, bacteria within the oxic treatment were enriched with genes associated with xenobiotics metabolism. Oxic sediments showed the greater bioremediation potential; however, the oxic-anoxic sediments supported a greater sea cucumber biomass. Overall, the results indicate that bacterial communities present in fully oxic sediments may enhance the metabolic capacity and bioremediation potential of deposit-feeder microbial systems.

The study was conducted for 16 weeks and was made of four treatments and four replicates; abalone cocultured with sea cucumber (low density-27: 1 g [abalone (ab): sea cucumber (sc)]) with tanks cleaned once a week (L1); abalone cocultured with sea cucumber (low density) with tanks cleaned twice a week (L2); abalone cocultured with sea cucumber (high density-15:1 g [ab:sc]) with tanks cleaned once a week (H1) and abalone cocultured with sea cucumber (high density) with tanks cleaned twice a week (H2).

This study has shown that in an abalone-sea cucumber IMTA system, the stocking density of sea cucumber and the frequency at which tanks are cleaned influence abalone growth and bioremediation of the rearing water. Our result suggests H1 as the best density (ab:sc) and cleaning frequency. The tank cleaning frequency alone affects the tank sludge quality; tanks need not be washed too frequently as, in addition to causing animal stress, cleaning markedly increased carbon and nitrogen level of tank sludge.

The larvae was exposed to different pCO(2) conditions; constant (450, 800, or 1200 mu atm in the first experiment (Exp. I), 450 or 780 mu atm in the second experiment (Exp. II)] or diurnally fluctuating pCO(2) (800 +/- 400 or 1200 +/- 400 mu atm in Exp. I, 450 +/- 80, 780 +/- 200 or 780 +/- 400 mu atm in Exp. II). Mortality, malformation rates or shell length of larval abalone were not significantly different among the 450, 800, and 800 +/- 400 mu atm pCO(2) treatments. Meanwhile, significantly higher malformation rates and smaller shells were detected in the 1200 and 1200 +/- 400 mu atm pCO(2) treatments than in the 450 mu atm pCO(2) treatment. The negative impacts were greater in the 1200 +/- 400 mu atm than in the 1200 mu atm. Shell length and malformation rate of larval abalone were related with aragonite saturation state (Omega-aragonite) in experimental seawater, and greatly changed around 1.1 of Omega-aragonite which corresponded to 1000-1300 mu atm pCO(2). These results indicate that there is a pCO(2) threshold associated with Omega-aragonite in the seawater, and that pCO(2) fluctuations produce additional negative impacts on abalone when above the threshold. Clear relationships were detected between abalone fitness and the integrated pCO(2) value over the threshold, indicating that the effects of OA on development and shell formation of larval abalone can be determined by intensity and time of exposure to pCO(2) over the threshold.",10.1016/j.marenvres.2017.12.015

However, in addition to this principal role, they can also function in multiple host defense processes, including cell phagocytosis and hydrolysis of peptidoglycans (PGNs). In this study, a novel invertebrate short-type PGRP was identified in disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) designated as AbPGRP. The complete coding sequence of AbPGRP was 534 bp, encoding a 178-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 20 kDa. The AbPGRP gene had a bipartite arrangement consisting of two exons separated by a single intron. Homology analysis revealed that AbPGRP shares conserved features, including amino acid residues critical for substrate and ion binding as well as for its amidase activity, with homologs of other species. Phylogenetic analysis of AbPGRP revealed that it likely evolved from a common ancestor of invertebrates, having significant homology with other molluscan PGRPs. Recombinant AbPGRP exhibited detectable, dose-dependent PGN-hydrolyzing activity with the presence of Zn2+, and strong antibacterial activity against Vibrio tapetis, consistent with the functional properties previously reported for PGRPs in other mollusks. Moreover, AbPGRP transcription was induced upon treatment of healthy abalones with bacterial peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide, although the expression profiles differed with treatment, suggesting a capacity for discriminating between bacterial pathogens through molecular pattern recognition. Collectively, the findings of this study indicate that AbPGRP is a true homolog of invertebrate PGRPs and likely plays an indispensable role in host immunity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Survival of postlarval abalone after settlement was monitored for 30 days to quantify the effect of delayed metamorphosis on the subsequent survival of benthic juvenile abalone. After exposure to live coralline algae, an average of 85% of the larvae metamorphosed and settled the following day. The number of settled postlarvae increased gradually the longer the settling cue was withheld. Postsettlement juveniles were raised in individual containers on mixed diatoms for up to 34 days. Red abalone larvae remained competent to settle 32 days after fertilization. Larvae that metamorphosed from day 4 through day 19 had longer survival during the next 30 days (average, 19%) than those presented with a settling cue from day 20 to day 32 (average, 8%). Statistical analysis using a threshold cut point indicated that the 20-day threshold marked a significant change in subsequent postlarval survival. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the 20-day cut point predicted high or low future survival of postmetamorphic abalone 73.4% of the time.

Following acclimation to clean seawater, three abalones were separately exposed to a 6-h sublethal concentration of PCP (1.2 mg l-1) until the spectral resonance for inorganic monophosphate (P(i)) was half-height to that of phosphoarginine (PA); the endpoint assured that all individuals were metabolically equivalent at the start of air exposure. They were exposed to clean seawater for 2 h to allow the effects from PCP to stabilize, then air for 45 min, and finally clean seawater for 15 h to check recovery. The effects of PCP in foot muscle included a decrease in the concentrations of PA and adenosine triphosphate ([PA] and [ATP], respectively), an increase in P(i), and a decrease in intracellular pH (pH(i)). Upon air exposure, [PA] and pH(i) rapidly declined further, [P(i)] increased, and [ATP] did not change; the magnitudes were similar to those from emergence alone. After resubmergence, both [PA] and [P(i)] recovered rapidly from the effects of hypoxia, but slowly from those of PCP. While pH(i) initially declined further, both [ATP] and pH(i) recovered to near-initial levels after 15 h. In general, the metabolic effects of hypoxia did not change upon pretreatment with PCP; the biochemical interaction of the two factors was additive. Another three abalones were separately exposed to PCP at an environmentally relevant concentration of 120-mu-g l-1 for 6 h, air for 1 h, then the same PCP concentration for 2.5 h to check recovery. At the lower concentration, PCP produced no discernable effects, and those of hypoxia were similar to those without PCP. Since PCP produced no additional effects with or without hypoxia, it does not significantly impact red abalones at currently measured environmental concentrations.

International prices are attractive enough to motivate the development of an important body of research to bring the catch to commercial size under controlled conditions. In this study, we analyze whether the fattening of loco from the seed stage (between 2 and 3 cm of peristomal length) up to commercial size is economically attractive for a private investor. The results of this model, composed by biological, technological and economic submodels, shows that under current conditions cultivation is not convenient Net Present Value (NPV) = -198,179 US$ on t = 1,400, the day where the maximum biomass is reached). The negative result is explained by the high operational costs (mainly wages) and high initial investments requirements (mainly plastic boxes to house the C. concholepas). Interestingly, the model shows that feeding costs are comparatively low. At t = 1400, the accumulated disbursements for investments (US$92,209) are lower than those for the operating costs (US$299,486) and represent only 24% of the total accumulated disbursements. The latter shows that the project is not profitable due to the high operating costs other than the feed. The sensitivity analysis shows that would be required a 30-fold increase in the current biomass selling price for a positive NPV. In the future, this project would benefit if more efficient forms of production are developed, especially reducing the burden due to workers' compensation.",10.3856/vo146-issue5-fulltext-4

Histological examination of affected scallops in southern Hokkaido typically revealed intense host responses: hemocyte infiltration, an abundance of necrotic hemocytes, lysis of muscle fibers and in some instances melanin deposits when the lesions occurred adjacent to the shell. Microbiota analysis showed that Francisella halioticida was dominant in the lesions, and in situ hybridization using F. halioticida specific probes also confirmed the presence of this bacterium within the lesions. A F. halioticida specific PCR assay detected this bacterium in the majority of scallop lesions tested. Subsequently, three bacterial isolates were obtained from scallop lesions on modified Eugon agar supplemented with antibiotics, and these bacterial isolates were found to be F. halioticida by 16S rRNA and rpoB gene sequences. These results suggest that infection with F. halioticida is the most likely cause of the adductor muscle lesions observed in Yesso scallops. Field surveys conducted in 2017 of scallops cultured in southern Hokkaido showed that the presence of adductor muscle lesions putatively caused by F. halioticida was significantly related to mortalities and poor growth of scallops.",10.3147/jsfp.53.78

In this study, a quantitative analysis was performed on the motion behaviour characteristics of abalones exposed to different light cycles (0 L:24D, 12 L:12D, 24 L:0D) using infrared camera and behavioural analysis software. A preliminary analysis of the intrinsic correlations between melatonin secretion and abalone behaviour rhythms was also conducted. The results showed that the cumulative moving distance and duration of movement for abalone in the 0 L:24D group were significantly higher than those in the 12 L:12D and 24 L:0D groups (P < 0.05). The mean and maximum moving velocities of abalones in the 12 L:12D group were significantly higher than those in the 0 L:24D group (P < 0.05). The maximum cumulative moving distance and duration of movement for abalone in the 12 L:12D and 24 L:0D groups occurred between 00:00-03:00. In the 0 L:24D group, peak cumulative moving distance and duration movement were recorded between 00:00-03:00 and 15:00-18:00. According to the results of cosine analysis, melatonin content and expression levels of aralkylamine N-acetyl transferase (AANAT) and N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) in the 12 L:12D and 24 L:0D groups showed significant circadian cosine rhythms (P < 0.05) and tended to be higher during the day and lower at night.

At 3- to 4-mo intervals between May 1995 and July 1996, five collections of 10 adult abalone (equal sexes) were made from the West Coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Each animal's live mass (without shell) was recorded, and its gonad was aspirated from the digestive gland into a known volume land mass) of seawater. The digestive gland was sliced free of its attachment, weighed, and related to shelf-less body mass as percent digestive gland index (DGI). The gonad live mass was determined from the mass of aspirated mix of gonad and seawater, and related to shell-less body mass to give a percent gonad index (GI). Digestive gland cells were prepared and maintained in a special buffer, and their Vo(2)'s measured in microrespirometers. There was no sex effect on seasonal DGI, but significant seasonal differences in DGIs correlated perfectly with metabolic activity of digestive-gland cells with glucose substrate. Thus, when digestive glands were largest relative to body size, metabolic activity of their cells was greatest. GIs were significantly higher for males than females. There was a significant seasonal effect on GIs, with Values being high in springtime before spawning (April to May, 10-11%) and low in winter (December, 6%), but with statistical overlap between these and summer values (July to August, 7-8%).

"Sun, DG; Zhou, XY; Sun, X; Xu, NJ",Transcriptomic analysis reveals the regulatory mechanism of tetraspore formation in Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis,2023,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,9,,,,1080474,"With the expansion of seaweed culture and changes in the global climate, large quantities of new seaweed germplasm are urgently needed. It is important to elucidate the process of reproductive development and its regulatory mechanism in seaweed. Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis (Rhodophyta) has an essential economic and ecological value, for example, as a raw material for agar extraction and abalone feed. Here, four phases (I to IV) of G. lemaneiformis tetrasporophyte development were analyzed using physiological assays and transcriptome technologies. The results showed that photosynthetic capacity increased during the period from tetraspore formation to the release (Phase II, III and IV). According to transcriptome results, the expression levels of genes associated with light harvesting, photosynthesis, and carbon fixation pathways were significantly upregulated during tetraspore formation and release. Meanwhile, the expression levels of genes encoding starch and trehalose synthesis enzymes in starch and sucrose metabolism were enhanced during tetraspore formation and release, suggesting that G. lemaneiformis requires more energy supply during reproductive development, and that trehalose-6-phosphate may also act as a signaling molecule to induce tetraspore formation. In addition, genes encoding antioxidant enzymes (APX, TRX, GR, TR, PRX, and CAT) were significantly upregulated during tetraspore formation. These results may help us to understand the transition from nutritional to reproductive development and the molecular mechanism of G. lemaneiformis tetrasporogenesis, which is vital for the development of new germplasm and promoting the growth of the seaweed culture industry.",10.3389/fmars.2022.1080474
"Strathmann, RR",Three functionally distinct kinds of pelagic development,2007,BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE,81,2,167,179,,"Interest in pelagic embryos and larvae of benthic marine animals has centered on dispersal and its consequences, but longer pelagic larval durations appear to have evolved and to persist for other reasons than dispersal advantages. Here are explanatory hypotheses for three kinds of pelagic development. (1) Pelagic development prior to ability to feed or settle avoids constraints of oxygen supply to aggregated embryos and scarcity of deposition sites. Also, costs of protection may be greater and survival benefits less than indicated by present evidence. (2) Obligately feeding pelagic larvae migrate to the plankton for greater growth or lower mortality. Under this hypothesis, the observed large scale dispersal is an incidental byproduct of a migration from benthic to pelagic habitat for greater growth or survival. Given pelagic development, unevenly favorable benthic environments and varying currents might result in selection for spread of sibling larvae as a form of bet hedging, but selection for dispersal as a result of pelagic development does not explain evolution of pelagic development. (3) For larvae released near competence for settlement and metamorphosis, the function of the pelagic stage is dispersal and habitat selection. For these larvae, the observed precompetent pelagic periods of seconds to a day may indicate pelagic durations adapted for dispersal because offspring could be protected until release at competence.",

The POs were isolated from hemocytes using lineargradient native-PAGE combined with catechol staining. The PO activities and their characters were investigated. The molecular mass of PO in C. farreri was 576 kDa, and it was 228 kDa in H. discus hannai. In S. subcrenata, four POs were detected and their molecular masses were 391 kDa, 206 kDa, 174 kDa and <67 kDa, which were named as 391-PO, 206-PO, 174-PO and s-PO, respectively. Kinetic analyses indicated that all of the POs, except for 391-PO had higher affinity to L-DOPA and catechol than to hydroquinone and dopamine. However, all of the POs failed to oxidize tyrosine. The effects of divalent metal ions on POs' activities were assayed, including Fe2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Cu2+ and Ca2+ from FeCl2, MgSO4, ZnSO4, MnCl2, CuSO4 and CaCl2. The POs were inhibited by Fe2+ at all determined concentrations. Additionally, the inhibition assay showed that all of the POs were inhibited by cysteine, ascorbic acid, sodium sulfite, citric acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium (EDTA) and sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC). The inhibition effects of critric acid and EDTA are dose-dependent. H. discus hannai PO and 391-PO were slightly inhibited by sodium azide, and H. discus hannai PO, 391-PO and 174-PO were slightly inhibited by thiourea.

The promotion of a sustainable aquaculture industry requires that decision-makers, ecosystem managers and farmers have sufficient quantitative information associated with its implementation from both public and private perspectives. The present paper applies the Differential Drivers Pressure State Impact Response (ADPSIR) methodological approach to an ecological and economic comparison between mono-aquaculture and IMTA. Data from a South African 240-ton year(-1) abalone farm were used as a case study. Three operation schemes were considered: abalone monoculture in a flow-through system; and two IMTA schemes, which recycle water and replace 10% and 30% of kelp consumption with on-farm-grown seaweed. The analysis indicates a decrease in the aquaculture generated ecological pressures with the incorporation of seaweeds, mainly a reduction in nitrogen discharges into the adjacent coastal ecosystem (by 3.7 to 5.0 tons year(-1) a reduction in harvest of natural kelp beds (by 2.2 to 6.6 ha year(-1)) and a reduction of GHG emissions (by 290 to 350 tons CO(2)e year(-1)). Adopting an IMTA configuration raised farm profits by 1.4 to 5%. The corresponding overall gain from using IMTA in the case study is several folds larger than the net gain in profit, and is estimated between 1.1 and 3.0 million U.S. dollar per annum. This range of values reflects the gains of adopting IMTA on (i) economic value of the aquaculture, i.e. farm's profit, (ii) value of environmental externalities, and (iii) implementation costs. The analysis suggests that the value of the benefits to the public by adopting the IMTA configurations can be larger than the gains in farm's profitability. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.

In this study, a novel peptide (A2) from abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) was applied to investigate its antimetastatic effects in MKN-28 gastric cancer cells. Enhanced activities of glycogen-synthase kinase 3 beta(GSK-3 beta) by A2 treatment contributed to modulation of beta-catenin; hence, beta-catenin signaling was downregulated, and translocation of beta-catenin to the nucleus was repressed. Moreover, cellular protrusions including lamellipodia and filopodia were disrupted through downregulation of Rac1 and Cdc42 in response to A2 in MKN-28 cells. It is suggested that A2 inhibits cell migration through controlling levels of beta-catenin, GSK-3 beta, and also induced disorganization of lamellipodia and filopodia.

Collinearity analysis detected numerous tandem duplication events within the Caspase genes, implicating these duplications as the principal evolutionary driver of the Caspase family in H. discus hannai. Sequence diversity analysis found 216 missense mutation sites in Caspase genes of H. discus hannai. Alternative splicing analysis revealed multiple splicing sites and events in Caspase of H. discus hannai. Additionally, differential alternative splicing analysis showed the significant induction of Caspase-2, 3, and 8 variants following Vibrio infection. Transcriptome quantitative and qRT-PCR demonstrated that most Caspase genes in H. discus hannai respond to heat and Vibrio inoculation. Our findings offer novel perspectives on Caspase function and immune modulation mechanisms in H. discus hannai.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.741900

The goal of this study is to look into the causes of non-enzymatic browning and lipid oxidation, as well as how to control them, and their effect on the color of RTE abalone during storage. The control, bloodletting and antioxidants groups (lactic acid, citric acid and 4-hexylresorcinol) of RTE abalone were stored for 0, 20 and 40 days at 40 C-o, respectively, to explore the rule and mechanism of the color change in RTE abalone. This research shows that RTE abalone undergoes browning during storage. Meanwhile, the content of reducing sugar, phenols and unsaturated fatty acids decreases, while the formation of lipid hydroperoxides and aldehydes increases during storage. In addition, the color change in RTE abalone during storage is mainly related to the Maillard reaction, while the lipid oxidation mainly forms pyrrole and participates in the Strecker degradation process as part of the Maillard reaction. The quality of RTE abalone can be maintained by controlling browning effectively as well as lipid oxidation through bloodletting and the addition of antioxidants to ensure that RTE abalone has high storage stability. According to our research, bloodletting and the addition of antioxidants to RTE abalone have a good application prospect and popularizing value in the storage of RTE abalone.",10.3390/foods12071514

A reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses of tissues from H. discus hannai was conducted for sexually mature gonads to determine male- and female-specific target gene expression, including genes encoding zona pellucida domain 4 (zp4), sperm protein (sp) and lysin (lys), respectively. Sex-specific expression patterns of these gene expression, even in sexually immature abalone, indicate these genes can be used as sensitive and robust sex-specific molecular markers. The RT-PCR procedure was also performed to analyze tissues collected at various developmental stages (50-day intervals) beginning at fertilization to determine when sex differentiation and expression of sex-specific genes was initiated. Detection of zp4 transcript in tissues collected at 200 days post-fertilization (dpf) indicated egg-specific development starts at 150-200 dpf. To evaluate possible sex-specific differences in growth rate, there was conducting of a molecular marker-based sex identification of abalone from a population selected for rapid growth rate. In a group of large H. discus hannai, females were more prevalent than males. To assess the correlation between growth and sex, there was comparison of weights of 3-year-old Pacific abalone in specimens where there had been sex determinations by visual examination and molecular methods. The results indicated females weighed more (55.92 +/- 9.38 g, n = 15) than males (43.64 +/- 15.55 g, n = 6, P = 0.037), indicating females had a more rapid growth rate than males.",10.1016/j.anireprosci.2021.106687

One problem that this industry faces is that an uneven distribution of juveniles in tanks can lead to variations in the growth rate. Understanding the cues that affect the sheltering behaviours exhibited by juvenile Pacific abalone-namely, the food distribution and the water flow velocity-will help optimize abalone culture settings. In this study, a group of 1,000 juvenile Pacific abalone (distributed across three tanks) was visually observed and enumerated during six experiments that were conducted over a 5-month study period. It was found that juvenile Pacific abalone preferred to shelter close to food sources when the food was unevenly distributed. When the food was evenly distributed, the juveniles tended to avoid areas of rapid water flow and distributed evenly across the sheltered areas receiving the equal water velocity. This distribution might be the confounding effects between water flow velocity and food stimulus. Based on these findings, it was recommend that the food and water velocity be evenly distributed in an abalone aquaculture system.",10.1111/are.14754

The polysaccharides' compositions were analysed, and their effects on HepG2 cell proliferation were assessed. AVAP I had a greater growth-stimulatory effect than AAP or AVAP II. The oligosaccharide of AVAP I (Oli-AVAP I) exhibited the same growth effects, but rhamnose, the primary monosaccharide of AVAP I and Oli-AVAP I, did not exhibit this activity. Moreover, AVAP I dramatically reduced the mRNA levels of CDK6 and Cyclin El but significantly increased Cyclin B1, CDK1 and Cyclin F. Interestingly, AVAP I remained able to induce cell proliferation in a low serum concentration medium. AVAP I could therefore promote HepG2 cell proliferation by regulating gene expression and accelerating the cell cycle process. AVAP I may be useful as a serum supplement for stimulating the proliferation of mammalian cells. Our results offer a comprehensive method for utilising the abalone viscera, which is usually discarded as waste. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.01.032

For example, the commercial cultivation of highly-prized abalone (Haliotidae: Vetigastropoda) has been hampered by naturally slow growth rates. To begin to investigate the molecular mechanisms controlling growth in haliotid molluscs, we chose to focus on neuropeptides secreted from anterior brain ganglia, because these have been implicated in controlling growth and reproduction in non-commercial gastropods. Here, we report the characterisation of three neuropeptides expressed in the anterior cerebral and pleuropedal ganglia of the tropical abalone Haliotis asinina; these are (1) the evolutionarily-conserved molluscan insulin-like peptide (Has-MIP), (2) a gastropod-specific schistosomin-like peptide (Has-SLP) and (3) a novel peptide currently known only from abalone, which we have called the haliotid growth-associated peptide (Has-HGAP). The novel Has-HGAP gene encodes a prepropeptide that undergoes substantial post-translational processing, including cleavage at an unusual site separating the two mature peptide chains of 19 and 51 amino acids in length; these are covalently bound by disulfide bonds. Quantitative comparison of Has-HGAP, Has-SLP and Has-MIP transcript abundance between the fastest and slowest growing individuals within a cohort of 6 month old cultured H. asinina reveals that Has-HGAP and Has-SLP are significantly upregulated in fast growing abalone; in contrast, Has-MIP is significantly downregulated. In light of their differential expression among juvenile abalone with markedly different growth rates, we suggest these neuropeptide genes will be fruitful points of focus for improving H. asinina growth rates in aquaculture by marker-assisted selective breeding.

One important question is whether OA will alter species interactions. Crustose coralline algae (CCA) provide space and chemical cues for larval settlement. CCA have shown strongly negative responses to OA in previous studies, including disruption of settlement cues to corals. In California, CCA provide cues for seven species of harvested, threatened, and endangered abalone. We exposed four common CCA genera and a crustose calcifying red algae, Peyssonnelia (collectively CCRA) from California to three pCO(2) levels ranging from 419-2,013 ae atm for four months. We then evaluated abalone (Haliotis rufescens) settlement under ambient conditions among the CCRA and non-algal controls that had been previously exposed to the pCO2 treatments. Abalone settlement and metamorphosis increased from 11% in the absence of CCRA to 45-69% when CCRA were present, with minor variation among CCRA genera. Though all CCRA genera reduced growth during exposure to increased pCO(2), abalone settlement was unaffected by prior CCRA exposure to increased pCO(2). Thus, we find no impacts of OA exposure history on CCRA provision of settlement cues. Additionally, there appears to be functional redundancy in genera of CCRA providing cues to abalone, which may further buffer OA effects.",10.1038/s41598-017-05502-x

These nutrients encourage primary productivity, forming the foundation of coastal food webs and the fisheries depending on them. Understanding past variability in the occurrence of upwelling and primary productivity may offer insight into how upwelling dynamics and ecosystem productivity could vary in the future. Numerous proxies from sediment cores inform most upwelling reconstructions; however, their temporal resolution is typically decadal at best. However, questions regarding ecosystem responses to changes in physical processes require data with seasonal to sub-seasonal resolution because such data provide additional insight into seasonal extremes (e.g., surface temperature, precipitation, etc.). The calcium carbonate skeletons of mollusks provide invaluable data from stable oxygen (delta O-18) and carbon (delta C-13) isotopes that generate high-resolution reconstructions of environmental variables. Recent studies of stable nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes in mollusk shell organic materials demonstrate the potential to produce high-resolution reconstructions of nutrient cycling. Collectively, these measurements may provide insight into upwelling conditions over the life of the organism. This study presents preliminary data exploring the potential of analyzing a suite of stable nitrogen, oxygen and carbon isotope data from analysis of Pacific abalone shells (Haliotis cracherodii). We present sub-seasonal delta N-15 time series data that, together with delta O-18 and delta C-13, reflect seasonal variability closely linked to upwelling. delta N-15 values range from 8.3 parts per thousand to 11.0 parts per thousand and align closely with delta O-18 values, which range from -0.5 parts per thousand to 1.1 parts per thousand. Implications of this research are twofold: 1) Isotopic analyses from abalone shells may provide detailed knowledge on primary productivity during upwelling as well as limited productivity when upwelling is greatly reduced and 2) archaeological shell middens in the Channel Islands contain an abundance of both abalone dating back to the early Holocene, presenting the opportunity to reconstruct upwelling conditions throughout the Holocene.",10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110342

Estimating such relationship is critical for informing the management and conservation of exploited species because it determines a natural population's response to exploitation. In the current study, recruitment rates of abalone Haliotis fulgens and Haliotis corrugata were recorded by means of postlarval collectors inside and outside 2 marine reserves in 2 subsequent years. At the same time and locations, theoretical reproductive outputs were computed by combining estimates of abalone densities and size structure with literature data on size-dependent fecundity and size at sexual maturity. We found that observed settlement rates correlated positively and significantly with estimated reproductive output, suggesting that greater production of eggs by large and fecund individuals can result in predictably high recruitment rates. In addition, the slope of the linear relationship suggests that the proportion of eggs that settle and metamorphose to become postlarvae is between 0.2% and 0.3%. Although affected by great uncertainty, this value constitutes a unique estimate of larval survival for the genus Haliotis in a natural environment.",10.2983/035.032.0122

The concentrations of zeaxanthin and beta-carotene detected in the orange-muscle abalones were significantly higher than those detected in the common abalones (p < 0.01).

It is therefore economically desirable to maximize the conversion of feed protein into a valuable biomass, and environmentally desirable to minimize nitrogenous waste. Both ends can be achieved in algal-dependent integrated mariculture. Unlike fish-cage effluents, fishpond effluents can be treated. Use of marketable organisms as biofilters increases both diversification and income of the mariculture operation. Algal biofiltration has a stabilizing influence on water quality since, unlike bacteria, algae counteract the consumption of oxygen and the production Of CO2 by the fish. However, algal biofilters probably cost more to build and use a larger land area when compared with the alternative bacterial nitrification-denitrification aquaculture biofilter systems. Biofiltration by algae and shellfish, as has been developed as a part of integrated mariculture at the Israeli National Center for Mariculture, offsets the added cost by added sales of the biofilter organisms. This approach is based on algal sunlight-dependent assimilation of nutrients and their conversion into microalgal or macroalgal biomass. The algae are then consumed by algivore invertebrates such as bivalves, gastropods, and sea urchins. Sea urchins in particular can also be used to remove organic detritus. In the fish-phytoplankton-bivalve integrated culture system, bivalves filter microalgae that develop in fishponds and sedimentation ponds in which fishpond effluents collect. Such systems require large treatment areas relative to fish production, and are therefore suitable for extensive or semi-intensive fish culture with relatively low land costs. In fish-seaweed integrated culture, nutrients are removed from the fishpond effluents by green macroalgae such as Ulva lactuca. The macroalgae (seaweeds) can subsequently be fed to macroalgivores or processed for human consumption. While water from the fishponds passes through the macroalgae ponds, most of the ammonia (up to 90%,,) and significant fractions of other dissolved nutrients are removed from the water. The macroalgae improve the quality of the water by adding O-2 and removing excess CO2, thus making the water suitable for recirculation into the fishponds. The seaweed produced is excellent for feeding high-value macroalgivores such as abalone and sea urchins. Fish-seaweed integrated systems require less extensive land area than fish-phytoplankton-bivalve integrated systems and produce cleaner effluents. However, they may require larger inputs of capital and energy. Fish culture integrated with algal and shellfish biofilters has the potential to expand sustainably, meeting economic, environmental, and social concerns.",

Environmental hypoxia events can have significant effects on marine organisms, but for breeding programs and other practical applications, it is important to further explore the long-term physiological effects of early hypoxia exposure in economically significant species. In this study, the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai was exposed to moderate hypoxia (similar to 4 mg/L) from zygote to trochophora, and the assessments of hypoxia tolerance were conducted on the grow-out stage. The results revealed that juvenile abalones exposed to hypoxia at the early development stages were more hypoxiatolerant but with slower weight growth, a phenomenon called the trade- off between growth and survival. These phenotypic effects driven by the hypoxia exposure were explained by strong selection of genes involved in signal transduction, autophagy, apoptosis, and hormone regulation. Moreover, long non-coding RNA regulation plays an important role modulating carry-over effects by controlling DNA replication and repair, signal transduction, myocardial activity, and hormone regulation.

Some enzyme activity parameters of hepatopancreas extracts were also performed, including Na+-K+-ATPase, Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase, peroxidase (POD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) production. After analyzing the proteomics profile of hepatopancreas by 2D gel electrophoresis, we found that 24 spots significantly increased or decreased at protein expression level (>= 2-fold difference) in the 2D-maps from the treatment groups. Eighteen out of 24 protein spots were successfully identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS).

Pseudo-first order rate constants (K-for) in the forward (ATP forming) reaction direction showed maximal increases from basal values of 0.025 s(-1) to 0.095, 0.114, 0.126 s(-1) for NaN3 hypoxia, and PCP exposures, respectively. Increases in K-for were inversely correlated (r(2) = 1.00) to declines in ATP concentration in all exposed animals. Flux (the product of K-for, and phosphoarginine concentration) appeared to converge on a common value, from basal flux values of 0.257 mM PA s(-1) to 0.703, 0.770, and 0.627 mM PA s(-1) for NaN3, hypoxia, and PCP exposures, respectively. It seems likely that all three stresses were equally effective at inhibiting mitochondrial ATP formation, which may account for the similarity in flux increase, possibly to maximal rates of AK-mediated ATP formation. Differences in K-for, are related to declines in ATP concentrations, which appear to be stress specific, and likely indicate additional mechanisms of toxicity for NaN3 and PCP.

The bait should be chosen primarily according to the intended specificity, which varies depending on its aimed role. This is, however, insufficient, and attention should be paid to other specificity, because the estimated index sometimes varies keeping correlation to one another. The correlation between the level of asymptote of retained individuals and other parameter was helpful in choosing the suitable baits.",10.2331/fishsci.68.sup1_801

In South Africa, the recently introduced polychaete Boccardia proboscidea has been recorded at the outflow of abalone farms where they are known to infest the shells of these mollusks. To determine if B. proboscidea can become established along the South African coast and subsequently expand its range, we assessed brood size, larval size at hatching, larval survivorship and developmental time and rate of this species under temperature regimes reflective of those found along the coast. We also investigated similar temperature dependent development in the well-established non-indigenous shell borer Polydora hoplura which can serve as a proxy for our predictions. Worms were cultured in glass capillary tubes at five different temperature treatments (12 degrees C, 17 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 24 degrees C, 28 degrees C) and planktotrophic and adelphophagic larvae were tracked from oviposition to settlement. We found that in P. hoplura, females producing adelphophagic larvae had smaller broods at the highest temperature treatment and higher temperatures resulted in significantly larger sizes at hatching. Survivorship of planktotrophic and adelphophagic larvae was highest at the intermediate to high temperature treatments (21 degrees C and 24 degrees C) and was generally lower at the lower temperatures (12 degrees C and 17 degrees C). Temperature had no significant effect on brood size of B. pro boscidea whereas higher temperatures resulted in larger hatching sizes for planktotrophic and adelphophagic larvae. In B. proboscidea, larval types showed differences in survival optima with planktotrophic larvae exhibiting its highest survivorship at the colder temperatures and lowest at the warmer temperatures while adelphophagic larvae had its highest survivorship at 21 degrees C and its lowest at the extreme temperatures. There was a positive relationship between temperature and developmental rate for both species. The difference in larval sizes of the non-feeding planktotrophic larvae of B. proboscidea was attributed to a growth window that allowed for variability in reproductive traits based on exogenous factors such as temperature. More importantly, the results indicate that B. pro boscidea will be capable of producing viable populations at different localities along the South African coast including those where P. hoplura has already been established.

The macroalgae was cultured in various enriched media at a stocking density of 500 kg wet weight/pond. Overall, U. armoricana was able to remove a greater percentage of inorganic nitrogen in the double fertilizer ratio. The total dissolved phosphate was higher in standard seawater. U. armoricana showed preference for bioaccumulation, with ranges as follows: zinc (9.908 - 32.942 mg. kg(-1)); copper (1.893 - 5.927 mg. kg(-1)); cadmium (0.254 - 1.500 mg. kg(-1)); and lead (none detected). Apart from the presence of cadmium (Cd), the algal biomass produced at the end of the experiment was of a relatively good quality with limited heavy metal contamination so that U. armoricana could be successfully used as a plant stimulant but not as part of a feed formulation for livestock and for the food industry.

"Shpigel, M",Bivalves as biofilters and valuable by-products in land-based aquaculture systems,2005,Comparative Roles of Suspension-Feeders in Ecosystems,47,,183,197,,"Effluents from land-based mariculture have a deleterious environmental impact by enriching littoral waters With particulate and dissolved nutrients. The use of suspension-feeders (e.g. bivalves) in biofiltration systems provides an inexpensive option for the biological removal of these nutrients from effluent water. Land-based facilities are safer because the quality of the incoming water can be controlled, and integrated polyculture systems can save resources, diversify the product, allow intensification, and are environmentally friendly, thus offering a valid alternative to open sea monoculture. Several approaches have been developed to reach this goal. These approaches are based on the use of algae and invertebrates as biofilters, which remove the dissolved and particulate nutrients from fishpond effluents. Sunlight-dependent assimilation turns excess nutrients into microalgae biomass, which is then consumed with other organic particulate matter by the invertebrates. These systems consist of three units: a) a fish or shrimp culture unit, b) an earthen pond that serves as both a microalgal production and a bivalve culture unit, and c) a seaweed biofilter unit. Microalgae, especially benthic diatoms, are responsible for most of the nutrient uptake. The main cultured herbivores are filter-feeding bivalves, which grow in the earthen pond. The seaweed biofilter strips the remaining dissolved nutrients from the effluents. The harvested yields (fish, bivalve and seaweed) contain 63% of the nitrogen introduced into the system, particulate matter (faeces and uneaten feed) contain 33%, and suspended and dissolved outflow, approximately 4% of the nitrogen budget. More complex systems require highly skilled operators and more sophisticated technology, but they provide increased product diversity. Depending on practical factors such as market prices, quality and cost of labor, seed and fingerlings supply, environmental conditions, market size and property cost, the operational protocol can be shifted between the three product types (fish, algae and invertebrates) to maximize profits.",

We used multiple-choice feeding assays to ascertain the relative feeding preferences of four subtidal grazers (the amphipod Aora typica, the isopod Batedotea elongata and the gastropods Cookia sulcata and Haliotis iris) for the invasive macroalga Undaria pinnatifida and six native macroalgae (Macrocystis pyrifera, Durvillaea antarctica, Carpophyllum flexuosum, Cystophora scalaris, Marginariella boryana and Ulva spp.) that are all abundant along the Otago coast of southern New Zealand. Multiple-choice feeding assays were run under laboratory conditions during the austral autumn (April and June) of 2013. The relative abundances of the macroalgae in the field were also determined. All of the grazers ate U. pinnatifida at rates comparable to most of the native macroalgae, except for B. elongata, which barely consumed it. This indicates that U. pinnatifida, which was shown to be more abundant than native macroalgae in subtidal habitats, has the potential to contribute organic matter to the local food web and may be an undesirable food for some group of grazers.

This research paper focuses on total iodine quantification in abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) and its components (viscera and muscle) using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Additionally, an in vitro bioavailability study explored iodine absorption potential. Abalone pretreatment involved both the European standard method (ES) and microwave-assisted extraction method (MAE). The limits of detection (LOD) were 0.11 ng/g for both ES and MAE, with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 5.4 ng/g for MAE. Accuracy, assessed using a reference material (fish muscle, ERM-BB422), showed values of 1.5 +/- 0.010 mg/kg for ES and 1.6 +/- 0.066 mg/kg for MAE, within an acceptable range of 1.4 +/- 0.42 mg/kg. Precision, evaluated using the Horwitz ratio (HorRat) with a reference material, was determined to be 0.45 for ES and 0.27 for MAE. Therefore, total iodine contents were estimated as 74 +/- 2.2 mu g/g for abalone viscera and 17 +/- 0.77 mu g/g for abalone muscle with ES, and 76 +/- 1.0 mu g/g for abalone viscera and 17 +/- 0.51 mu g/g for abalone muscle with MAE. Recovery tests demonstrated an acceptable range of 90-110%. In the in vitro bioavailability assessment, digestion efficiency yielded ranges of 42-50.2% for viscera and 67-115% for muscle.

Genetic techniques may help to distinguish populations that are self-sustaining from those at risk of further decline, and demographic interdependence among subpopulations. We tested the use of genetic data for identifying stable and self-sustaining abalone populations, as well as the efficacy of a restoration technique for use in those populations that are not. We created an artificial aggregation of wild adult pink abalone (Haliotis corrugata) in the Point Loma kelp forest near San Diego, CA, USA. We genetically analyzed those individuals and additional adults and juveniles in the broader region. A self-sustained population should not be demographically reliant upon immigration. Temporal variability in relatedness among juvenile cohorts, and a lack of fine-scale spatial structure in adult and juvenile relatedness indicated complex recruitment dynamics and/or long distance larval delivery. We estimated a low effective population size (N-e = 188) and a very low ratio of effective population to census population size (N-e/N = 2.0 x 10(-3)). These data are consistent with sweepstakes reproductive success, and suggest that the population is at risk of genetic diversity decline. Parentage assignment revealed that none of the juveniles sampled one year after aggregating adults had parents from this aggregation. Collectively, our results suggest that restoration efforts will need to achieve a greater density (0.18 m(-2)) and/or number of individuals (46) to improve local recruitment. Our results also suggest that the Point Loma kelp forest population of pink abalone is of insufficient density for long-term viability, may be reliant upon immigration, and cannot be defined as an independent local population unit.

Tagged juveniles (2 years old) were released into their natural habitat and recaptured after 2-5 years from the date of release. The recaptured individuals (n =3) had the same number of internal growth rings as their age in addition to one disturbance ring. Results of stable oxygen isotope analysis on the shell cross-sections confirmed that the growth rings were deposited between winter and spring when the temperature decreased below 7 degrees C. Furthermore, the disturbance rings that were observed only in the released individuals were formed at the time of release into the natural habitat. Comparing the validity of the age determination method developed in this study with the conventional burning shell method, the age estimated by the conventional method was less than that by the present method for 8-year-old abalone.

Relative to the mainland and other Channel Islands, San Miguel Island (SMI) consistently maintains cooler water temperatures and supports significant populations of red abalone Haliotis rufescens, presumably owing to increased food production and diminished expression of the bacterial disease known as withering syndrome. We conducted a laboratory experiment to examine the effects of La Nina and El Nino conditions on the health and survival of red abalone from SMI. Six replicate tanks per treatment, each containing six abalone, were subjected to one of the following three temperature regimes (treatments): Bodega Bay, California ambient (AMB; mean, 11.4 degrees C), SMI La Nina regime (LAN; mean, 13.8 degrees C), and SMI El Nino regime (ELN; mean, 16.5 degrees C). After 328 d, survival in the ELN treatment was significantly lower than in the AMB and LAN groups. A body condition index was significantly lower in the ELN group than in the AMB group, and the LAN group was in between. A visual score of body shrinkage was significantly higher in both the LAN and ELN groups than in the AMB group. Other clinical signs of withering syndrome and the prevalence and infection intensity of the causative agent, Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis, increased as temperature increased in the three treatment groups from AMB to LAN to ELN, although the differences were not statistically significant. Generally, we found that increased temperature resulted in elevated disease expression, although less than observed in previous studies that used farmed abalone and higher, less variable temperature regimes.

We examined the effect of the timing of metamorphosis on the development of the central nervous system (CNS), concentrating on the pattern of serotonin and small cardioactive peptide- (SCP) immunopositive neurons in the cerebral ganglia. By 4 days postfertilization the cerebral ganglion has five pairs of serotonin-immunoreactive (IR) neurons, one pair of which (the V cells) innervate the velum. This complement of cells remains stable for as long as the larval stage persists but metamorphosis causes the rapid loss of the V cells. In the case of SCP-IR neurons, one pair is present prior to metamorphic competency, but as larvae continue to age in the absence of inducing cues, additional pairs are gradually added. Metamorphosis causes an acceleration in SCP-IR neuron addition. This separation of developmental patterns is well adapted for the inherent uncertainty of the timing of metamorphosis in abalone larvae.",10.1002/neu.480230705

Juvenile green abalones (H. fulgens) tagged in the field and laboratory grew from 13 to 16 mm per yr; adult annual growth ranged from 4 to 7 mm. Transplants to depths below the normal limit did not grow. For white abalones (H. sorenseni) in the laboratory, juveniles grew 25 mm per yr, adults grew 10 mm per yr. In the field adults showed little shell growth, probably because they actively eroded their shells on the experimental tiles to which they had been transplanted. In all species smaller individuals grew faster in absolute length than did larger ones, independent of treatment. Growth rates calculated from polymodal size frequency analyses agreed closely with those from diet observations of tagged individuals. Based on these data, von Bertalanffy growth curves were constructed. Relative growth in soft-body weight decreased gradually with increasing size. All three species showed seasonal variations in growth; each species had a different season of maximum growth. During the autumn when gonad growth occurs in adult pink abalones, growth was significantly lower than in the preceding summer or the following winter. Juvenile pink abalones did not show this pattern. These results suggest that there may be a shift in energy allocation into reproduction and away from growth in this species.

Understanding how species respond to such changes, such as in their feeding interactions and physiology, is key to predicting their resilience to both seasonal and longer term climate changes. The Sitka Sound in Southeast Alaska, USA, is an attractive natural laboratory for studying change, as the marine environment experiences substantial seasonal fluctuations in parameters such as temperature, pH, and productivity between summer and winter. By sampling a suite of dominant macrophyte algae and their benthic herbivores in winter (January) and summer (July) 2019, we investigated how producers and their primary consumers may respond to seasonal change inferred through fatty acid trophic markers. We used a fatty acid logratio selection and analysis approach to ask the following: (1) Do fatty acid biomarkers for algae differ between seasons? (2) Do the same fatty acid biomarkers differ between seasons when applied to herbivores, with herbivore fatty acids tracking the presumed trophic resources? (3) Do fatty acid biomarkers for herbivores differ between seasons, when considered independently from algae? Comparing logratio sets selected each for the algae and the herbivore fatty acids, we found that algae fatty acids were different between our sampling seasons, but the algae-selected fatty acid logratios did not clearly separate most herbivores by season. In contrast, the herbivore-selected logratios strongly distinguished herbivore species between the January and June samplings. Further, dispersions of fatty acid logratios were greater within herbivore species in the winter than in the summer, potentially due to the utilization of more diverse resources when preferred algae are less abundant. In total, results suggest that herbivores are not simply tracking the seasonal fatty acid changes in the dominant algae as trophic resources; instead, herbivore fatty acid seasonal changes may occur largely through some other nonexclusive mechanisms, such as omnivory, reductions or shifts in dietary composition, and/or endogenous physiological responses. Thus, the benthic herbivores in our study appear not to be locked into their diets when faced with seasonal change and may use a range of strategies, including diet diversification, to cope with environmental variation.",10.1002/ecs2.70135

In addition, it has been shown to play central roles in immune modulation, cell-growth regulation, and antimicrobial activity. In this study, a multitechnical approach was used to fully characterize the LALBA gene and its variants in both coding and regulatory regions for domestic camelids (dromedary, Bactrian camel, alpaca, and llama). The gene analysis revealed a conserved structure among the camelids, but a slight difference in size (2,012 bp on average) due to intronic variations. Promoters were characterized for the transcription factor binding sites (11 found in total). Intraspecies sequence comparison showed 36 SNPs in total (2 in the dromedary, none in the Bactrian camel, 22 in the alpaca, and 12 in the llama), whereas interspecies comparison showed 86 additional polymorphic sites. Eight SNPs were identified as trans-specific polymorphisms, and 2 of them (g.112A>G and g.1229A>G) were particularly interesting in the New World camels. The first creates a new binding site for transcription factor SP1. An enhancing effect of the g.112G variant on the expression was demonstrated by 3 independent pGL3 gene reporter assays. The latter is responsible for the p.78Ile>Val AA replacement and represents novel allelic variants (named LALBA A and B). A link to protein variants has been established by isoelectric focusing (IEF), and bioinformatics analysis revealed that carriers of valine (g.1229G) have a higher glycosylation rate. Genotyping methods based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) were set up for both SNPs. Overall, adenine was more frequent (0.54 and 0.76) at both loci. Four haplotypes were found, and the AA and GA were the most common with a frequency of 0.403 and 0.365, respectively. Conversely, a putative biological gain characterizes the haplotype GG.

Recently, a homologue of Rel\NF-kappa B transcription factor was identified from a gastropod abalone, Haliotis diversicolor supertexta, named Ab-Rel. We present here a new strategy, so called magnetocapture, based on magnetic separation that was developed to isolate and detect this abalone transcriptional factor. With this method, Ab-Rel was successfully isolated from abalone haemocytes and the recombinant Ab-Rel protein from an insect cell line. Western blot analysis was performed to verify the effectiveness of this magnetocapture assay. Since only the activated NF-kappa B can be captured and separated from the whole cell extracts, this method was simultaneously used to detect the NF-kappa B activity in vivo, as well as the biological activity of the recombinant protein in vitro. In addition, several proteins which might interact with the abalone NF kappa B were together isolated, suggesting that the magnetocapture method would be useful for identifying interaction molecules.

Increased mortality since 1999 was focused inshore of a southeast trending line extending from approximately the Delaware Bay mouth to the central continental shelf off the mouth of Chesapeake Bay. To investigate further the proximate causes of mortality, we carried out a histopathological survey of surf clams collected along this southeast-trending mortality line. The most northern stations had the highest condition indices, the lowest gonadal abnormality scores, with one exception, and the lowest digestive gland atrophy scores. Animals at the stations with lowest average condition index had body weights less than 65% of the average animal taken at the station with the highest condition index. A syndrome describing a malnourished state common in clams taken along the mortality line emerged from this analysis. Animals with low condition were also animals with higher scores of gonadal abnormality and higher scores of digestive gland atrophy. Neither parasites, nematodes and cestodes, occurred commonly, nor instances of hemocyte infiltration, also common, were significantly correlated with low condition index and the associated tissue disorders indicative of malnutrition. Nematodes and the frequently associated instances of focal infiltration by hemocytes were not obviously more common in the southern stations where condition index was low. Cestodes tended to occur more frequently at sites where condition index was low, but infection intensity was high at some stations not so characterized. No disease-causing organisms were observed in this study. Starvation, brought on by regional shifts in temperature mismatching food supply and feeding rate with tissue maintenance needs, offers one potential mechanism explaining the distribution of apparently malnourished clams and the origin of the increase in mortality inshore of the mortality line.",

The dynamics, processes, environment and management of semi-intensive (several tons ha(-1)y(-1)) mariculture IMTA started in the early 1970s, at the National Center for Mariculture (NCM) in Eilat, with several models that combined flow-through and recirculation features between primary (fed) and secondary (extractive) species. The seawater fishponds differed from freshwater ponds mainly in the continuous exchange with water from the open sea, to stabilize salinity and other water quality features. The primary (fed) fish was mostly the seabream (Spares aurata), seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), shrimp (Penaeus semisulcatus) and mullets (Mugil cephalus and Liza ramada). At first, the extractive component included microalgae, oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and clams (Ruditapes philippnmarum). In more progressive models, plastic-lined double drain ponds and tanks are used. Several other species, for example: clams, seaweed (the macroalgae Ulva spp. and Gracilaria spp.), abalone (Haliotis tuberculata and H. discus hannai), sea urchins (Paracentrotus lividus and Tripneustes gratilla elatensis), shrimp, brine shrimp (Anemia salMa) are used. Wetlands planted with the halophytes Salicornia sp. and Sarcocrnia sp. have been integrated as IMTA. Recently, periphyton and drip-irrigated algal biofilters were examined and found to be practical. The research contributed to the enhancement of the sustainability, flexibility and potential for profitability of the aquaculture operation, based on the accumulated understanding about the functioning of the different units and the interactions between them. The principles developed in this research are relevant to brackishwater aquaculture, and have been applied for shrimp culture, mainly in China.",10.2112/SI86-003.1

The aim of this study was to analyze inter-annual variation in recruitment, mortality, total and vulnerable biomass, selectivity, and harvest rate of Haliotis fulgens. A size-structured model was used to assess changes in the population dynamics and management quantities from 2010 to 2019. The model describes the exploitation and growth of individuals in the population, and incorporates a stochastic growth matrix that defines the variation in the length increments of individual to individual. Key results indicated that the recruitment failures occurred in infrequent pulses of varying intensity. Moreover, a slight recovery of total biomass during 2017 (791 t), 2018 (1496 t), and 2019 (1274 t) was observed after a slight increase in recruitment and a decrease in harvest rate. The vulnerable biomass increased 44.38% from 2010 to 2019. The harvest rate revealed that individuals larger than the minimum legal size of 145 mm were under high fishing pressure. The stock assessment model highlights an adverse effect in the population; given the deteriorating conditions of the green abalone fishery, it is imperative to transition fully to a recovery strategy, including all the administrative zones in the assessment and management. The adoption of proactive strategies such as the establishment of reference points, no-fishing reserves, and the implementation of a farming system would facilitate the protection of critical abalone populations, contributing to their medium-term recovery, and would be an economic alternative for local fishers.",10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2024.107134

Preliminarily the optimal growth dynamic conditions of selected diatoms were evaluated in relation light intensity by the use of polycarbonate carboys containing PVC filaments for supporting the growth of diatoms. The results showed that the different diatom strains reached the highest cell densities in terms of cell coverage, at 50 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) of light intensity after 120 h for NC, CC and NV strains and 144 h for NAV strain. These results guarantee the massive productions of the selected diatoms for their use as commercial scale. The determination of the multi-especific effect of selected diatoms on the settlement and growth of differents postlarvae cohorts, after 60 and 120 days from the larval metamorphosis, showed significant improvements on settlement and growth of abalone seeds.

WS-RLP infection is not sufficient to cause withering syndrome, and for reasons not yet well understood additional stressors such as elevated water temperature appear to influence disease development. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based metabolomics, we have investigated the influence of food availability, temperature, and bacterial infection, both individually and in combination, on the metabolic status of the red abalone. Food limitation caused dramatic reductions in all observed classes of foot muscle metabolites, while at the same time metabolite levels within the digestive gland were preserved or increased. We also found that food limitation in combination with elevated temperature led to greater metabolic perturbations in both tissue types than those observed under food limitation alone. WS-RLP infection and food-limitation resulted in many of the same metabolic changes within the tissues studied, although the effects of infection were less severe. We observed increased levels of homarine in the digestive gland of both food-limited and WS-RLP-infected animals, yet only observed increased homarine levels in the foot muscle of infected abalone. These results further support the recently established glucose-to-homarine ratio in foot muscle as a potential marker for differentiating WS-RLP-infected animals from those of both healthy and food limited abalone. Furthermore, we found that the NMR metabolic data correlates well with histological measurements supporting the use of the metabolomics approach for characterizing both normal and pathological events in marine species, particularly during periods of environmentally relevant stress.",10.1007/s11306-005-4428-3

"Lampert, KP",Oxygen concentration drives local adaptation in the greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata),2018,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,27,7,1521,1523,,"Understanding adaptation has become one of the major biological questions especially in the light of rapid environmental changes induced by climate change. Ocean temperatures are rising which triggers massive changes in water chemistry and thereby alters the living environment of all marine organisms. Studying adaptation, however, can be tricky because spatial genetic patterns might also occur due to random effects, for example, genetic drift. Genetic drift is reduced in very large and well-connected populations, such as in broadcast marine spawning organisms. Here, spatial genetic divergence is likely to be produced by selection. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Sandoval-Castillo etal. (2018) investigated patterns of spatial genetic divergence and their association with environmental factors in the greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata). This commercially important species of mollusc is a broadcast spawner with large population sizes, rendering genetic drift an unlikely factor in the genetic divergence of wild populations. Sandoval-Castillo etal. (2018) used a ddRAD genomic approach to test for genetic divergence between sampled populations while also measuring different environmental factors, for example, water temperature and oxygen content. The majority of identified SNPs was putatively neutral and showed only low levels of genetic divergence between field sites. However, 323 candidate adaptive markers were identified that clearly separated the individuals into five different clusters. These genetic clusters correlated with environmental clusters mainly determined by water temperature and (correlated) oxygen concentration. Gene annotation of the candidate SNPs revealed a large proportion of loci being involved in biological processes influenced by oxygen availability. The study by Sandoval-Castillo etal. (2018) in this issue of Molecular Ecology exemplifies the benefits of combining genomic studies with ecological data. It is a great starting point for more detailed (gene function, physiology) as well as broader (biodiversity) investigations that might help us to better understand adaptation and predict ecosystems' resilience and resistance to environmental disturbances. In addition, this information can be applied to implement optimal conservation regime policies and sustainable harvesting strategies, hopefully protecting biodiversity as well as commercial interests in marine life.",10.1111/mec.14563

Embryos and larvae of the sea urchin Lytechinus pictus (Verrill) were used to test hypotheses regarding differential costs of protein synthesis in animals differing in size, rates of protein synthesis, and physiological feeding states. For embryos, the rate of protein synthesis was 0.22 +/- 0.014 ng protein embryo(-1) h(-1) (mean +/- s.e.m.) and decreased in unfed larvae to an average rate of 0.05 +/- 0.001 ng protein larva(-1) h(-1). Fed larvae had rates of synthesis that were up to 194 times faster than unfed larvae (9.7 +/- 0.81 ng protein larva(-1) h(-1)). There was no significant difference, however, in the cost of protein synthesis between these larvae with very different physiological states. Furthermore, the cost of synthesis in the larval stages was also similar to costs measured for blastula and gastrula embryos of 8.4 +/- 0.99 J mg(-1) protein synthesized. The cost of protein synthesis was obtained using both direct ('inhibitor') and indirect ('correlative') measurements; both methods gave essentially identical results. Protein synthesis accounted for up to 54 +/- 8% of metabolic rate in embryos. Percent of metabolism accounted for by protein synthesis in larvae was dependent on their physiological feeding state, with protein synthesis accounting for 16 +/- 4% in unfed larvae and 75 +/- 11% in fed larvae. This regulation of metabolic rate was due to differential rates of synthesis for a fixed energy cost per unit mass of protein synthesized. The cost of synthesizing a unit of protein did not change with increasing rates of protein synthesis. We conclude that the cost of protein synthesis is independent of the rate of synthesis, developmental stage, size and physiological feeding state during sea urchin development.",10.1242/jeb.01962

To test the generality and nature of this association, surveys were carried out at five sites between Cape Point and Danger Point in the kelp beds of the South-western Cape, South Africa. These showed that both species occupy primarily hard substrate, showing preferences for encrusting coralline algae. They also confirmed a strong. positive relationship between urchins and juvenile abalone. Of the juvenile abalone sampled, more than 98% were found beneath sea urchins. All small(3-10 mm) and medium-sired (11-20 mm) juvenile abalone were under urchins, whether on flat or vertical reef, or in crevices. A small proportion (similar to 10%) of larger juveniles (21-35 mm) was not found under urchins, and in these instances they occupied crevices instead. These findings are of particular importance in terms of their implications for the lucrative commercial abalone fishery in South Africa, indicating that urchins are of critical importance to the continued survival of viable abalone populations. There has been a dramatic decrease in natural populations of sea urchins over the past five years in the heart of the abalone fishing grounds, and the present findings suggest that this will lead to recruitment failure of abalone. because juvenile abalone seem dependent on the urchins.

However, maternal nutritional deficiencies driven by alimentary restrictions would expectedly impact pinniped development and fitness, as an adequate supply of nutrients is essential for growth and proper functioning of all body systems, including red blood cell synthesis and clearance. Here, we investigated red blood cell morphology of California sea lion (CSL) pups from the San Benito Archipelago born during the 2014 and 2015 anomalously high SST events recorded in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. We examined whether atypical erythrocyte morphologies were more common in 2015, when the high SST event was more pronounced, and whether the stable isotope signature of pup fur, as an indicator of maternal feeding strategies, accounted for the number of atypical cells. Various atypical erythrocyte morphologies were more prevalent and more abundant than reference values. Evidence of iron deficiency was found in both years, and only pups born in 2014 showed evidence of active erythropoiesis. Microcytes and reticulocytes were more common in pups with higher isotopic delta C-13 and lower delta N-15 values, suggesting a probable relationship between maternal feeding strategies and the effect of climatic anomalies on red blood cell physiology of their pups. As developing pinnipeds require increased oxygen storage capacity for diving and foraging, the presence of atypical erythrocytes could be relevant to CSL pup fitness if the underlying cause is not reverted.

Current restoration actions are facing threats of ocean acidification and warming in the northeast Pacific. This research aims to deepen our understanding of the tolerance and physiological flexibility of early life history stages of pinto abalone and inform hatchery practices under future climate change scenarios. We conducted an experiment to test how seawater pH and temperature stress impact abalone larvae. We exposed abalone post-fertilization to elevated temperature and reduced seawater pH for ten days spanning their larval development period: (1) 7.95pH/14 degrees C (ambient), (2) 7.60pH/14 degrees C, (3) 7.95pH/18 degrees C, and (4) 7.60pH/18 degrees C. Abalone in the ambient treatment had the best survival, those in the 7.60pH/18 degrees C treatment had the worst survival, and those in the two single-stressor treatments had survival in between. Among the surviving larvae, pH was the dominant stressor influencing settlement success, with higher settlement rates under ambient pH treatments at both temperatures. pH also had a stronger effect than temperature on shell length.

A promising mitigation strategy is the identification and breeding of shellfish varieties exhibiting resilience to acidification stress. We experimentally compared the effects of OA on two populations of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens), a marine mollusc important to fisheries and global aquaculture. Results from our experiments simulating captive aquaculture conditions demonstrated that abalone sourced from a strong upwelling region were tolerant of ongoing OA, whereas a captive-raised population sourced from a region of weaker upwelling exhibited significant mortality and vulnerability to OA. This difference was linked to population-specific variation in the maternal provisioning of lipids to offspring, with a positive correlation between lipid concentrations and survival under OA. This relationship also persisted in experiments on second-generation animals, and larval lipid consumption rates varied among paternal crosses, which is consistent with the presence of genetic variation for physiological traits relevant for OA survival. Across experimental trials, growth rates differed among family lineages, and the highest mortality under OA occurred in the fastest growing crosses. Identifying traits that convey resilience to OA is critical to the continued success of abalone and other shellfish production, and these mitigation efforts should be incorporated into breeding programs for commercial and restoration aquaculture.",10.1073/pnas.2006910117

This study deals with the possibility of using nacre fragments obtained from abalone shell for making a bulletproof armor system. A composite plate laminated with abalone shell fragments is made and compression and bend tests are carried out. In addition, a bulletproof test is performed with hybrid armor systems which are composed of an alumina plate, a composite plate, and aramid woven fabric to verify the ballistic performance of nacre. The compressive strength of the composite plate is around 258.3 MPa. The bend strength and modulus of the composite plate decrease according to the plate thickness and are about 149.2 MPa and 50.3 GPa, respectively, for a 4.85 mm thick plate.

In this study, three RNA isolation methods were tested to evaluate their usefulness in RNA isolation from various abalone tissues. Unlike the conventional method (method I), methods II and III included additional centrifugation and lithium chloride precipitation steps, respectively. RNA quality assessment based on the RT-PCR amplification of ribosomal protein L3 (RPL3) showed little difference in the quality of RNA isolated from muscle, regardless of the isolation method used. While RNA isolated from the hepatopancreas using methods I and II resulted in lower levels of RPL3 amplification, method III was found to be a more effective method of RNA extraction from the hepatopancreas, as indicated by a 30-60-fold increase in the RPL3 level. Competitive inhibition experiments using mixtures of RNA prepared by each method were performed to investigate which RT-PCR step was inhibited by materials present in the RNA preparation. An almost complete absence of RPL3 amplification was observed in RT-PCR with a cDNA template prepared from a mixture of RNAs containing a small amount of hepatopancreatic RNA isolated using method I. A drastic decrease in the incorporation of a fluorescence-labeled nucleotide into cDNA was also evident in the reverse transcription containing hepatopancreatic RNA isolated using method I. These results indicate a distinct inhibition of cDNA synthesis by materials present in the hepatopancreatic RNA preparation isolated using method I, but not present when method III is used. A competitive inhibition experiment was performed using mixtures of cDNA prepared from RNA isolated by each method to investigate whether the materials used in the preparation inhibited the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) step. The level of RPL3 amplification was proportional to the amount of cDNA prepared from hepatopancreatic RNA isolated using method III.

Different radical scavenging activities of the extracts from fermented H. discus hannai with C. militaris mycelia (FHCM) were assessed by electron spin resonance. The antioxidant potential of FHCM was also determined on the basis of a ferric reducing antioxidant power assay and 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethybenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging activity. Higher antioxidant and radical scavenging activities were observed in FHCM than in the unfermented C. militaris mycelia or H. discus hannai alone. FHCM demonstrated an anticancer activity against melanoma B16F10 cell line. In addition, FHCM co-treatment with doxorubicin showed an increased anticancer effect in both in vitro and in vivo.

In this study, abalone viscera hydrolysates (AVH) were prepared using Alcalase, Flavourzyme, Neutrase, and Protamex, and their oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) was evaluated. The AVH by Alcalase showed promising ORAC value, and further optimal enzyme/substrate hydrolysis condition for production of the AVH was determined. The AVH also exerted strong hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity, Fe2+ chelating activity, and reducing power. Furthermore, the AVH inhibited lipid peroxidation in a model system and protected hydroxyl radical-induced DNA damage. Amino acid profiles revealed that the AVH contained 57.1% antioxidant amino acids and 44.0% hydrophobic amino acids, which contributed to its higher antioxidant activity. In addition, the AVH showed cytoprotective effects against hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity of cultured hepatocytes, and significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and membrane lipid peroxidation. Taken all together, these results suggest that the AVH might be useful as an ingredient for functional foods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.jff.2015.04.023

Beginning in the early 1980s, commercial scale mariculture of abalone has involved 2 species: Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai Ino and the small tropical abalone, H. diversicolor Reeve. Intensive culture of H. d. hannai is distributed mainly in the northern China region, Liaoning and Shandong Provinces with an annual production increasing from about 47 nit (1992) to 4500 nit (2003). The small tropical abalone is the dominant species with a total production of H. diversicolor reaching 3878 mt produced in 2001 in Fujian. Guangdong and Hainan Provinces. Seeds for cultivation are exclusively produced from hatcheries with well-developed technology. Cultivation practices may vary widely among different sea types. Three major forms of grow-out are used in abalone cultivation, land-based tanks, suspended longline cages and intertidal ponds. Abnormal mortality has threatened sustainable development of the abalone industry from its inception. During 1992 to 1996, many facilities in the north ran at a loss due to mass mortality occurring in juveniles and seeds. Mortality usually occurred in the postsettlement nursery phase when spat remain on settlement plates, characterized by cease of dietary intake and falling from the substratum. The cause of this large-scale mortality remains as yet unknown. The same Situation occurred in Fujian front 1996, after 2 y of large-scale farming, and has already spread to all other provinces of abalone mariculture. Genetic improvement of abalone has drawn much attention. Hybridization between different populations from Japan and China has been achieved to obtain significant heterosis with growth and survival. Preliminary results on H. d. hannai have shown that survival of selective strains is significantly higher than normal controls.",

In addition, the activities of carbonic anhydrase and alkaline phosphatase, two enzymes implicated in calcium metabolism of vertebrates, were quantified. The CGRP circulating concentration increased progressively from the 3- to 7-cm-long abalone, whereas the mantle ir-CGRP strongly decreased in 5-cm-long abalone. Moreover, branchial carbonic anhydrase activity, a specific osteoclastic marker in vertebrates, increased during abalone development from 11.8 to 39 WA Units per mg of gill membrane proteins in 4- and 9-cm-long animals, respectively. Mantle alkaline phosphatase activity, a vertebrate specific osteoblastic marker, showed a twofold increase in 6-cm-long animals (8.11 Units per mg of proteins).

Various studies have suggested that this urchin outcompetes black-lipped abalone (Haliotis rubra) for resources, but experiments elucidating the mechanisms are lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings: We outline a new framework involving experimental manipulations and Markov chain and Pareto modelling to examine the effects of interspecific competition between urchins and abalone and the effect of intraspecific competition in abalone, assessed as effects on behaviour. Manipulations of abalone densities had no detectable effect on urchin behavioural transitions, movement patterns or resightability through time. In contrast, additions of urchins resulted in abalone shifting microhabitats from exposed to sheltered positions, an increase in the proportion of mobile abalone, and declines in abalone resightability through time relative to controls without the urchins. Our results support the hypothesis of asymmetrical competitive interactions between urchins and abalone. Conclusions/Significance: The introduction of urchins to intact algal beds causes abalone to flee and seek shelter in cryptic microhabitat which will negatively impact both their accessibility to such microhabitats, and productivity of the abalone fishery, and will potentially affect their growth and survival, while the presence of the abalone has no detectable effect on the urchin. Our approach involving field-based experiments and modelling could be used to test the effects of other invasive species on native species behaviour.",10.1371/journal.pone.0073477

Forty lactic acid bacterial strains (named Sgs1-40) were isolated from the intestinal tract and eight strains (named SgrnA-H) from the oesophagus-crop of snails. Several criteria were used to examine whether they may be applied as snail-specific for the screening of the presumptive probiotic bacterial strains. Principal Component Analysis using criteria such as the tolerance of these strains to the pedal mucus, gastric mucus, gastric juices and low pH, as well as the expression of the cell surface traits of hydrophobicity, biofilm formation and autoaggregation capacity revealed discrimination of twelve strains exhibiting presumptive in vitro probiotic properties. Injection of eight of these strains, which were identified as Lactobacillus plaraarum, in snail haemocoel increased the recruitment and phagocytic activity of amoebocytes in snail haemolymph. The Sgs14 and SgmB strains, exhibiting the highest immunostimulatory activity in haemolymph, were FITC-labelled and orally administrated to snails for ten days. The Sgs14 strain was able to adhere to intestinal mucosa of snails and stimulate the chemotactic and phagocytic activity of amoebocytes in haemolymph as well as the bactericidal activity of haemolymph serum. These responses are potentially mediated by the regulation of TLRs expression in the gut mucosa. These data indicate that the determination of properties such as snail mucus and gastric juice tolerance, cell surface traits for adhesion as well as increased chemotactic and phagocytic activity in snail haemolymph are eligible criteria to screen for snail-specific probiotics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that investigates the probiotic properties of gastrointestinal microflora of the terrestrial farmed snail Cornu aspersum maxima.",10.1016/j.fsi.2019.06.061

Statistically significant family by stocking density interaction was only found in SGR for TD. A certain degree of family-ranking inversions occurred in SGR for TD.

By combining field studies with epidemiologic tools, we evaluated the relationship between key factors impeding southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) population growth: disease and resource limitation. This threatened population has struggled to recover despite protection, so we followed radio-tagged sea otters and evaluated infection with 2 disease-causing protozoal pathogens, Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis neurona, to reveal risks that increased the likelihood of pathogen exposure. We identified patterns of pathogen infection that are linked to individual animal behavior, prey choice, and habitat use. We detected a high-risk spatial cluster of S. neurona infections in otters with home ranges in southern Monterey Bay and a coastal segment near San Simeon and Cambria where otters had high levels of infection with T. gondii. We found that otters feeding on abalone, which is the preferred prey in a resource-abundant marine ecosystem, had a very low risk of infection with either pathogen, whereas otters consuming small marine snails were more likely to be infected with T. gondii. Individual dietary specialization in sea otters is an adaptive mechanism for coping with limited food resources along central coastal California. High levels of infection with protozoal pathogens may be an adverse consequence of dietary specialization in this threatened species, with both depleted resources and disease working synergistically to limit recovery.",10.1073/pnas.0806449106

In a field experiment, biogenic habitat complexity was manipulated (presence or absence of foliose macroalgae) at two depths (2-3 m and 5-6 m) and the habitat-dependent effects on recruitment of the black foot abalone (Haliotis iris) were examined at three field sites along the south coast of Wellington, New Zealand (41A degrees 20'S, 174A degrees 47'E), between July and November 2005. Recruit density (< 5 weeks post-settlement) was measured on cobbles covered with crustose coralline algae. Habitats of low complexity (barrens treatments) had consistently greater densities of recruits than habitats of high complexity (algae treatments). However, recruits in algae habitats were larger, and for deep habitats, there was greater survival in algae habitats compared with barrens habitats. While depth had no significant effect on early recruit (< 2 weeks post-settlement) density, late recruit (< 5 weeks post-settlement) density was greater in shallow habitats, and so it seems recruit survival was greater in shallow habitats. In this experiment, algal habitat complexity had strong effects on early recruit abundance, but habitat-dependent variations in recruit growth and survival may modify initial patterns of abundance and determine recruitment to adult abalone populations.",10.1007/s00227-010-1576-4

Twenty eight C. acutispina were kept individually in a concrete tank with running seawater (10-28 degrees C) and fed mussels for sixteen months. Twenty one of them divided once or more during the experiment. Forty three underwent fission. One occurred from August to December when the water temperature was relatively high (>18 degrees C). Under controlled water temperature conditions, 90% of C. acutispina divided at temperatures > 19 degrees C, whereas only 7 % of them divided at temperatures < 13 degrees C. Fourteen sister pairs of two small individuals derived from one sea star by fission were kept under different nutritional conditions of either starved or fed mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) ad libitum for more than a year. The starved individuals never divided, while almost all the fed sea stars divided at least once.

The data are on a GIS database. Landsat 5 TM imagery could identify the presence of kelp beds, but only infrared aerial imagery and multispectral imaging at low spring tides accurately quantified surface areas of kelp beds.

In this study, we investigated the variation of taurine content in different seasons under two typical culturing systems in southern China. In addition, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 274 abalone array sequencing and phenotypic data of taurine content. The results revealed that the taurine content showed a trend of significantly decreasing and then increasing with seasonal changes. Individuals farmed in land-based industrial culture system had a greater taurine content than those farmed in sea-based floating raft culture system, with notable differences observed between May and September. A total of 69,530 high-quality SNPs and 274 individuals were identified by quality control.

Its high economic value and vulnerability to exploitation has triggered the interest in the development of its aquaculture. Significant progress has been made in recent years, with the establishment of artificial fertilization and larval production protocols. However, there are at least two major challenges that need to be addressed before a commercial production can be achieved: larval settlement and juvenile grow-out. The aim of this research was to study the effect of different algae substrates (Ulvella lens, Amphora sp., Entomoneis sp., Navicula salinicola and Nitzschia sp.) on P. aspera settlement and to test the effect of two diets on juvenile growth: a mono diet based on U. lens versus a mixed diet composed by U. lens and the diatoms Nitzschia sp. and Navicula salinicola. Results showed that U. lens was the most efficient settlement cue, given that 84.6% of the post-larvae obtained were found on this algae substrate. In the following trial, U. lens was selected as the base diet for the grow-out phase. The rearing system used ensured juvenile survival percentages above 80%. The regular supply of the diatom mixture, as a dietary supplement, significantly enhanced juvenile growth performance. After 220 days post fertilization, limpets that grew on the mixed diet (U. lens plus diatoms) presented an average shell length of 19.280 +/- 5.296 mm.

We evaluated the relationships between shell length (SL), shell width (SW) and body weight (BW, the total wet weight) in two different strains of Pacific abalone. One strain is 'Huangxun No. 1', which is from the fifth generation of a novel strain that has experienced higher shell growth rate selection, and the other strain is a first-generation descendant of wild Pacific abalone. The results of the correlation analysis showed that both SL and SW were significantly (p < 0.05) positively correlated with BW in both strains. Path analysis showed that SL significantly affected the BW of the 'Huangxun No. 1' strain, while SW significantly affected BW at only one of the four ages tested. Both SL and SW significantly affected the BW of the wild strain at the four ages tested. The determination coefficients of SL on BW in the 'Huangxun No. 1' strain at 3, 6, 13 and 19 months of age were 0.835, 0.141, 0.834 and 0.708, respectively, while those in the wild strain were 0.476, 0.237, 0.344 and 0.141, respectively. In addition, the SL/SW in the 'Huangxun No. 1' strain ranged from 1.453 to 1.509, while that of the wild-type strain ranged from 1.389 to 1.497. The allometric growth analyses showed positive allometric growth for 'Huangxun No. 1' from 3 to 19 months of age, while the wild strain did not show such growth. These results suggest that multiple generations of selection for a higher SL growth rate may have led to variation in shell morphological traits and that shell width may be a less important factor in determining body weight in the 'Huangxun No. 1' strain, while shell length can be used as an effective morphological trait for selective breeding to increase body weight.",10.1007/s10499-023-01281-7

Recent studies have detailed the sequencing of DNA extracted from shells up to thousands of years old and from various taphonomic and preservational contexts. However, previous approaches have largely addressed methodological rather than evolutionary research questions. Here, we report the generation of DNA sequence data from mollusc shells using such techniques, applied to Haliotis virginea Gmelin, 1791, a New Zealand abalone, in which morphological variation has led to the recognition of several forms and subspecies. We successfully recovered near-complete mitogenomes from 22 specimens including 12 dry-preserved shells up to 60 years old. We used a combination of palaeogenetic techniques that have not previously been applied to shell, including DNA extraction optimized for ultra-short fragments and hybridization-capture of single-stranded DNA libraries. Phylogenetic analyses revealed three major, well-supported clades comprising samples from: (1) The Three Kings Islands; (2) the Auckland, Chatham and Antipodes Islands; and (3) mainland New Zealand and Campbell Island. This phylogeographic structure does not correspond to the currently recognized forms.

In this study, after four months of culturing under blue light (NB), orange light (NY), dark environment (ND), and natural light (NN), the shell length and weight-specific growth rate in Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai, were ranked in the following order: NY > NN > ND > NB. To understand the growth differences in abalone under these different light en-vironments, we first performed 24-h video monitoring and found that the cumulative movement distance and duration were lowest in group NB, whereas the cumulative movement distance and duration were significantly higher in group ND than in any other group (P < 0.05). In group NB, the time spent hidden underneath the attachment substrate accounted for 81% of the resting time, but this ratio was lowest in group ND, at only 37% (P < 0.05). Next, LC-MS metabolomics identified 201 and 105 metabolites in NB vs. NN, ND vs. NN, and NY vs. NN under the positive and negative ion modes, respectively. According to the fold changes and annotations for differential metabolites in the KEGG enrichment pathways, adenosine, NAD+, cGMP, and arachidonic acid were used as differential metabolism markers, and the AMPK signaling pathway was enriched in every comparison group, and thus investigated further. The gene sequences of three subtypes of AMPK were obtained by cloning and we found that the expression levels of AMPK alpha and AMPK gamma, and the AMP content were significantly higher in group NB than in any other group (P < 0.05). In addition, the ATP contents and adenylate energy charge values were ranked in the following order: NY > NN > ND > NB. According to in situ hybridization analysis, the three subtype genes were widely expressed in the hepatopancreas. Finally, the contents of many lipid metabolites differed significantly among groups and the expression levels of the triglyceride hydrolysis-related gene hormone sensitive lipase and fatty acid oxidation-related gene carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 were higher in groups ND and NB than in groups NN and NY according to fluorescence quantification PCR (P < 0.05). The expression levels of fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase were significantly lower in groups ND and NB than in groups NN and NY (P < 0.05).

The 3T3 cells were exposed to the oxidant agent tert-butyl hydroperoxide and evaluated for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, in the presence or not of the recombinant enzymes. TAT-TrSOD-Yfp was able to decrease the generation of ROS by 15% when used in the concentrations of 3 and 6 mu mol/L in comparison to the control, but there was no difference in relation to the effect of TrSOD. Ab-TrSOD, when compared to TrSOD, promoted a decrease in the formation of ROS of 19% and 14% at the concentrations of 1 and 6 mu mol/L, respectively, indicating that this recombinant form was more effective in reducing oxidative stress compared to SOD without the cell-penetrating peptide (CPP). Together, these results indicate that the fusion of SOD with these CPP increased the antioxidant capacity of fibroblasts, identified by the reduction in the generation of ROS. In addition, such molecules, in the concentrations initially used, were not toxic to the cells, opening perspectives for the development of products for antioxidant protection of the skin that may have therapeutic and cosmetic application.",10.1002/bab.2314

Therefore, the inhibition of VM is crucial to the clinical treatment of tumors. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of a novel peptide, KVEPQDPSEW (AATP), isolated from abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) on HT1080 cells by migration, invasion analysis and the mode of action. The results showed that AATP effectively inhibited MMPs by blocking MAPKs and NF-B pathways, leading to the downregulation of metastasis of tumor cells. Moreover, AATP significantly inhibited VM and pro-angiogenic factors, including VEGF and MMPs by suppression of AKT/mTOR signaling. In addition, molecular docking was used to study the interaction of AATP and HIF-1, and the results showed that AATP was combined with an active site of HIF-1 by a hydrogen bond. The effect of AATP on anti-metastatic and anti-vascular in HT1080 cells revealed that AATP may be a potential lead compound for treatment of tumors in the future.",10.3390/md17040244

Field and laboratory studies have shown that the tropical species Haliotis asinina undergoes a two-week spawning cycle, thus providing an excellent opportunity to investigate the presence of endogenous spawning-associated peptides. In female H. asinina, we have isolated a peptide (5145Da) whose relative abundance in hemolymph increases substantially just prior to spawning and is still detected using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography chromatograms up to 1-day post-spawn. We have isolated this peptide from female hemolymph as well as samples prepared from the gravid female gonad, and demonstrated through comparative sequence analysis that it contains features characteristic of Kazal-type proteinase inhibitors (KPIs). Has-KPI is expressed specifically within the gonad of adult females. A recombinant Has-KPI was generated using a yeast expression system. The recombinant Has-KPI does not induce premature spawning of female H. asinina when administered intramuscularly. However it displays homomeric aggregations and interaction with at least one mollusc-type neuropeptide (LRDFVamide), suggesting a role for it in regulating neuropeptide endocrine communication. This research provides new understanding of a peptide that can regulate reproductive processes in female abalone, which has the potential to lead to the development of greater control over abalone spawning. The findings also highlight the need to further explore abalone reproduction to clearly define a role for novel spawning-associated peptide in sexual maturation and spawning.

The analysis showed that the CsTRx polypeptide contains a thioredoxin domain between Val(2) and Asn(106). The domain possessed a thioredoxin active family at 24-42 along with a redox active site (also known as catalytic center) at (31)WCGPC(35). The analysis showed that the catalytic center is responsible for the control of protein function. Phylogenetic study showed that CsTRx clustered together with vertebrate TRx-1. Based on the phylogenetic analysis and other bioinformatics analysis, it is confirmed that the characterized CsTRx belongs to TRx-1 family. In addition, the sub-cellular localization prediction analysis showed that CsTRx is a cytosol thioredoxin. The highest gene expression was observed in gill (P < 0.05). Further, its transcriptional modulation was evaluated under fungal (Aphanomyces invadans), bacterial (Aeromonas hydrophila) and H2O2 challenges. The recombinant CsTRx protein was over-expressed and purified using an Escherichia coli expression vector system. We conducted a H2O2 peroxidase assay using recombinant CsTRx protein under various pH and temperature. Further, we studied the influence of recombinant CsTRx protein on C striatus spleen leukocyte activation. The recombinant CsTRx protein enhanced the cell proliferation in a concentration dependant manner. The results of antioxidant analysis showed that the antioxidant capacity of recombinant CsTRx protein was determined to be 4.2 U/mg protein. We conducted an insulin disulfides assay to study the enzymatic oxidoreductase activity of CsTRx and we observed no activity in the control group. But the recombinant CsTRx protein addition rapidly increased the enzymatic oxidoreductase activity. Over all, the results showed that the CsTRx may contain potential antioxidant properties, which could regulate the oxidative stress created by various biological pathogens as well as chemical stress in the immune system of C striatus, thus protecting it.

White abalone are highly susceptible to withering syndrome, a fatal bacterial disease caused by Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis (CaXc), an intracellular, order Rickettsiales prokaryote that is endemic throughout the white abalone's range in California and Mexico. Oxytetracycline (OTC) baths at a dose of 500 mg/L are successful in clearing CaXc infections from the gastrointestinal tract of infected abalone. The impact of OTC treatment on the diversity and stability of the gut microbiome in white abalone is unknown. The objectives of this study were two-fold: (1) to characterize the gastrointestinal microbiome of clinically-normal white abalone and (2) to compare the gastrointestinal microbiomes of OTC-treated white abalone to those of control animals. Gastrointestinal tracts from five OTC-treated individuals and five untreated controls were sampled at each time point: day 0, one day after the 21-day OTC treatment (day 22), and at 203 days post-treatment. Gastrointestinal tract microbiomes were analyzed after amplification and sequence of the 16S rRNA. Gastrointestinal microbiomes of untreated animals were dominated by three core bacterial phyla: Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Reduced Shannon a-diversity and absence of various phyla in the microbiome of OTC-treated animals were observed in samples at day 22. Bacterial profiles were improved in terms of alpha-diversity at 203 days but some bacterial phyla, mainly Fusobacteria, remained absent. All animals remained clinically normal throughout the study period and there was no significant difference in a condition index between the two groups. OTC treatment for withering syndrome appears to be clinically safe in white abalone.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735411

This study explored the molecular effect of these fluctuations by exposing Sydney rock oysters, (Saccostrea glomerata), native to Australia, to either low salinity, elevated temperature or a combined salinity and temperature stress. Following the exposures, RNA-Seq was carried out on the collected oyster tissues. Differential transcript analysis resulted in a total of 1473, 1232 and 2571 transcripts, which were differentially expressed in S. glomerata exposed to low salinity (10 ppt), elevated temperature (30 degrees C) or the combined stressor (15 ppt and 30 degrees C), respectively, when compared to control oysters. All stress treatments had some effect on molecular processes such as innate immune response or respiration, with overall the strongest effects seen in S. glomerata exposed to the combined stressor. Additionally, most transporters putatively involved in osmoregulation were found to be suppressed in response to the combined stressor and the low salinity exposure. This study provides insight into the oyster's responses to both, single and dual stressors commonly found in an estuarine environment.",10.1016/j.margen.2018.10.003

Expression differences were observed in muscle samples from the four groups with 673 +/- 21.0 stained spots for H. discus hannai female x H. discus hannai male (DD), 692 +/- 25.6 for H. gigantea female x H. gigantea male (GG), 679 +/- 16.2 for H. discus hannai female x H. gigantea male (DG) (F-1 hybrid) and 700 +/- 19 for H. gigantea female x H. discus hannai male (GD) (F-1 hybrid). Different 2-DE image muscle protein spots had a mirrored relationship between purebreds and the F-1 hybrid, suggesting that all stained spots in F-1 hybrid muscle were on 2-DEs from parents. DD and DG clustered together first, and then clustered with GD, whereas the distance of DD and GG was maximal according to hierarchical cluster analysis. We identified 136 differentially expressed protein spots involved in major biological processes, including energy metabolism and stress response. Most energy metabolism proteins were additive, and stress-induced proteins displayed additivity or over-dominance. In these 136 identified protein spots, hybrid offspring with additivity or over-dominance accounted for 68.38%.

However, its production relies completely on hatchery-reared seed, and the survival in early stages, particularly during the settling process, is the main limitation for this activity to become cost effective. Thus, in order to assess the feasibility of improving survival of larvae and post-larvae of A. nucleus through genetic selection without affecting growth, it was estimated the heritability and the genotype-environment interactions for such traits, as well as the genetic correlations between them. These parameters were estimated based on intraclass correlations of 40 full-sib families (10 half-sib families) at 1, 11 and 75 days post fertilization. Heritability values were very high for the post-larvae survival (0.49), while it was low and not significant for larvae survival (<= 0.07) and medium to high for growth traits of larvae and post-larvae (> 0.3). The traits analyzed in post-larvae exhibited significant genotype-environment interactions in relation to culture depth in the sea. No significant genetic correlations between the measured traits were found. The results suggest the existence of an important genetic component in the variation of post-larval survival, and larval and post-larval growth, as well as a high potential response to direct genetic selection, especially for post-larval survival (50% increase per generation), without affecting the growth traits.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.06.047
"DIXON, FJ; JACOTGUI.H; MCCONAHEY, PJ",EFFECT OF PASSIVELY ADMINISTERED ANTIBODY ON ANTIBODY SYNTHESIS,1967,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE,125,6,1119,+,,"Suppression of the primary response of rabbits to intravenously ad-ministered KLH [keyhole limpet hemocyanin] can be achieved with very small amounts of hyperimmune anti KLH administered a day later since the rabbit apparently rapidly eliminates most of the KLH by non-immunologic means. The amount of passive anti KLH needed to achieve immunosuppression was directly proportional to the dose of injected antigen. Antibody passively administered as much as 6-8 days after antigen still can be strongly immunosuppressive, suggesting that the antibody must be reacting with immunogen in or on responding cells or perhaps in the process of transfer between cells. There was no evidence that the presence of passively admin-istered hyperimmune anti KLH prior to the injection of antigen had any immunosuppressive action beyond the direct neutralization of the injected antigen. When KLH was injected in Freund''s adjuvant, anti KLH incorporated with the KLH in the adjuvant was much more efficient in causing immunosuppression than was anti KLH given intravenously. The primary responses to 2 mg KLH given intraven-ously and 2 [mu]g given in adjuvant reached approximately equal peaks and were suppressible by comparable amounts of intravenously administered anti KLH. Two observations suggest that passive anti-body neutralizes the immunogenic stimulus at the level of individual antigenic determinants and not merely by aggregating or precipitating entire antigenic molecules. First, anti abalone hemocyanin (AH) which cross reacts approximately 50% with KLH was only partially immunosuppressive even in extremely large amounts, i.e., amounts which could react with and precipitate much more KLH than could the smaller but more suppressive doses of anti KLH. Second, when KLH and anti KLH were given together in adjuvant effective immuno-suppression was achieved only with amounts of anti KLH sufficient to saturate or cover virtually all available antigenic determinants. The immunosuppressive quality of passive antibody increases with time after immunization and with repeated immunization of the donor. In view of their relatively weak immunosuppressive properties, antibodies formed in the 1st weeks of a primary response may not contribute significantly to the turning off of the antibody response. In any event, results obtained by passive transfer of hyperimmune antibody to animals early in a primary response cannot be applied to the natural events in a primary response.",10.1084/jem.125.6.1119

In present study, various settlement and metamorphosis inducers at both the laboratory and scale-up experiments were investigated to determine their effects in inducing settlement and metamorphosis on the abalone Haliotis diversicolor supertexta. In lab experiment, results showed that both bacteria and diatoms colonized on the substrata could greatly enhance the larval settlement and metamorphosis, and larval settlement and metamorphosis could be induced by exposure to natural seawater supplemented with potassium chloride (KCl), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or KCl combined with GABA. Treatments supplemented with 5 mM KCl, 10 mM KCl, 10(-6) M GABA or some combinations can significantly enhance both the settlement and metamorphosis rates. And lower settlement and metamorphosis were induced by higher concentration up to 20 mM KCl or 5 x 10-6 M GABA, which indicated that high concentrations of KCl or GABA were toxic to abalone larvae. The combination of KCl and GABA did not appear positive synergy effects than that of single supplementation. Time course experiment demonstrated that supplementing time was critical to the stimulatory effects on larval settlement and metamorphosis. In scale-up experiment, larval metamorphosis rates at 10 days after fertilization were significantly promoted by exposure to KCl or GABA at low concentration level. The inducement effects were similar to the results at laboratory scale experiment. The results imply that these inducers could be applied on the production of abalone hatchery industry.

The library was screened with three separate serine proteinase gene fragments amplified from cDNA of H. glycines using consensus oligonucleotide primers. Each predicted protein contains a secretion signal sequence, a propeptide and a mature protein of 226-296 amino acids. One of the predicted enzymes, HGSP-II has 41% identity to a chymotrypsin-like enzyme from the mollusc, Haliotis rufescens, and analysis of key residues involved in substrate binding also suggests a chymotrypsin-like specificity. HGSP-I and HGSP-III show greatest homology to kallikreins but sequence analysis does not allow prediction of their substrate preferences. Southern blot analysis suggests that HGSP-II and HGSP-III are encoded by single-copy genes in contrast to HGSP-I which may have two or more homologues. The regions encoding the mature proteinases were cloned into an expression vector and recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli. Both HGSP-I and HGSP-II were shown, after refolding, to cleave the synthetic peptide N-CBZ-Phe-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin, and this activity could be inhibited by the cowpea trypsin inhibitor, CpTI. HGSP-III showed no activity against the synthetic substrates tested. The information gained from these studies indicates that serine proteinases are an important group of enzymes in H. glycines and further characterization will aid the development of a proteinase inhibitor-based approach for transgenic plant resistance to plant parasitic nematodes.

It is the major species of Gracilaria that is commonly cultivated and consumed in Taiwan. Effects of environmental factors on prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) production in the seaweed G. tenuistipitata were investigated in this study. PGE(2) amount increased nearly 2-fold and 47% when the seaweed was exposed to two ways of fluctuation of seawater salinity from 2% to 1% and 3% for 12 hr, respectively. The stresses of low temperature and irradiance promoted the seaweed to produce PGE(2). When the seaweeds were exposed to air for 2 hr and 4 hr, the PGE(2) levels were elevated by 25% and 31%, respectively. When the seaweed was soaked in freshwater, PGE(2) amount gradually decreased. Cu2+ and Zn2+ inhibited PGE(2) production at the concentrations of 3 and 50 mg/L, respectively. Mg2+ slightly inhibited PGE2 production about 20% at 2,025 mg/L, while Ca2+ boosted PGE(2) production about 59% at 600 mg/L. Hence, environmental factors significantly affect the PGE(2) production in the seaweed G. tenuistipitata. Prostaglandins might be associated with processes permitting the algae tissue to survive in unfavorable conditions. To lower the amount of PGE(2) in the seaweed and ensure the food safety, it is suggested to minimize the variation of growth condition to avoid PGE(2) increase in the seaweed during cultivation period. In addition, consumers should avoid eating raw seaweed since PGE(2) could be destroyed by heating.",
"Gorfine, HK; Taylor, BL; Walker, TI",Triggers and targets: What are we aiming for with abalone fisheries models in Australia,2001,JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH,20,2,803,811,,"A variety of quantitative measures have been applied as reference points in the management of Australian abalone fisheries. In New South Wales changes in legal-sized and mature biomass will trigger management responses, in South Australia catch rates, size composition, and abundance indices provide target reference points, and in Tasmania, catch rates and catches have been used to provide triggers for Management decisions. However, Victoria and Western Australia have yet to determine their reference points for abalone stock assessment. Victoria has been developing length-based fisheries models similar to those applied in New South Wales and is now confronted with the necessity of converting model outputs into decision-making criteria. A Victorian fishery management plan is also under development in which reference points will be specified within a risk-based matrix of catch control rules for quota adjustments, Recent biodiversity conservation legislation, compelling fisheries management agencies in Australia to demonstrate that export fisheries managed under their jurisdictions are ecologically sustainable, has increased the urgency to establish these reference points. The application of this legislation draws upon the Principles and Criteria for Sustainable Fishing of the Marine Stewardship Council in London, We considered a range of alternative measures for reference points that may be useful as triggers and targets applied in a stochastic framework for management decisions. Although not a modeling output, one of the more consistent nonbiological signals of localized depletion in the Victorian fishery relates to spatial allocation of effort at the scale of reef complexes. Reductions in annual effort applied to a particular reef system invariably precede significant decreases in abundance indices with typically large coefficients of variation and in catch rates characterized by hyperstability. Victorian abalone divers have high daily catch expectations and allocate their effort accordingly. Empirical reference points, such as effort allocations, provide utility for Fishery management and can be readily assimilated and adopted by industry. Consequently, we conclude that in addition to modeling outputs, maintenance of reef-scale effort allocation and daily catch expectations should form part of a suite of fishery performance indicators and target criteria for the Victorian blacklip abalone fishery.",

The species lives in burrows in living gastropod shells and was first discovered in 1993 in red abalone aquaculture facilities in southern California. Shell abnormalities in cultured abalones, caused by heavy sabellid infestations, raised concerns about its potential impact on native gastropods. The species has eight thoracic and three abdominal setigers, and is distinguished by the following features: 1) two pairs of radioles; 2) uncini in thoracic setigers 2-6 acicular, with main fang surmounted by small teeth, companion setae present; 3) uncini in thoracic setigers 7-8 avicular, with no main fang and teeth in a rasp-like (serpuliform) arrangement; 4) abdominal uncini acicular with main fang surmounted by small teeth. Members of T. heterouncinata are simultaneous hermaphrodites, with sperm produced in setiger 8 and oocytes in setigers 9-10. Sperm have an elongate nucleus and short midpiece. Young are brooded in the adult burrow to a late larval stage with about 6 setigers, but are nonfeeding, lacking a branchial crown. Released larvae crawl over the surface of the mollusc host shell and settle under the shell lip, in contact with the mantle tissue. Larvae are subsequently covered by shell from the host, forming the burrow, Crown formation and feeding commence after burrow formation. Cladistic analyses support the hypothesis that Terebrasabella is most closely related to Amphiglena, as part of the apomorphic Sabellinae clade, (Laonome (Terebrasabella, Amphiglena)). The early release of late-stage, non-feeding larvae, which enables the association of T. heterouncinata with gastropods,:appears to have been independently derived in this species as well as several Amphiglena species.",10.2307/3227007

Previous research demonstrated that the differential expression of a gene encoding a C-type lectin domain-containing protein (CTLD) was associated with a faster growth in Pacific abalone. We analyzed this gene and identified an open reading frame that consisted of 145 amino acids. The sequence showed a significant homology to other genes that encode CTLDs in the genus Haliotis. Expression profiling analysis at different developmental stages and from various tissues showed that the gene was first expressed at approximately 50 days after fertilization (shell length of 2.47 +/- 0.13 mm). In adult Pacific abalone, the gene was strongly expressed in the epipodium, gill, and mantle. Recombinant Pacific abalone CTLD purified from Escherichia coli exhibited antimicrobial activity against several Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus iniae, and Lactococcus garvieae) and Gram-negative bacteria (Vibrio alginolyticus and Vibrio harveyi). We also performed bacterial agglutination assays in the presence of Ca2+, as well as bacterial binding assays in the presence of the detergent dodecyl maltoside. Incubation with E. coli and B. subtilis cells suggested that the CTLD stimulated Ca2+-dependent bacterial agglutination. Our results suggest that this novel Pacific abalone CTLD is important for the pathogen recognition in the gastropod host defense mechanism.",10.3390/ijms23020698

However, the phylogenetic, and genomic and metabolic characteristics of these Deltaproteobacteria, and the nature of their relationship to abalone host remain elusive. Here, we examined the intestinal microbial composition of H. diversicolor using high-throughput sequencing and described the genomic characteristics of the Deltaproteobacteria phylotype using genome-centric metagenomics. High-throughput sequencing confirmed that one Deltaproteobacteria phylotype was predominant in intestinal microbiota of H. diversicolor. Phylogeny analysis based on full-length 16S rRNA gene allocated this bacterium to a distinct and unique cluster within SAR324. It possessed a genome of at least 1.59 Mb with 35.15 mol% GC content, much smaller than other sequenced free-living SAR324 bacteria. According to genome annotation and metabolic reconstruction, ATP binding cassette transporters for sugars and carbohydrate metabolism pathways indicated heterotrophic potential. Interestingly, it encoded polysaccharide lyases, which, if expressed, could help the host to digest its macroalgae diet. In contrast to the known SAR324, no sulphur oxidation or carbon fixation pathways were predicted. We propose that this is a unique and specific SAR324 bacterium in symbiosis with Haliotis.",10.1111/are.15043

Consequently, maintaining a sufficient number of separate families is often needed but costly and logistically difficult. Alternatively, parentage assignment can be obtained using DNA markers. We developed a panel of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for the European abalone Haliotis tuberculata using an existing transcriptomic resource. An initial set of 2,176,887 SNPs was filtered to select 500 for high throughput genotyping. Of these, 298 SNPs were amplified in at least 90% of our H. tuberculata samples, consisting of a mixed family cohort (945 offspring) generated by crossing 40 abalones, and 5 full-sib training families (70 offspring). Based on amplification success among parents, minimum allele frequency and checks carried out against the training families, a subset of 123 markers was used to carry out parentage assignment in our mixed family cohorts. Maximum likelihood and exclusion-based methods of parentage assignment yielded consistent results, allowing parentage to be assigned in 98.9% of the studied progeny. Optimization of markers suggests that the 60 most informative SNPs may be sufficient for 95% assignment success in these progeny. The panel was also used to estimate effective population size, and revealed a low N-e due to high variance of reproductive success between parents. Our panel could be used to estimate genetic parameters of traits in mixed family cohorts, an essential stage to initiate selective breeding in H. tuberculata. It could also be useful tool in the context of monitoring stock enhancement and population genetics studies.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.03.006

In this study, we identified a lipopolysaccharide- and -1,3-glucan-binding protein (LGBP) gene from the pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai (HDH), which is involved in the pattern recognition mechanism and plays avital role in the defense mechanism of invertebrates immune system. The HDH-LGBP cDNA consisted of a 1263-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 420 amino acids, with a 20-amino-acid signal sequence. The molecular mass of the protein portion was 45.5 kDa, and the predicted isoelectric point of the mature protein was 4.93. Characteristic potential polysaccharide binding motif, glucanase motif, and -glucan recognition motif were identified in the LGBP of HDH. We used its polysaccharide-binding motif sequence to design two novel antimicrobial peptide analogs (HDH-LGBP-A1 and HDH-LGBP-A2). By substituting a positively charged amino acid and amidation at the C-terminus, the pI and net charge of the HDH-LGBP increased, and the proteins formed an -helical structure. The HDH-LGBP analogs exhibited antibacterial and antifungal activity, with minimal effective concentrations ranging from 0.008 to 2.2 g/mL. Additionally, both were toxic against human cervix (HeLa), lung (A549), and colon (HCT 116) carcinoma cell lines but not much on human umbilical vein cell (HUVEC). Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis showed that HDH-LGBP analogs disturb the cancer cell membrane and cause apoptotic cell death.

Infected abalone are characterised by multifocal areas of necrosis of the epithelium, underlying muscle fibres and connective tissues of the foot, epipodium and mantle. The lesions are typically 2-3 mm in diameter and contain numerous hyphae. Affected aquaculture facilities have suffered significant production losses, with up to 90% mortality among spat and up to 30% mortality among older animals. The pathogen has been identified as Halioticida noduliformans Muraosa, Morimoto, Sano, Nishimura and Hatai, 2009 from the morphological characteristics, the physiological characteristics that were investigated and molecular analysis of the large subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU rRNA) gene. Although the optimum temperature for growth of the fungus was 20-25 degrees C. it grew at a wide range of temperatures (10-25 degrees C). No growth occurred at 5 and 30 degrees C. The fungus grew well in peptone yeast glucose saline (PYGS) agar containing 50-100% seawater, with optimum growth occurring in full strength seawater (-35 ppt salinity). No vegetative growth was observed on PYG agar without seawater or supplemented exclusively with varying concentrations (0-5%) of NaCl.

Meanwhile, edible Pleurotus abalonus as a member of Abalone mushroom family is a popular nutritional supplement that purportedly prevents cancer occurrence. However, these anecdotal claims are supported by limited studies describing tumor-inhibitory responses to the promising polysaccharides, and the molecular mechanisms underlying these properties have not yet been elucidated. Methodology/Principal Findings: We here fractionated the crude polysaccharide preparation from the fruiting bodies of P. abalonus into three fractions, namely PAP-1, PAP-2 and PAP-3, and tested these fractions for antiproliferative activity in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. The largest PAP-3, an acidic polysaccharide fraction with a molecular mass of 3.68x10(5) Da, was the most active in inhibiting MCF-7 cancer cells with an IC50 of 193 mu g/mL. The changes in cell normal morphology were observed by DAPI staining and the PAP-3-induced apoptosis was confirmed by annexin V/propidium iodide staining. The apoptosis was involved in mitochondria-mediated pathway including the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m), the increase of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, caspase-9/3 activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) degradation, as well as intracellular ROS production. PAP-3 also induced up-regulation of p53, and cell cycle arrest at the S phase. The incubation of MCF-7 cells with antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly attenuated the ROS generation and apoptosis caused by PAP-3, indicating that intracellular ROS plays a pivotal role in cell death. Conclusions/Significance: These findings suggest that the polysaccharides, especially acidic PAP-3, are very important nutritional ingredients responsible for, at least in part, the anticancer health benefits of P. abalonus via ROS-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. It is a major breakthrough bringing new insight of the potential use of the polysaccharides as health-care food or medicine to provide significant natural defense against human cancer.",10.1371/journal.pone.0064266

This is a pattern typical of abalone species globally. However, movement may produce clustered distributions that promote fertilization success in broadcast spawners, such as abalone, even at low regional densities. We translocated wild, adult pink abalone Haliotis corrugata to an existing pink abalone patch to create a high-density aggregation, and then used acoustic telemetry to characterize abalone movement and monitor aggregation maintenance for a period of 14 mo in the Point Loma kelp forest near San Diego, California. Abalone showed a minimal flight response to handling that did not differ between the resident or translocated groups. Most individuals exhibited small home ranges (median area 183 m(2)) and homing behavior consisting of regular back-and-forth movement to a single point. Nomadic movement was also observed in several individuals. Though site fidelity may help maintain aggregations, abalone density decreased, and nearest neighbor distances increased at our site to near-initial levels after 18 mo via a combination of mortality, large movements of a few individuals, and small, incremental movements of most individuals. No coordinated movements that would suggest spawning behavior were observed. Translocation of wild abalone to produce aggregations may not result in high rates of fertilization success that promote population recovery. However, the homing behavior observed may provide more opportunities for mating than expectations based on static measures of density and aggregation state.",10.3354/meps10365

It functions as a cell survival protein that reduces that ability of a cell to undergo mitochondrial apoptosis. However, the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax is mainly effective in CLL, despite the expression of its protein target in NHL. We hypothesized that other mechanisms are inhibiting apoptosis in NHL: defects in pro-apoptotic signaling and/or the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins other than BCL2. Our study makes use of a technique known as BH3 profiling, which is a functional assay that determines the apoptotic competency of cells on primary NHL samples. By determining how cells in NHL avoid apoptosis upon exposure to venetoclax, we can identify patients who may benefit from additional therapies and potentially improve the response of drugs currently undergoing clinical trials for NHL. To determine causes of apoptotic resistance, we analyzed 124 primary B cell NHL samples using BH3 profiling, a technique that measures the mitochondrial permeabilization upon exposure to synthetic BH3 peptides. Our cohort included samples from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high-grade B cell lymphoma with translocations in MYC and BCL2 (HGBL-DH), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). While a large number of our samples displayed appropriate responses to apoptosis-inducing peptides, pro-apoptotic functional defects, implicating BAX, BAK, BIM or BID, were seen in 32.4% of high-grade NHLs (12/37) and in 3.4% of low-grade NHLs (3/87, p < 0.0001). The inhibition of single anti-apoptotic proteins induced apoptosis in only a few samples, however, the dual inhibition of BCL2 and MCL1 was effective in 83% of samples, indicating MCL1 was the most common cause of lack of response to the BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax. We then profiled Toledo and OCI-Ly8 high-grade lymphoma cell lines to determine which drugs could reduce MCL1 expression and potentiate venetoclax responses. Doxorubicin and vincristine decreased levels of MCL1 and increased venetoclax-induced apoptosis (all p < 0.05). Overall, in primary NHLs expressing BCL2 that have no defects in pro-apoptotic signaling, a poor response to venetoclax is primarily due to the presence of MCL1, which may be overcome by combining venetoclax with doxorubicin and vincristine-based chemotherapy or with other anti-microtubule inhibitors.",10.3390/cancers13051002

Seed production of Pacific abalone differs between northern and southern China and is dependent on sufficient quantities of broodstock, excess quantities of freshly cultured diatoms during the nursery phase, and tank hygiene and newly designed attachment methodology during the intermediate culture phase. Innovations in grow-out systems for Pacific abalone, such as stock enhancement in northern regions and commercial application of cage culture methods in southern regions, have further contributed to the success of Pacific abalone farming in China. There are still challenges in Pacific abalone-farming industry in China. First, mass mortality during the nursery and postlarval culture stages hinders seed production in northern and southern regions. Second, extreme weather events, including cold waters in northern regions and typhoons and red tides in southern regions, have occurred more frequently during recent years, and these events often cause high mortality of adult abalone during the grow-out phase. Finally, Pacific abalone H. discus hannai is an introduced species from northern regions, and, therefore, summer mortality remains a major problem in most bays of southern China; moreover, the survival rate from seed to market size varies widely among growing areas.

Selenium is known for its role in antioxidant defense, whereas copper is a redox-active metal capable of acting as a pro-oxidant. We investigated the effects of short term selenium (Na2SeO3) supplementation (4 mu g/L for 3 days) on antioxidant parameters of the blue mussel. Mytilus edulis, and its possible protective effects against a subsequent copper (CuSO4) exposure (56 mu g/L for 3 days). Selenium supplementation caused a 4-fold increase in glutathione levels in gills. The activity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase was modulated by selenium in gills (2-fold increase) and also in cell-free haemolymph (40% increase). Copper exposure produced decreases in protein thiol levels (35%) and in thioredoxin reductase activity (60%) in gills and induced an increase in DNA damage in haemocytes (70% increase in % tail DNA observed using the comet assay). The decrease in thioredoxin reductase activity may constitute a mechanism of copper toxicity in bivalves, warranting further investigation. Pre-treatment with selenium largely prevented these deleterious effects of copper on protein thiols, thioredoxin reductase activity and DNA damage. The results suggest that induction of key antioxidant defenses such as glutathione and selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase, as a result of selenium supplementation, may play an important role in protection of aquatic organisms against oxidative stress.

We used pure blacklip (Haliotis rubra) and greenlip (Haliotis laevigata) abalone, as well as their hybrid, to test whether differences in movement and/or aerobic versus anaerobic energy use are linked to a purported increased growth rate in hybrids. Abalone were acclimated to control (16 degrees C) and typical summer temperatures (23 degrees C), each with oxygen treatments of 100% air saturation -(O(2)sat) or 70% -O(2)sat. The experiment then consisted of two phases. During the first phase (chronic exposure), movement and oxygen consumption rates (.O2) of abalone were measured during a 2 day observation period at stable acclimation conditions. Additionaly, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and tauropine dehydrogenase (TDH) activities were measured. During phase two (acute exposure), -O2sat was raised to 100% for abalone acclimated to 70% -O(2)sat followed by an acute decrease in oxygen to anoxia for all acclimation groups during which movement and.O-2 were determined again. During the chronic exposure, hybrids and H. laevigata moved shorter distances than H. rubra. Resting.O2, LDH and TDH activities, however, were similar between abalone types but were increased at 23 degrees C compared to 16 degrees C. During the acute exposure, the initial increase to 100% -O(2)sat for individuals acclimated to 70% -O(2)sat resulted in increased movement compared to individuals acclimated to 100% -O(2)sat for hybrids and H. rubra when compared within type of abalone. Similarly,.O-2 during spontaneous activity of all three types of abalone previously subjected to 70% -O(2)sat increased above those at 100% -O(2)sat. When oxygen levels had dropped below the critical oxygen level -(Pcrit), movement in hybrids and H. laevigata increased up to 6.5-fold compared to movement above -Pcrit. Differences in movement and energy use between hybrids and pure species were not marked enough to support the hypothesis that the purportedly higher growth in hybrids is due to an energetic advantage over pure species.",10.1007/s00360-021-01388-4

Transition between these morphologically and ecologically distinct phases typically occurs when the developmentally competent larva comes into contact with a species-specific environmental cue. This cue acts as a morphogenetic signal that induces the completion of the postlarval/juvenile/adult developmental program at metamorphosis. The development of competence often occurs hours to days after the larva is morphologically mature. In the non-feeding - lecithotrophic - larvae of the ascidian Herdmania curvata and the gastropod mollusc Haliotis asinina, gene expression patterns in pre-competent and competent stages are markedly different, reflecting the different developmental states of these larval stages. For example, the expression of Hemps, an EGF-like signalling peptide required for the induction of Herdmania metamorphosis, increases in competent larvae. Induction of settlement and metamorphosis results in further changes in developmental gene expression, which apparently is necessary for the complete transformation of the larval body plan into the adult form.",

The mice were intraperitoneally injected with the extracts from the midgut glands of cultured scallops Patinopecten yessoensis gathered in early spring in Funka Bay, Hokkaido, Japan. The injections induced atypical symptoms in the mice within 24 h. The symptoms included piloerection, substantial eye discharge, swelling of the ears and head, and ear scratching. They were similar to those reported in studies of photosensitivity caused by pyropheophorbide in the midgut glands of abalones, which are herbivorous gastropods. The problematic scallops also accumulated a large amount of pyropheophorbide-a. The amount determined with high-performance liquid chromatography was 300-530 mu g per 1 g of the homogenate of the midgut glands. The dose of pyropheophorbide sufficient to cause photosensitivity in a mouse is estimated to be 0.99-2.3 mg per mouse with 20-g body weight. Moreover, comparative tests in mice showed that the onset of the symptoms required light and a substantial amount of pyropheophorbide.

Histological (hematoxylin-eosin) and histochemical (PAS Alcian Blue, Sudan Black, Dahl's) tools were used to determine variations in the glycogen index, lipid index, and calcium coverage index of mantle tissue as a function of seasonality (cold and warm period) and body region (dorsal, central, ventral). Anatomically, only two well-developed and functional mantle folds (inner and outer) were observed across the marginal zone, together with a poorly developed, and presumably, rudimentary fold with the same cellular morphology as the inner fold. The inner mantle epithelium stored significantly higher concentrations of glycogen and mucins, triglycerides, and calcium than the outer epithelium. This pattern occurred significantly more during the cold season than during the warm season. Mucins from mantle tissue not only regulate crystal nucleation and orientation during biomineralization, but also give the inner nacreous layer its luster and color. High concentrations of lipids in mantle tissue could help compensate for the energy loss caused by the wound-healing processes associated with mantle tissue removal and seeding, which are stressful and energetically costly. The absorption of calcium ions from the environment to integrate a microlaminate of calcareous compounds gives the shell its structural properties of hardness and strength. An approach with molecular-ultrastructural tools is recommended to broaden the understanding of mantle tissue regionalization and its relationship to pearl sac formation, which may help increase pearl yield and quality in H. rufescens.",10.2983/035.043.0107

H. amussitatum is a dominant species on exposed crustose coralline algae (CCA) along the Sanriku coast in northeastern Japan, and it has been Suggested that it competes for food with postlarval abalone. The minimum densities of the gastropod required to inhibit the growth of diatoms were estimated to be < 10 g/m(2) at 20 degrees C, between 10-20 g/m(2) at 15 degrees C, and > 20 g/m(2) at 7 degrees C. In the absence of grazing pressure, Nitzchia sp. and Psamodictyon panduriformis. which have a growth form classified as Type A (gliding prostrate type), initially formed flat communities. Amphora sp., Cocconeis sublittoralis (Type B: adhesive prostrate type) and Tabularia investiens (Type C: nonmotile upright type) Subsequently increased in number. The two species of Type A were significantly affected by grazing pressure and did not increase even at a gastropod density of 10 g/m(2) at 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C. Types B and C diatoms were more tolerant of grazing by the gastropod than Type A species. However. the volumetric rate of ingestion of Cocconeis scutellum (Type B) by the gastropod was almost the same as for Novicula britannica (Type A) at the three experimental temperatures, when they were supplied to the gastropod independently. The digestion efficiencies of C. scutellum and N. britannica were 94.7% and 2.2%, respectively. The dietary value of C. scutellum for the gastropod H. amussitatum is thus considerably higher than that of N. britannica. In the natural CCA habitat, competitive grazing by H. amussitatum on the diatom Cocconeis spp., which is known as a major food for postlarval abalone, could significantly affect the survival and growth rates of postlarval abalone.",

More efficient production strategies are necessary to ensure a sustainable mariculture sector, yet the potential of feasible production gains without further environmental impacts is largely unknown. This work took one of the biggest mariculture centers in China to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of mariculture products in 2003, 2010, and 2016, explore potential factors associated with resource use efficiency, and quantify the potential of these factors to increase regional production. The mariculture sector had a rapid expansion in 2003-2010 and accelerated product diversification in 2010-2016, with overall annual growth rates of 4.6%, 24.9%, 14.6%, 20.4%, 24.7%, and 8.7% in finfish (Larimichthys crocea and others), sea cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus), abalone (Haliotis spp.), laminaria (Laminaria japonica), gracilaria (Gracilaria spp.), and porphyra (Porphyra spp.) production, respectively. Resource use impacts were dominated by finfish production (over 90% of the total), but recent increases were mostly due to the farming of other products. Our study also identified several demographic (household size), socioeconomic (income per capita), technical (farming density, feed usage, and energy usage), and environmental (distance between farms and total nitrogen concentration) variables that were correlated with resource use efficiency. Simulations based on regression models suggested that changes in these factors could increase fish and seaweed production by at least 3%-18% and 2%-23%, respectively, without increasing resource use levels. Sustainable intensification of local mariculture systems could be achieved by enhancing the access to more efficient technology and financial capital, increasing the willingness of engagement in the sector, facilitating the transaction of sea use rights, reducing the amount of nutrient released in coastal areas, and including the heterogeneous effects of farm distances and water quality in marine spatial planning. Our results highlight the existing opportunities in policymaking for more sustainable food production systems and the management of coastal ecosystems in mariculture-dominated seascapes.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.130743

Unlike the coatings obtained at remelting temperatures of 1150 degrees C and 1230 degrees C, where the sigma phase is a Mo poor phase, the coating obtained at the remelting temperature of 1190 degrees C has a Mo-rich phase.

In contrast, knowledge about how the interactions between water temperature and diet affect the gut microbiota of marine invertebrates that do not thermoregulate is much less studied. In the present study, the effect of elevated seawater temperature and diet (Isochrysis zhanjiangensis and Platymonas helgolandica var. tsingtaoensis) on the gut microbial community of the commercial mussel, Mytilus coruscus, was investigated. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to characterize the microbial community in M. coruscus gut. The mortality of M. coruscus exposed to a high water temperature (31 degrees C) increased after 3 days and the diversity of the bacterial community in the gut of live M. coruscus was significantly reduced. For example, the abundance of Bacteroides (Bacteroidetes) and norank_Marinilabiaceae (Bacteroidetes) increased in the gut of M. coruscus fed I. zhanjiangensis. In M. coruscus fed P. helgolandica, the abundance of Arcobacter (Proteobacteria) and norank_Marinilabiaceae increased and the abundance of unclassified_Flavobacteriaceae (Bacteroidetes) decreased. The results obtained in the present study suggest that high temperatures favored the proliferation of opportunistic bacteria, including Bacteroides and Arcobacter, which may increase host susceptibility to disease.

Candidate genes and wholeexomes were sequenced in relapse tumor biopsies to search for molecular correlates, and these data were used to quantify circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in serial plasma samples. Eleven of 40 patients (28%) responded to panobinostat (95% confidence interval [CI] 14.6-43.9) and rituximab did not increase responses. The median duration of response was 14.5 months (95% CI 9.4 to not reached). At time of data censoring, 6 of 11 patients had not progressed.

The decision tree was designed to cope with existing data limitations and to ensure that localized meta-population dynamics were adequately considered in decision-making. It was also necessary to balance the potential for localized abundance changes with the practical issue of implementing fishery regulations at larger spatial scales. The MSE demonstrated that undesirably low stock sizes could be avoided while also continuing to maintain a viable fishery, even under environmental conditions that are detrimental to abalone populations. Under less-severe environmental conditions, stock size was maintained, on average, above the biomass associated with production of maximum sustainable yield.

Chemotactic and phagocytic ability (percent phagocytosis, %P; and phagocytic index, PI), as well as gross morphological characteristics, of hemocytes withdrawn from red (Haliotis rufescens) and black abalone (H. cracherodii) after in vivo exposure to 25, 35, or 45 parts per thousand seawater salinity plus 1.2 mg/l PCP were determined. Abalone exposures of 3.5 and 6.5 h, respectively, were based on species-specific metabolic endpoints (MEPs) derived from previous NMR data. Hemocyte chemotaxis was found to be augmented by low salinity in red but not black abalone, while high salinity seemed to reduce chemotactic ability in both species. PCP did not potentiate the effects demonstrated by salinity variations alone in red abalone, although chemotaxis was further compromised in black abalone exposed to high salinity stress combined with PCP. Although chemotactic ability was similar among both species, both %P and PI was greater among black abalone. Low salinity may offset the effects of PCP in red but not black abalone. Whereas red abalone demonstrated a reduction in phagocytic ability upon exposure to high salinity alone, black abalone appeared more resilient to high salinity stress alone. Furthermore, while the effect of high salinity plus PCP is subadditive among red abalone, high salinity seems to potentiate the effect of PCP on black abalone, Finally, hemocytes exposed to acute salinity variations plus PCP showed varying morphological characteristics when compared to controls. Over 30% of hemocytes of high salinity plus PCP exposed abalone remained rounded and generally unattached to glass slides with only a few pseudopod extensions. Hemocyte preparations incubated in rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin were observed with fluorescence microscopy and reveal an altered actin filament pattern. Overall, black abalone demonstrate greater phagocytic ability than red abalone both in the presence and absence of PCP. Furthermore, increases in salinity are accompanied with reduced phagocytic ability with red abalone demonstrating particular sensitivity to salinity variations. While PCP inhibits ATP synthesis, salinity variations may impose an additional stress on intertidal animals exposed to transient or seasonal environmental changes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Furthermore, AGSP reduced the disease activity index and intestinal damage, improved the mucosal immune response, and inhibited oxidative damage in mice with DSS-induced acute and chronic colitis, which can be associated with modulation of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway and gut microbiota. AGSP regulated the structure of the gut microbiota and reduced the level of Bacteroides that had positive correlation with the colitis symptoms. The in vitro result showed that AGSP may inhibit mucin degradation by Bacteroides via the change of the polysaccharide utilization strategy, which can protect intestinal barrier integrity. This study is useful to understand the mechanism by which AGSP ameliorates colitis and related diseases and promotes further development of AGSP.",10.1039/d1fo02431k

However, Vibrio spp. infections have caused a great economic loss in Pacific white shrimp culture industry. The immune responses of Pacific white shrimp to the Vibrio spp. is not fully characterized. In this study, the transcriptomic profiles of L. vannamei hemocytes were explored by injecting with or without Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Totally, 42,632 high-quality unigenes were obtained from RNAseq data. Comparative genome analysis showed 2258 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) following the Vibrio challenge, including 1017 up-regulated and 1241 down-regulated genes. Eight DEGs were randomly selected for further validation by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and the results showed that are consistent with the RNA-seq data. Due to the lack of predictable adaptive immunity, shrimps rely on an innate immune system to defend themselves against invading microbes by recognizing and clearing them through humoral and cellular immune responses. Here we focused our studies on the humoral immunity, five genes (SR, MNK, CTL3, GILT, and ALFP) were selected from the transcriptomic data, which were significantly up-regulated by V. parahaemolyticus infection. These genes were widely expressed in six different tissues and were up-regulated by both Gram negative bacteria (V. parahaemolyticus) and Gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus). To further extend our studies, we knock-down those five genes by dsRNA in L. vannamei and analyzed the functions of specific genes against V. parahaemolyticus and S. aureus by bacterial clearance analysis. We found that the ability of L. vannamei was significantly reduced in bacterial clearance when treated with those specific dsRNA. These results indicate that those five genes play essential roles in antibacterial immunity and have its specific functions against different types of pathogens. The obtained data will shed a new light on the immunity of L. vannamei and pave a new way for fighting against the bacterial infection in Pacific white shrimp.",10.1016/j.fsi.2018.03.030

Chondrus canaliculatus is a red alga endemic to the temperate Pacific coast of South America and produces a complex carrageenan. In Chile, this potential marine resource has been underutilized since the early 1990s, after it was replaced mainly by imports of Kappaphycus and Eucheum from Asia. The study of the cultivation of C. canaliculatus in outdoor tanks demonstrates the potential to produce large quantities of algal material due to the high productivity observed. The material produced may be important in Chile as feed for cultured algal herbivores such as Haliotis spp. Data were obtained on the key factors affecting the growth of this alga, including light, temperature, and nutrient concentrations. The results showed that, on a dry weight basis, productivity varied seasonally between 40 g m(-3) wk(-1) in autumn and 200 g m(-3) wk(-1) in spring, and the optimal stocking density in our experiments was 8 kg m(-3). Effects of self-shading were among the most important limiting factors in the culture.

The species is on a decline due to depletion of forest cover, predation by natural enemies, and collection. To facilitate the conservation of the species, it is important to decide on a number of traits related to growth, immunity and reproduction addressing fitness advantage of the species.ResultsThe visceral mass transcriptome of I. fruhstorferi was enabled using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencing platform. According to BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) method, the transcriptome was considered complete with 91.8% of ortholog genes present (Single: 70.7%; Duplicated: 21.1%). A total of 96.79% of the raw read sequences were processed as clean reads. TransDecoder identified 197,271 contigs that contained candidate-coding regions. Of a total of 50,230 unigenes, 34,470 (68.62% of the total unigenes) annotated to homologous proteins in the Protostome database (PANM-DB). The GO term and KEGG pathway analysis indicated genes involved in metabolism, phosphatidylinositol signalling system, aminobenzoate degradation, and T-cell receptor signalling pathway. Many genes associated with molluscan innate immunity were categorized under pathogen recognition receptor, TLR signalling pathway, MyD88 dependent pathway, endogenous ligands, immune effectors, antimicrobial peptides, apoptosis, and adaptation-related. The reproduction-associated unigenes showed homology to protein fem-1, spermatogenesis-associated protein, sperm associated antigen, and testis expressed sequences, among others. In addition, we identified key growth-related genes categorized under somatotrophic axis, muscle growth, chitinases and collagens. A total of 4822 Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) were also identified from the unigene sequences of I. fruhstorferi.ConclusionsThis is the first available genomic information for non-model land slug, I. fruhstorferi focusing on genes related to growth, immunity, and reproduction, with additional focus on microsatellites and repeating elements. The transcriptome provides access to greater number of traits of unknown relevance in the species that could be exploited for in-depth analyses of evolutionary plasticity and making informed choices during conservation planning.

The effect of depuration and the optimum dose of antimicrobial agents for sterilisation of mantle tissue in abalone mantle tissue culture and their effects in cell yield have not been reported with reference to cell proliferation and its survival. Abalone cell culture is being given importance in order to develop a technology for in-vitro pearl production, as the cultured pearls are highly valuable in terms of high quality. Separate studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of depuration and to standardise the optimum dose of antimicrobial agents. Mantle tissue from depurated and non-depurated abalones (Haliotis varia) was used simultaneously to study the effect of depuration in cell yield. During the study, contamination was found to be more in depurated tissues than in non-depurated ones. Role of antibiotics such as streptomycin and penicillin on cell proliferation and contamination was studied by washing tissues using solutions containing three different doses of antibiotics, prior to initiation of culture. In the first experiment, washing of tissue in seawater containing 1000 mu g ml(-1) of streptomycin and 2000 IU ml(-1) of penicillin yielded more cell proliferation with less contamination. Fungizone was incorporated along with streptomycin and penicillin to minimise the fungal contamination in the second experiment.

Pressurization at 200 MPa caused a decrease in pH and shear force compared to those in the control but thereafter increased with increasing pressure levels. Water holding capacity (WHC) of abalone decreased when pressurized at >400 MPa. A greater reduction in shear force was observed after 1 week of storage. For color, reduction in the a* value of abalone was considerable during storage. Increasing pressure suppressed the generation of total volatile basic nitrogen compounds and total viable counts, whereas lipid oxidation occurred with increasing pressure. Pressurization at 200 MPa was the optimum pressure condition in which the shelf-life of abalone was extended to about 10 days compared to 3 days in the control. Industrial relevance: For the use of high pressure as a pasteurization technique, commercial system is required not to exceed 5 min of holding time for the system maintenance purpose. In addition, this process is carried out under ambient temperature for the economical aspect. The abalone which is normally consumed as raw state in East Asia has very short shelf-life (<3 days) during chilled storage, hence increasing the shelf-life for 7-8 days has been challenged for commercial distribution of the abalone. This study provided one of the strategies to extend shelf-life of abalone with minimal quality changes by high pressure processing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Whitaker, AR; Byrd, BF",Boat-based foraging and discontinuous prehistoric red abalone exploitation along the California coast,2012,JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY,31,2,196,214,,"Temporally and spatially discontinuous pulses of heavy prehistoric exploitation of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) have been documented along the southern and central California coast. This article examines the very late (post-950 cal BP) appearance of numerous red abalone processing sites on the Monterey Peninsula in central California. We test three prominent explanations offered for the sudden onset of red abalone processing sites: trophic cascades resulting from human predation on sea otters, logistical foraging by inland residents, and changes in sea surface temperature. A trophic cascade appears to have occurred but does not fully explain the nature or timing of the phenomenon in the region. We present an alternative explanation that argues that intensive procurement of red abalone emerged at a time when both population pressure and social complexity increased greatly in central California. We argue that a new exploitation strategy-diving from boats-was employed to exploit a much larger portion of the red abalone habitat. This strategy entailed logistical forays by divers who worked new patches in tandem with boaters, gathered large quantities in a single foray, and then field processed them in bulk on the shore before transporting the meat to coastal residences. This strategy provided an additional source of food, and both tradable dried meat and numerous large shells that could be manufactured into ornaments and traded as decorative accoutrements. We conclude our discussion with a consideration of the factors that created such a discontinuous record of red abalone exploitation along the California coast. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Bacteria isolated from the healthy abalone intestine belonged to the genera Vibrio, Flammeovirga, Shewanella, Persicobacter and Paraferrimonas. From the 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis, the intestinal bacterial community comprised two groups: the Proteobacteria and Tenericutes. Betaproteobacteria (18.48%), Deltaproteobacteria (30.43%) and Mollicutes (35.87%) were the most dominant components in the clones and the Mollicutes were mainly Mycoplasma-affiliated clones. The DGGE band pattern demonstrated that more bands appeared in the healthy abalones (H group) than in the diseased abalones (D group). Although few potential pathogens were detected from the D group, a clustering dendrogram indicated that individuals of the H and D groups (except for D6) formed two separate clusters.

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), GABA analogs, and GABA-mimetics associated with certain crustose coralline algae (CCA), are known to induce larval settlement in commercial abalone (Haliotis) species, and other gastropods. Furthermore, mucus secreted from these gastropods has been shown to induce larval settlement, but the stimulatory components of mucus have not been thoroughly investigated. We now present data confirming that GABA is the settlement-inducing effector molecule contained within abalone mucus. To do this, we initially generated anti-GABA for use in immunoenzyme and immunofluorescent microscopy. Using these techniques GABA was identified in the nerves and epithelial cells of the foot, including mucus. Dried mucus samples subject to HPLC analysis revealed a mean concentration of 0.68 mM GABA after sample rehydration. The presence of GABA in these samples was confirmed by time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (TOF-MS). In addition, GABA was detected in the mucus of several abalone species and other gastropods by immunocytochemistry. Subsequent bioassays using both dry and fresh mucus strongly promoted induction of larval settlement. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.jembe.2007.11.003

The study was carried out based on five abalone sites using electrophoresis analysis. Allozyme data for seven loci from individuals within abalone sites were obtained, and F statistics were used to assess population structure. Allozyme variation was low, but more similar than the one reported in other haliotids. Malate dehydrogenase (MDH-1 and MDH-2) and glutamate oxalate transaminase (GOT) in some population were fixed. There were not observed significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium among 31 comparisons made over all loci and all populations. F statistics did not indicate departure from random mating or evidence of genetic structuring of the H. fulgens populations, however F-IT and F-IS data showed that inbreeding occurs inside abalone sites. Additionally, cluster analysis and Mantel tests showed that genetic differences among abalone populations were not accumulative geographically. Data do not suggest that H. fulgens populations are genetically isolated from one another. The five populations formed a homogeneous group respect to allele frequencies at six of the seven loci analyzed. Therefore, they cannot be considered as different stocks. The results suggest that gene flow along the distribution of abalone banks could be variable depending of the coastal topography, dominant swells. and driving winds, which determine the local coastal hydrodynamic and consequently the level of larval interchange among populations.",

A previous researcher discovered that seawater extracts of mud from juvenile habitats could induce metamorphosis and provided evidence that the inductive agent was of biological origin. Because juvenile L obsoleta are herbivorous and grow when fed diets of benthic diatoms, we hypothesized that benthic diatoms or their associated microflora might be responsible for producing a metamorphic stimulus. We tested extracts of a culture of mixed diatoms and extracts of cultures of 6 diatom species isolated from mudflat sediments along the coast of North Carolina in which sexually mature and immature adult (juvenile) L obsoleta commonly co-occur. We also tested extracts of one diatom culture isolated at the Friday Harbor Laboratories (Friday Harbor, WA). We found differential effects among the diatom species tested. One centric diatom, Coscino-discus sp., induced metamorphosis at levels close to those triggered by a known neuroactive compound, serotonin. Several species of benthic diatoms displayed neutral effects, showing little or no inductive capability. In one experiment, an unidentified pennate diatom species appeared to inhibit spontaneous metamorphosis that occurred in some competent larvae. We hypothesize that Coscinodiscus sp. or its associated microflora, is part of a suite of benthic species that is either indicative of a favorable juvenile environment or is itself part of the post-metamorphic diet. Our results also indicate that larval Ilyanassa demonstrated positive, neutral, and perhaps even negative responses to potential metamorphic cues. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, the addition of antioxidants of bamboo leaves mitigated heat-treatment-induced protein oxidation, aggregation and increased hydrophobicity, and consequently improved abalone muscle protein digestibility and transport levels.",10.1039/d1fo03389a

In marine organisms and habitats, microbiome research is limited. In Australia, abalone aquaculture is an economically important industry; however, little is known about the relationship between abalone and their microbiome. This study investigated the intestinal microbiomes of hybrid, or Tiger, (Haliotis laevigata x H. rubra) and greenlip (Haliotis laevigata) abalone over a one-year production period, grown at two commercial farms. Abalone samples (n = 30 for each species) were collected every three months, for a total of five sampling periods, mimicking seasonal change (i.e. Autumn, Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn) for each farm. The intestinal samples were sequenced (16S rRNA gene, Illumina MiSeq) and the intestinal microbiomes were analysed. The intestinal microbiomes of hybrid and greenlip abalone were dominated by four genera: Psychrilyobacter, Vibrio, Mycoplasma, and to a lesser extent Formosa. The dominance of the digestive tract by four genera (>= 88%) indicates that the abalone gut is a niche environment with unique selective pressures. The intestinal microbiomes were significantly impacted by the sampling date, which is associated with seasonal changes and abalone age.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.736245

A focus of this research has been the nacreous inner layer of the shell with its conspicuous arrangement of aragonite platelets, resembling in cross-section a brick-and-mortar wall. In comparison, the outer, less stable, calcitic prismatic layer has received much less attention. One of the first molluscan shell proteins to be characterized at the molecular level was Lustrin A, a component of the nacreous organic matrix of Haliotis rufescens. This was soon followed by the C-type lectin perlucin and the growth factor-binding perlustrin, both isolated from H. laevigata nacre, and the crystal growth-modulating AP7 and AP24, isolated from H. rufescens nacre. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics was subsequently applied to to Haliotis biomineralization research with the analysis of the H. asinina shell matrix and yielded 14 different shell-associated proteins. That study was the most comprehensive for a Haliotis species to date. Methods: The shell proteomes of nacre and prismatic layer of the marine gastropod Haliotis laevigata were analyzed combining mass spectrometry-based proteomics and next generation sequencing. Results: We identified 297 proteins from the nacreous shell layer and 350 proteins from the prismatic shell layer from the green lip abalone H. laevigata. Considering the overlap between the two sets we identified a total of 448 proteins. Fifty-one nacre proteins and 43 prismatic layer proteins were defined as major proteins based on their abundance at more than 0.2% of the total. The remaining proteins occurred at low abundance and may not play any significant role in shell fabrication. The overlap of major proteins between the two shell layers was 17, amounting to a total of 77 major proteins. Conclusions: The H. laevigata shell proteome shares moderate sequence similarity at the protein level with other gastropod, bivalve and more distantly related invertebrate biomineralising proteomes. Features conserved in H. laevigata and other molluscan shell proteomes include short repetitive sequences of low complexity predicted to lack intrinsic three-dimensional structure, and domains such as tyrosinase, chitin-binding, and carbonic anhydrase. This catalogue of H. laevigata shell proteins represents the most comprehensive for a haliotid and should support future efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of shell assembly.",10.1186/s12953-018-0139-3

LPS (5mg/kg body weight) produced hepatic damage that was manifested by significant increases in the activities of marker enzymes (aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase) and reduced antioxidant (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, malondialdehyde) activities. These antioxidant activities were elevated by HDE administration to LPS-treated rats. These results suggested that HDE extracts had a potential hepatoprotective effect in LPS-induced liver damage without any acute toxicity. In addition, reducing power of the extracts and their ability to scavenge free radicals were evaluated by applying DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS [2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt].

Within species, however, the allometry between mortality rates and body mass has received substantially less attention and the consistency of such scaling patterns at the intra-specific level is controversial. We reviewed 73 experimental studies to examine the relationship between mortality rates and body size among seven species of abalone (Haliotis spp.), a marine herbivorous mollusk. Both in the field and in the laboratory, log-transformed mortality rates were negatively correlated with log-transformed individual body mass for all species considered, with allometric exponents remarkably similar among species. This regular pattern confirms previous findings that juvenile abalones suffer higher mortality rates than adult individuals. Field mortality rates were higher overall than those measured in the laboratory, and the relationship between mortality and body mass tended to be steeper in field than in laboratory conditions for all species considered. These results suggest that in the natural environment, additional mortality factors, especially linked to predation, could significantly contribute to mortality, particularly at small body sizes. On the other hand, the consistent allometry of mortality rates versus body mass in laboratory conditions suggests that other sources of mortality, beside predation, are size-dependent in abalone.",10.1007/s00442-011-2163-1

The effects of asparagus straw substrate on yield, polysaccharides content and antioxidant properties of these two mushrooms were studied. On non-supplemented asparagus straw substrate, the yield of P. geesteranus (199g/bag) was significantly higher than that of P. abalones (140g/bag) while the polysaccharides content of P. abalones was significantly higher than that of P. geesteranus. Addition of appropriate amounts of glucose, MgSO4 and K2HPO4 to the substrate increased the mushroom yield of P. geesteranus significantly. Addition of saccharides and inorganic salts to the substrate had no remarkable effect on the polysaccharides content of P. geesteranus fruit bodies, whereas caused the significant decrease of the polysaccharides content of P. abalones fruit bodies compared with the control. According to the scavenging effect on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicals and reducing power of ethanolic extracts from two mushrooms, it was shown that the antioxidant properties of P. abalones was superior to that of P. geesteranus on non-supplemented asparagus straw substrate, and the supplementation of sucrose + MgSO4 to the substrate was favorable to the enhancement of antioxidant activity of two mushrooms.

Gastropod molluscs have proved to be particularly useful foci for such studies, but the developmental expression of FaRPs and the evolution of specific transcripts for different peptides are unclear within the molluscs. Here we show that FaRPs are encoded by two transcripts that appear to be splice variants of a single gene in the abalone, Haliotis asinina, which represents the basal vetigastropods. Has-FMRF1 comprises 1,438 nucleotides and encodes a precursor protein of 329 amino acids that can potentially produce two copies of FLRFamide, one copy each of TLAGDSFLR-Famide, QFYRIamide, SDPDLDDVIRASLLAYSLDDSPNN, and SVATAPVEAKAVEAGNKDIE, and 13 copies of FMRFamide. The second 1,241-nucleotide transcript, Has-FMRF2, encodes a 206-amino acid precursor protein with single copies of FLRFamide and FMRFamide along with such extended forms as NFGEPFLRFamide, FDSYEDKALR-Famide, and NGWLHFamide, in addition to SDPGEDMLK-SILLRGAPSNNGLQY and DTUDETTUNDNAHSRQ. Both transcripts are present early in life and are expressed in different but overlapping patterns within the developing larval nervous system. Mass spectrometry and immunocytochemistry demonstrate that FaRPs are cleaved from larger precursors and localize to the developing nervous system. Our results confirm previous evidence that FaRPs are expressed early and potentially play many roles during molluscan development and suggest that the last common ancestor to living gastropods used alternative splicing of an FMRFamide gene to generate a diversity of FaRPs in spatially restricted patterns in the nervous system.

This matrix consists of chitin and different proteins that may affect the morphology and the crystal structure of the developed platelets. The organic matrix can be divided into two fractions: the soluble and the insoluble matrix. The soluble matrix has influence on the precipitation rates of calcium carbonate crystals and also the insoluble matrix affects crystal growth. In this work we investigated the collective influence of soluble and insoluble matrix in a crystallization device which contained the insoluble matrix and was flowed through by CaCl2 and NaHCO3 solutions. The presence of 0.02 mu g/mL soluble matrix promoted the growth of flat CaCO3 crystals on the surface layers of the insoluble matrix of Haliotis laevigata. The crystals could be identified as aragonite using electron diffraction in the transmission electron microscope (TEM). Furthermore the addition of 1 mu g/mL soluble matrix inhibited largely crystal growth on the surface of the insoluble matrix. Our findings indicate that components of the soluble matrix are required for a controlled nucleation and growth of flat aragonite crystals on the insoluble matrix.",10.1021/cg101240e

The sequence of 41 amino acids was determined by Edman degradation supported by mass spectrometry. The most abundant amino acids were cysteine ( 19.5%), histidine ( 17%), and arginine ( 14.6%). The positively charged amino acids were almost counterbalanced by negatively charged ones resulting in a calculated isoelectric point of 7.86. Atomic- force microscopy studies of the interaction of the protein with calcite surfaces in supersaturated calcium carbonate solution or calcium chloride solution showed that the protein bound specifically to calcite steps, inhibiting further crystal growth at these sites in carbonate solution and preventing crystal dissolution when carbonate was substituted with chloride. Therefore this protein was named perlinhibin. X- ray diffraction investigation of the crystal after atomic- force microscopy growth experiments showed that the formation of aragonite was induced on the calcite substrate around holes caused by perlinhibin crystal- growth inhibition. The strong interaction of the protein with calcium carbonate was also shown by vapor diffusion crystallization. In the presence of the protein, the crystal surfaces were covered with holes due to protein binding and local inhibition of crystal growth. In addition to perlinhibin, we isolated and sequenced a perlinhibin- related protein, indicating that perlinhibin may be a member of a family of closely related proteins.",10.1529/biophysj.106.100636

From a Haliotis cDNA library, we have isolated and sequenced a cDNA clone which encodes the five C-terminal FUs d, e, f, g and h of HtH2. As shown by multiple sequence alignments, defg of HtH2 correspond structurally to defg from Octopus dofleini hemocyanin. HtH2-e is; the first FU of a gastropod hemocyanin to be sequenced.

This data allows, for the first time, an insight into the evolution of the two functionally different hemocyanin isoforms found in marine gastropods. It appears that they evolved several hundred million years ago within the Prosobranchia, after separation of the latter from the branch leading to the Pulmonata.

Recently, interest in molluscan immunity has increased due to their phylogenetic position and importance in worldwide aquaculture and aquatic environment. As the main aquaculture animal, most molluscs live in the water environment and they have to cope with many pathogen challenges, in which virus is one of the primary causes for the mass mortality. In vertebrates, interferon (IFN) system is generally recognized as the first line of defence against viral infection, while the antiviral mechanisms in molluscs remain to be clearly illuminated. Recently, some IFN-like proteins and IFN-related components have been characterized from molluscs, such as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), IFN-like receptors, JAK/STAT and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which reinforce the existence of IFN-like system in molluscs. This system can be activated by virus or poly (I:C) challenges and further regulate the antiviral response of haemocytes in molluscs.

However, interactions with other important local and global drivers such as ocean acidification, eutrophication and sedimentation, and the physiological mechanisms via which MHWs act on species are poorly understood. Additionally, past studies have often focused on ecologically dominant taxa such as kelps, fucoids and coral, potentially leading to a lack of understanding of direct impacts on associated species. To this end, we examined the individual and interactive impacts of MHW duration (14 and 28 days) and intensity (20.5 degrees C and 23 degrees C) as well as irradiance (2.3 and 4.4 mol m(-2) d(-1)) on standardized growth of Caulerpa brownii, Corallina berteroi and Phymatolithopsis complex, three temperate macroalgal taxa that are important spaceholders in their native ecosystem in Te Whanganui a Tara Wellington, Aotearoa New Zealand. All three taxa exhibited no declines in growth in response to the exposure to longer and more intense MHWs. We posit that the simulated MHW scenarios were tolerated due to large thermal safety margins which can be expected from the range centre/leading edge position of the sampled populations, even though some of these scenarios far exceeded the intensities encountered in this region previously. Interactions between intensity, duration and irradiance were limited to an antagonistic irradiance-duration interaction in the non-calcareous green macroalga Ca. brownii only.

AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH A 13C-ENRICHED AMINO ACID,2012,JOURNAL OF MOLLUSCAN STUDIES,78,,100,104,,"Many marine gastropod species brood their embryos in thin-walled capsules to protect them during development. Despite its beneficial effects, encapsulation has two major constraints, nutrition and oxygen supply, which affect embryo development and larval survival. Developing embryos usually rely on intracapsular food sources provided by the mother, in the form of yolk, nurse eggs and intracapsular fluid. However, it is still not clear if they are able to feed on extracapsular sources that may cross the capsule wall. We investigated this possibility in the calyptraeid species Crepidula fornicata. In this species, the internal capsule wall thickness sharply decreases during embryonic development, which might change wall permeability to small organic molecules, thus providing embryos with external dissolved organic matter. To test this hypothesis, encapsulated and excapsulated embryos of C. fornicata were placed for 48 h in a C-13-enriched amino acid (L-alanine) solution. Excapsulated embryos were enriched in C-13 (+5.75%), which suggested that they were able to assimilate the labelled amino acid.

A coastal conifer forest covered highlands of Santa Rosa during the last glacial, but by ca. 11 800 cal. a BP Pinus stands, coastal sage scrub and grassland replaced the forest as the climate warmed. The early Holocene became increasingly drier, particularly after ca. 9150 cal. a BP, as the pond dried frequently, and coastal sage scrub covered the nearby hillslopes. By ca. 6900 cal. a BP grasslands recovered at both sites. Pollen of wetland plants became prominent at Soledad Pond after ca. 4500 cal. a BP, and at Abalone Rocks Marsh after ca. 3465 cal. a BP. Diatoms suggest freshening of the Abalone Rocks Marsh somewhat later, probably by additional runoff from the highlands. Introduction of non-native species by ranchers occurred subsequent to AD 1850.

This research focuses on northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana) in Haida Gwaii, the home of the Haida Nation. The Haida have developed a range of values associated with abalone, including reciprocity. However, commercial fishing and colonial mismanagement have led to overexploitation, resulting in a prohibition on all gatherings since 1990. Despite this, the relationship between the Haida and abalone persists in the community's knowledge. We used the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) framework and the concept of reciprocal contributions to help paint a complex relationship between Haida knowledge holders and abalone, identifying values, benefits, drivers and barriers. We identified food uses and meanings that include emotional experiences. Additionally, we compiled an array of reciprocal contributions, such as enhancement actions, fishing guidelines and nature protection practices. These memories and guidelines have been passed down through generations. The principle of 'take only what you need to eat' is essential for managing abalone populations. Reciprocal actions have been crucial for both abalone and the Haida. Elders have transplanted abalone to other sites, and the Council of the Haida Nation continues monitoring and restoration work. Cultural and ecological education about abalone is preserved through family stories, school activities and ceremonies, reinforcing its status as a culturally important species. The abalone fishing boom and Canadian mismanagement were identified as negative drivers that significantly impacted abalone populations. Most Haida elders recall their efforts in the 1970s to raise concerns with the federal fishing agency about the declining abalone population, but their warnings went unheeded. Currently, due to limited enforcement capacity, abalone poaching is the primary concern, while bureaucratic hurdles in decision-making processes impede effective assessment and management. This work contributes to reviewing the past and rethinking management strategies in local contexts where values like reciprocity remain integral to Indigenous people. It also aims to generate dialogues and actions with international fisheries platforms, facilitating learning from other local experiences and recognizing common colonial barriers worldwide.

In many places, overfishing has led to the decimation of wild stocks and many are now reared in aquaculture systems. In the Azores, there is no tradition of eating abalones and Haliotis tuberculate stocks are still virtually untouched. However, as tourism in the islands grows and the stocks of other shellfish diminish, there is an increasing pressure to find alternative edible resources, leading to a rising interest in abalones. According to previous studies performed in the region, other edible species, including the local highly appreciated limpets and the giant barnacle, present high concentration levels of some heavy metals, which has been attributed to the volcanic origin of the islands. Here we analysed the metal content in the edible tissue of Haliotis tuberculate from Sao Miguel Island, Azores. The potential human health risks due to its consumption was assessed by estimating the average daily intake (EDI) and target hazard quotient (THQ) of metals. Similarly to other organisms in the Azores, abalones have higher than normal levels of some heavy metals, particularly cadmium, reflecting a local natural source that should be closely monitored from a public health point of view.

To monitor for contamination of QdNOS in abalone and assess dietary exposure, a simple and reliable analytical method for the detection of QdNOs and their major metabolites was developed. Results This work is the first to present a simple and fast pretreatment procedure coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography tandem positive-mode electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for tracing of major metabolites of QdNOs in abalone. Extraction steps were simplified by the use of methanol and ethyl acetate containing 0.1% formic acid instead of more complicated acidolysis and enzymolysis pretreatment procedures. High-sensitive characters were obtained with limits of detection ranged from 0.16 to 2.1 mu g kg(-1) for QdNOs and their major metabolites.

The quality properties of baked abalone (150-210 A degrees C, 10-30 min) with and without pre-tenderization treatment prior to baking were evaluated through sensory evaluation, textural analysis and Hunter Lab colorimeter. In addition, amounts of sugars and alpha-dicarbonyl compounds in these products were determined via HPLC analyses. The baking condition at 180 A degrees C for 20 min combined with pre-tenderization resulted in an optimal product. The baked abalone with pre-tenderization had better textural properties (hardness, 1031.12 +/- 101.67; springiness, 0.96 +/- 0.02; chewiness, 817.13 +/- 113.43; shear, 2843.92 +/- 35.67), sensory scores (30.1 +/- 2.9) and color (25.28 +/- 1.21) as compared to the baked abalone without pre-tenderization (hardness, 1990.91 +/- 252.35; springiness, 0.87 +/- 0.01; chewiness, 1164.43 +/- 195.64; shear, 3910.79 +/- 302.12; sensory score, 17.4 +/- 1.0; color, 15.91 +/- 0.74). The reducing sugar analysis indicated the presence of ribose and glucose in the baked abalone. In addition, the formation of alpha-dicarbonyl compounds (degraded from reducing sugars) including glucosone, 3-deoxyglucosone, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and diacetyl were significantly promoted by the tenderization process in the baked abalone muscle. And the tenderization treatment led to an average of 218% increase in alpha-dicarbonyl compounds in the baked abalone muscle. The promotion of the formation of alpha-dicarbonyl compounds by the tenderization treatment contributed to the accumulation of pigments in the final baked products and led to desirable color.",10.1007/s11694-018-9765-9

Osteoblastic cells were treated with the highly reducing sugar, dRib, in the presence or absence of CZE. Cell viability, apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were subsequently examined. It was observed that dRib reduced cell survival, while it markedly increased the intracellular levels of ROS and apoptosis. However, pre-treatment of the cells with CZE attenuated all the dRib-induced effects. The antioxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), also prevented dRib-induced oxidative cell damage. In addition, treatment with CZE resulted in a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and collagen content, as well as in the expression of genes associated with osteoblast differentiation [ALP, collagen, osteopontin (OPN), osteoprotegerin (OPG), bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteocalcin (OC) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)2, BMP4 and BMP7]. In mechanistic studies of the antioxidative potential of CZE, we found that CZE reversed the dRib-induced decrease in the expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT)1 and AKT2 genes, which are master regulators of survival-related signaling pathways. CZE also upregulated the gene expression of the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD)2, SOD3 and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), which was inhibited by dRib. Taken together, these results suggest that CZE attenuates dRib-induced cell damage in osteoblastic cells and may be useful for the treatment of diabetes-associated bone disease.",10.3892/ijmm.2013.1371

The simulation was conditioned on the properties of blacklip abalone and its fishery on the east coast of Tasmania. Abalone are well known for exhibiting spatial heterogeneity in their biological properties. Each population in the simulation was represented by a size-based population dynamics model and had biological properties of growth, maturation, emergence from crypsis, and mortality specific to each population; the range of these properties varies to different degrees in the different quota zones around Tasmania. The simulation was used to compare the effects of applying different legal minimum length (LML) regulations on the fishery. Because of spatial heterogeneity in growth, a single LML within a zone has always been a compromise between underprotecting some populations and overprotecting others. The simulation was used to determine the protection afforded the overall mature biomass and the variation likely among different populations, and how these populations then responded to exploitation. In addition, when setting an LML within a zone, an analysis was made, using the simulation, of the potential trade-offs between the total allowable catch (TAC), the number of abalone needed to take that TAC, the proportion of the mature biomass protected by the LML, and the stock depletion level after fishing with different LMLs but the same TAC.",10.2983/035.032.0126

The study was composed of two experiments. In the first, we compared sheltering between two groups of 100 individuals each reared in either natural or artificial seawater. For 15 days, a score was assigned every day to the position occupied by each individual, i.e. 0 when it was out of the hide, 1 when it was on the bottom of the maintenance tank underneath the hide, and 2 when it occupied the inner spot of the hide. Our results show that artificial seawater significantly affects sheltering: only the individuals reared in natural seawater were able to reach the hide and maintain a position in it. Chemical analyses revealed that artificial seawater differed from natural seawater for a relatively low concentration of Ca2+. In the second experiment we compared H. tuberculata's sheltering behavior in three media, natural, artificial, and calcium-enriched artificial seawater. Sheltering was restored in enriched artificial seawater, which supports the hypothesis that calcium has an effect on this species' behavior. However, calcium concentration both in the artificial and natural water showed a progressive decrease with time likely due to the absorption by abalones, which suggests that in closed systems calcium supply is constantly required, even when the used medium is natural seawater.

As climate change alters ocean conditions, the dispersal of these larvae will be affected, with pervasive ecological and evolutionary consequences. We review the impacts of oceanic changes on larval transport, physiology, and behavior. We then discuss the implications for population connectivity and recruitment and evaluate life history strategies that will affect susceptibility to the effects of climate change on their dispersal patterns, with implications for understanding selective regimes in a future ocean. We find that physical oceanographic changes will impact dispersal by transporting larvae in different directions or inhibiting their movements while changing environmental factors, such as temperature, pH, salinity, oxygen, ultraviolet radiation, and turbidity, will affect the survival of larvae and alter their behavior. Reduced dispersal distance may make local adaptation more likely in well-connected populations with high genetic variation while reduced dispersal success will lower recruitment with implications for fishery stocks. Increased dispersal may spur adaptation by increasing genetic diversity among previously disconnected populations as well as increasing the likelihood of range expansions. We hypothesize that species with planktotrophic (feeding), calcifying, or weakly swimming larvae with specialized adult habitats will be most affected by climate change. We also propose that the adaptive value of retentive larval behaviors may decrease where transport trajectories follow changing climate envelopes and increase where transport trajectories drive larvae toward increasingly unsuitable conditions. Our holistic framework, combined with knowledge of regional ocean conditions and larval traits, can be used to produce powerful predictions of expected impacts on larval dispersal as well as the consequences for connectivity, range expansion, or recruitment. Based on our findings, we recommend that future studies take a holistic view of dispersal incorporating biological and oceanographic impacts of climate change rather than solely focusing on oceanography or physiology. Genetic and paleontological techniques can be used to examine evolutionary impacts of altered dispersal in a future ocean, while museum collections and expedition records can inform modern-day range shifts.",10.1002/ecs2.3015

The mussel, Mytilus californianus, is used by the starfish as the main source of food in regions of mussel beds, and 2 barnacles, Balanus glandula and Tetraclita squamosa rubescens, are main food sources in regions not suitable for Mytilus growth. Mytilus and/or barnacles form approximately 80% of Pisaster''s diet in these areas. In areas where neither barnacles nor mussels are abundant, Pisaster turns more to gastropods and chitons and tends to be less dependent on any 1 particular species.

We addressed this question using a knockin mouse line expressing cyclic adenosine monophosphate-insensitive HCN4 channels. This mouse line displayed a complex cardiac phenotype characterized by sinus dysrhythmia, severe sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses and chronotropic incompetence. Furthermore, the absence of CDR leads to inappropriately enhanced heart rate responses of the SAN to vagal nerve activity in vivo. The mechanism underlying these symptoms can be explained by the presence of nonfiring pacemaker cells. We provide evidence that a tonic and mutual interaction process (tonic entrainment) between firing and nonfiring cells slows down the overall rhythm of the SAN. Most importantly, we show that the proportion of firing cells can be increased by CDR of HCN4 to efficiently oppose enhanced responses to vagal activity. In conclusion, we provide evidence for a novel role of CDR of HCN4 for the central pacemaker process in the sinoatrial node. The involvement of cAMP-dependent regulation of HCN4 in the chronotropic heart rate response is a matter of debate. Here the authors use a knockin mouse model expressing cAMP-insensitive HCN4 channels to discover an inhibitory nonfiring cell pool in the sinoatrial node and a tonic and mutual interaction between firing and nonfiring pacemaker cells that is controlled by cAMP-dependent regulation of HCN4, with implications in chronotropic heart rate responses.",10.1038/s41467-020-19304-9

This 'arms race' may be characterized by the selection for new variant hosts and new variant parasites. Here we discuss the utility of phylogenetics in detecting adaptive evolution at the molecular level and, for illustration, we concentrate on a family of surface-exposed proteins (the rifins) found in the recently sequenced genome of Plasmodium fialciparum. We employed phylogeny-based methods in order to characterize adaptive evolution in these proteins. We found evidence for adaptive evolution in many of the amino acid residues in at least one lineage. These results indicate that there has been selection for those strains of P. fialciparum that contain the new genotypes. These proteins are likely to be of great importance for the survival of the parasite. Studies of the interaction of these proteins with the antigen-presenting cells of the immune system should lead to a better understanding of malarial infection.",

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the differences between the wild-type and cultivated G. lemaneiformis. Here, 648 up-regulated and 837 down-regulated proteins were screened using the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technique, and these differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were concentrated in the pathways including Ribosome, Photosynthesis-antenna proteins, alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism, and Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.

Hdh-Lustrin A has characteristic cysteine- and proline-rich domains, glycine- and serine-rich domains, and a whey acidic protein (WAP)-like C-terminus. The cysteine- and praline-rich domains showed internal similarity repeats that arrayed in gene coding region, and the phylogenetic tree of these repeats indicated that the similarity of structural repetitive unit components in different abalone species, reflecting their evolutionary distance. A tissue distribution analysis showed that the mRNA level of Hdh-Lustrin A has tissue-specific expression in mantle.

Moreover, acidification and warming raised the expression level of Hdh-Lustrin A in shell regeneration in two different manners; acidification raised the gene expression in quick response, in contrast the long run in warming treatment. Similar pattern also has been detected in immune reaction and the thermal treatments.

However, the dynamics that underlie the emergence of disease outbreaks in marine ecosystems still lack the equivalent level of description, conceptual understanding, and modeling context routinely present in the terrestrial systems. Here, we propose a theoretical basis for modeling the transmission of marine infectious diseases (MIDs) developed from simple models of the spread of infectious disease. The models represent the dynamics of a variety of host-pathogen systems including those unique to marine systems where transmission of disease is by contact with waterborne pathogens both directly and through filter-feeding processes. Overall, the analysis of the epizootiological models focused on the most relevant processes that interact to drive the initiation and termination of epizootics. A priori, systems with multi-step disease infections (e.g., infection-death-particle release-filtration-transmission) reduced dependence on individual parameters resulting in inherently slower transmissions rates. This is demonstrably not the case; thus, these alternative transmission pathways must also considerably increase the rates of processes involved in transmission. Scavengers removing dead infected animals may inhibit disease spread in both contact-based and waterborne pathogen-based diseases. The capacity of highly infected animals, both alive and dead, to release a substantial number of infective elements into the water column, making them available to suspension feeders results in such diseases being highly infective with a very small low-abundance refuge. In these systems, the body burden of pathogens and the relative importance between the release and the removal rate of pathogens in the host tissue or water column becomes paramount. Two processes are of potential consequence inhibiting epizootics. First, large water volumes above the benthic susceptible populations can function as a sink for pathogens. Second, unlike contact-based disease models in which an increase in the number of susceptible individuals in the population increases the likelihood of transmission and epizootic development, large populations of filter feeders can reduce this likelihood through the overfiltration of infective particles.",10.1002/ecs2.1286

From the clutches obtained, the basic biologic parameters were calculated and the individuals hatched under laboratory conditions counted and measured every two weeks. The clutches contained an average of 44 eggs, which took about 13.7 days to hatch at a birth rate of 41.82%. The growth pattern in the five clutches was analyzed individually, and the logistic model used was the one with the highest degree of fit to that observed growth pattern, followed by the Gompertz model, and finally the von Bertalanffy model. In addition, the models were applied to the 102 specimens analyzed together as a cohort, where the best fitting model was also proved to be the logistic growth model. A concave type III survival curve was obtained from the horizontal life table. The cohort was reduced by 48% during the first 50 days after birth.

Also, the phenotypic traits of all progeny differed amongst the culture sites, suggesting a significant environmental effect. The Zhuhai site was more suitable for oyster aquaculture than the Maowei Sea site. Thus, our results demonstrated that crossbreeding between Zhuhai and Maowei Sea stocks of Hong Kong oyster to produce superior heterosis represents a promising means to improve the fishery yield of this species in southern China.",10.1111/are.13070

Previously, we isolated the natural sperm attractant by bioassay-guided fractionation and high-performance liquid chromatography, and chemically identified it as the free-amino acid L-tryptophan (L-Trp). In the present study, levels of this ecologically meaningful compound were quantified in various abalone tissues, and in freshly spawned eggs. Tryptophan was the least abundant of 19 dissolved free amino acids (DFAAs) in ovary, testis, foot muscle, gill, stomach and hemolymph. As a proportion of the DFAA pool, however, Trp concentrations were significantly elevated in eggs (three-to seven-times higher) relative to all other sampled tissues. Natural rates of Trp release from eggs also were measured and correlated with fertility. Fertilization success peaked during an initial 30 min period (post-spawn), but decreased to nil over the next 50 min. Closely paralleling these events, Trp accumulated in seawater around freshly spawned eggs for the first 45 min (post-spawn) before decaying rapidly from solution. Older eggs stopped releasing Trp approximately when they became infertile, revealing a critical link between gamete physiology and chemical signaling. This apparent negative feedback loop did not arise from tryptophan oxidation, uptake by bacteria in seawater, or a degrading enzyme released by eggs. As a metabolic precursor critical to development of the larval nervous system, Trp could be an honest indicator of egg fitness for prospective sperm suitors. Our results suggest that endogenous signaling pathways have been co-opted for external communication between gametes, as an adaptation to increase reproductive success by promoting sperm navigation towards fertile eggs.",10.1242/jeb.027029

First, we addressed the transferability of H. discus hannai microsatellites to the three other members of Pacific abalone and five additional species (H. diversicolor aquatilis, H. midae, H. corrugata, H. fulgens, and H. rubra). Second, using the microsatellites we applied two types of individual assignment testing (the distance-based assignment and Bayesian model-based clustering) to individuals from the Pacific abalone species. A total of 24 microsatellites were subjected to PCR trials for nine Haliotis species, and the cross-species amplification performance of these markers turned out to drop precipitously even for less divergent congeners. Within the Pacific abalone species complex, four of the 24 markers were not transferable to H. gigantea, suggesting a solid genetic boundary between H. gigantea and H. discus hannai, H. discus discus, and H. madaka. Among the three latter abalones, both assignment tests achieved approximately 90% or more success rate of assignment.

The amount of suitable habitat available for the endangered white abalone (Haliotis sorenseni) was quantified to aid in obtaining an accurate estimate of the number of remaining individuals at two offshore banks and one island site off the coast of southern California. Habitat was mapped by using multibeam sonar survey techniques and categorized by using rugosity and topographic position analysis. Abalone densities were evaluated by using a remotely operated vehicle and video transect methods. The total amount of suitable habitat at these three sites was far greater than that previously estimated. Therefore, although present estimates of white abalone densities are several orders of magnitude lower than historic estimates, the total population is likely larger than previously reported because of the additional amount of habitat surveyed in this study.",

Amino acid sequence analysis showed the protein to consist of 134 amino acids and to contain three sequence repeats of; 40 amino acids which were very similar to the well-known whey acidic protein domains of other proteins. The new protein was therefore named perlwapin. In addition to the major sequence, we identified several minor variants. Atomic force microscopy was used to explore the interaction of perlwapin with calcite crystals. Monomolecular layers of calcite crystals dissolve very slowly in deionized water and recrystallize in supersaturated calcium carbonate solution. When perlwapin was dissolved in the supersaturated calcium carbonate solution, growth of the crystal was inhibited immediately. Perlwapin molecules bound tightly to distinct step edges, preventing the crystal layers from growing. Using lower concentrations of perlwapin in a saturated calcium carbonate solution, we could distinguish native, active perlwapin molecules from denaturated ones. These observations showed that perlwapin can act as a growth inhibitor for calcium carbonate crystals in saturated calcium carbonate solution. The function of perlwapin in nacre growth may be to inhibit the growth of certain crystallographic planes in the mineral phase of the polymer/mineral composite nacre.",10.1529/biophysj.106.086108

One such seafood is the Xishi abalone (Haliotis gigantea), which displays muscle color polymorphism wherein a small subset of individuals display orange coloration of muscles due to carotenoid enrichment. However, the metabolic basis for carotenoid accumulation has not been thoroughly investigated in marine mollusks. Here, GC-TOF-MS-based untargeted metabolite profiling was used to identify key pathways and metabolites involved in differential carotenoid accumulation in abalones with variable carotenoid contents. Cholesterol was the most statistically significant metabolite that differentiated abalones with orange muscles against those with common white muscles. This observation is likely due to the competitive interactions between cholesterol and carotenoids during cellular absorption. In addition, the accumulation of carotenoids was also related to fatty acid contents. Overall, this study indicates that metabolomics can reflect physiological changes in organisms and provides a useful framework for exploring the mechanisms underlying carotenoid accumulation in abalone types.",10.1038/s41598-019-51117-9

"Nguyen, TV; Alfaro, AC",Targeted metabolomics to investigate antimicrobial activity of itaconic acid in marine molluscs,2019,METABOLOMICS,15,7,,,97,"IntroductionItaconic acid (ITA) has recently been identified as an antimicrobial metabolite in mammalian immune cells. The presence of ITA was alsoreported in different tissues of marine molluscs, indicating its role as an endogenous metabolite of molluscs. In addition, the accumulation of ITA has been observed in different tissues of mussels following pathogen challenges. However, the concentration of ITA in mussel tissues and the possible role of this metabolite in the molluscan innate immune system remain unknown.ObjectivesThis study aims to quantitatively measure ITA levels in different tissues of marine mussels following an experimental challenge with Vibrio sp. DO1 isolate, and to identify the antimicrobial role of ITA in the innate immune system through the measurement of metabolic and immune alterations in tissues following the challenge.MethodsIn this study, adult Perna canaliculus mussels were experimentally challenged with a pathogenic Vibrio sp. DO1 isolate. The metabolite profiles of five different tissues, including mantle, gill, muscle, hepatopancreas and haemolymph were obtained, and levels of ITA in each tissue were characterized using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics approach. Flow cytometry was also employed to measure cell health parameters, including oxidative stress via reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, apoptosis via changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and haemocyte viability.ResultsThe ITA levels in mantle, gill, muscle and hepatopancreas tissues at 18-h post infection (hpi) with Vibrio sp. were 40.31, 41.71, 11.61 and 41.66ngmg(-1), respectively. In haemolymph, the level of ITA was significantly increased from 95.25ngml(-1) at 6 hpi to 174.36ngml(-1) at 18hpi and 572.12ngml(-1) at 60hpi. In line with the accumulation of ITA, we observed increased levels of metabolites within the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, anti-inflammatory metabolites and alterations of other metabolites associated with immune responses of the host. The flow cytometry analyses revealed increases in ROS production, apoptotic cells and decreases in cell viability.ConclusionsWe reported on the production of ITA in different tissues of P. canaliculus mussels challenged with a marine pathogen which confirmed ITA as an antimicrobial metabolite. The findings revealed insights into the biosynthesis of ITA and suggests its role in antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities in the innate immune system. This study also provided insights into the innate immune system of bivalves and highlighted the potential use of ITA as a biomarker for shellfish health assessment in aquaculture.",10.1007/s11306-019-1556-8

For red abalone (Haliotis rufescens), a large marine snail, the relationship between chemical signaling and fluid motion largely determines fertilization success. Egg-derived attractant plumes are dynamic, changing their size and shape in response to unique combinations of physical and chemical environmental features. Attractant plumes that promote sexual reproduction, however, are limited to a precise set of hydrodynamic conditions. Performance-maximizing shears are those that most closely match flows in native spawning habitats. Under conditions in which reproductive success is chronically limited by sperm availability, gametes are under selection for mechanisms that increase sperm-egg encounter. Here, chemoattraction is found to provide a cheap evolutionary alternative for enhancing egg target size without enlarging cytoplasmic and/or cell volume. Because egg signaling and sperm response may be tuned to meet specific fluid-dynamic constraints, shear could act as a critical selective pressure that drives gamete evolution and determines fitness.",10.1073/pnas.1018666108

Prior work has shown that settlement in two shoreline echinoids (a sea urchin and a sand dollar) is unexpectedly sensitive to an environmental feature (intense fluid turbulence) that can be considered as a signal to larvae of their arrival in the neighbourhood of the hydrodynamically energetic habitats in which these taxa live as adults. Here, we used a comparative approach to explore the evolution of turbulence responsiveness in late-stage echinoid larvae. We examined three pairs of closely related sea urchins that differ in the energetic exposure of their adult habitats and found that larval responsiveness to turbulence was more pronounced in urchins that settle in more hydrodynamically exposed locations.

The present study revealed that isolates from the giant abalone and Yesso scallops were phenotypically different, with slower growth in modified eugon broth and a lack of prolyl aminopeptidase and phenylalanine aminopeptidase in Yesso scallop isolates. Additionally, we found that 3 of 8 housekeeping genes were different between them. Based on these phenotypic and genetic differences, we propose that F. halioticida isolated from Yesso scallops in Japan be designated as the 'J-scallop type' to distinguish it from strains from abalone ('abalone type'). Whole-genome sequencing analysis of a strain belonging to the J-scallop type showed that the overall similarity between the J-scallop and abalone type strains was estimated to be 99.84 %. In accordance with a lack of prolyl aminopeptidase activity, in general, all of the J-scallop type strains examined have a 1 bp deletion in the responsible gene encoding prolyl aminopeptidase.

The historical, cultural and ecological value of molluscs makes them a highly sought-after delicacy in many regions of the world. Specifically, the aquaculture of abalone and that of limpets are two key industries with striking similarities and importance within the context of food production and food security. In this review, the current knowledge of these two commercially important seafood species is explored for a comprehensive understanding of its aquaculture status. The various culture methods and systems, animal nutrition and necessary improvements are discussed for abalone and limpets, respectively. For abalone, the knowledge base is extensive and some reviews have been written to compile essential information regarding different aspects of this healthy industry. For limpets, there is a small collection of aquaculture literature, and this is, to the authors' knowledge, the first comprehensive review of the research. Our goal was to reveal, within the area of aquaculture research, the current status of both abalone and limpet industries while exposing their respective knowledge gaps for appropriate development of new technologies. With a firm understanding of these molluscs, the production of abalone and limpet will be sustainable for the long term.",10.1111/raq.12190

Samples were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and hybridized at 40 A degrees C for 3 h using a TAMRA (5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine)-labeled probe (Rpt probe). Strain Ab1 could be clearly discriminated from other control bacteria (Enterococcus, Lactobacillus). Fluorescence signals of Rpt-positive bacteria were easily distinguished from any detectable background noise. Rpt-positive bacteria were detected in both probiotic-supplemented and control abalone; nevertheless, the number of Rpt-positive bacteria in probiotic-supplemented abalone was two orders of magnitude higher than in controls. Furthermore, the mean number of Rpt-positive bacteria (probiotic-supplemented abalone) in the gut-attached section was also two orders of magnitude higher than in the free-living section. Rpt-positive micro-colonies (MCs) were observed by thin-section FISH analysis only in probiotic-supplemented abalone, and these MCs were observed in contact with intestinal epithelial cells. These results indicate that the probiotic Pediococcus sp. strain Ab1 can colonize or adhere to the abalone digestive tract in numbers sufficient for therapeutic effects. The data obtained using our FISH method provide clear and direct evidence of the formation of probiotic colonies in the gut of supplemented abalone.",10.1007/s12562-016-0981-0

Three dietary treatments were used, and consisted of 100% of the flagellate Isochrysis sp. clone T-ISO (treatment I), 70% T-ISO + 30% kelp meal (IK), and 70% T-ISO + 30% cod liver oil (IO). Ingestion rates (IR) were also assessed during the first month of the experiment in clams from treatment I. The IR exhibited by adult P. globosa remained relatively constant during the evaluation period (0.027-0.035% BW d(-1)). In contrast, significant time-and diet-dependent effects were observed in the live weight of conditioned organisms, those from treatment I showing the maximum values (1369 to 1533 g) after 7 weeks, followed by IO and IK. Lowest BWC (39.0 to 42.1%) coincided with the timing of maximum live weight and female gonad weight. Female and male gonad weights increased 2-fold and 1.4-fold respectively within the first month. Gonads from the IK treatment tended to be lighter than those from diets I or IO. Significant time, diet, and time x diet effects were observed on the flesh weight of the organisms, with higher values on the 8th week for organisms from treatment I. Neither CI nor GI was significantly affected by the test factors. Viable oocytes were detected only after 6 weeks of conditioning. Overall, the ration demanded by adults of P. globosa is relatively low, and adults can be successfully matured in the laboratory within a period of 6 to 8 weeks with Isochrysis sp. clone T-ISO as the sole diet, and an effective accumulated temperature of ca. 230 degree-days.

The biomineralization process takes place in the extrapallial space, between inner shell and outer mantle epithelium, and is believed to be under the control of calcium-binding proteins and hormonal factors such as calcitonin-related molecules (CGRP-like peptides). Epithelial cells from the mantle are responsible from the secretion of matrix molecules whereas hemocytes are involved in ion transportation during shell formation and regeneration. To understand the biochemical and cellular events implied in the biomineralization process, we developed primary cell cultures from the nacreous gastropod Haliotis tuberculata. Mantle cells as well as hemocyte cell cultures were successfully maintained in vitro and evaluated for their viability and proliferation using semiautomated assays. The effect of calcitonin-related molecules (h-CGRP) on cellular activity and proliferation was evaluated in those primary cell Cultures. The results indicate that human-CGRP modulates the activity of both mantle cells and hemocytes and increases carbonic anhydrase activity in vitro. These results are consistent with those obtained in vitro, supporting the hypothesis that CGRP-like molecules control the activity of target cells involved in the biomineralization process.",10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[887:CRTAOM]2.0.CO;2

These include compliance enforcement, the management and conservation of marine organisms, and commercial quality control. Abalone poaching worldwide and illegal trade in abalone products have increased mainly because of the attractive prices obtained and caused a sharp decline in stocks. Alleged poachers have been acquitted because of lack of evidence to correctly identify species. Therefore, a robust method is required that would identify tissue of abalone origin to species level. The aim of this study was to develop immunologic techniques, using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, to identify 10 different abalone species and subspecies from South Africa, the United States, Australia, and Japan. The combination of 3 developed monoclonal antibodies to South African abalone (Haliotis midae) enabled differentiation between most of the 10 species including the subspecies H. diversicolor supertexta and H. diversicolor diversicolor.

The Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) Larvae were kept under a 12/12 h light/dark photoperiod (DD) in order to determine the effects of ALAN on embryonic development. To simulate the street lighting conditions at night, the artificial light was switched on from 18:00 until midnight (AD) or until 06:00 the next day (ND). Moreover, Groups AD and ND had a considerably greater hatching success rate and metamorphosis rate than Group DD (P < 0.05), whereas Group DD had a significantly longer hatching period and course to complete the metamorphosis of the larvae (P < 0.05). Transcriptomic analyses showed that members of Groups AD and DD had considerably higher expression levels of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, spliceosome function, and the mRNA surveillance pathway. Prostaglandin B2, L-pal-mitoylcarnitine, stearic acid, palmitic acid, leukotriene C4, and arachidonic acid were screened by non-targeted metabolomics as differential metabolic markers that played a vital role in the response of larvae to different ALAN conditions. Multi-omics correlation analysis suggested that five pathways related to fatty acid synthesis, catabolism, and metabolism, such as biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid metabolism, were enriched in each comparison. Further quantitative analysis showed that compared to Group DD, 33 out of 50 fatty acids were upregulated in Group AD, and the levels of almost all fatty acids were increased in Group ND, which in turn suggested that fatty acids played a vital role in the physiological response of larvae to illumination changes. The findings of this work were significant for the unbiased and full-scale assessment of the ecological effects of ALAN, as well as the structural stability of the marine benthic community.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111472
"Gorfine, HK",Post-harvest weight loss has important implications for abalone quota management,2001,JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH,20,2,795,802,,"Regulations forming part of the abalone quota management system in Victoria, Australia require that abalone processors notify fisheries authorities of quantities of abalone consigned from commercial divers within 25 h of landing. The regulations also require that the abalone are to be landed whole in the shell, and transported and stored in sealed bins until confirmation of official notification. Although the bins cannot be opened before notification, the 25-h limit for notification provides a window of opportunity to make potential gains through weight loss in those abalone destined for canning. This arises because notified weights, rather than weights estimated upon landing, are used to decrement the quota allocations of individual divers, I investigated the potential for post-harvest weight loss by subjecting abalone to three experimental treatments selected to simulate a range of possible transport and regimes. My results demonstrate that substantial weight loss can occur in whole abalone during both ambient and refrigerated storage. Loss of weight in abalone during storage results from the release of water and body fluid associated with physiological responses to hypoxic stress caused by exposure to air. In Victoria, about 60% of the landed catch is used to produce canned product. Because of the observed weight losses during storage, divers supplying abalone for canning have to harvest more abalone to achieve their quotas than those supplying abalone for live export. Losses in weight of 10-20% observed during this study equate to a harvest of 6-12% (350,000-700,000 abalone) more than the total allowable catches. Harvesting these additional quantities of abalone may exceed desired fishing mortalities for long-term population sustainability. If beach weights were deducted from quotas, then this problem could be resolved.",

An oral challenge test with the crude royal jelly beverage was not performed, but a similar test with a beverage including honey caused no symptoms. A positive response to the beverage of crude royal jelly was not observed in normal volunteers. A positive diagnosis of anaphylaxis due to royal jelly was made based on the positive prick test, systemic clinical symptoms and the negative prick tests in healthy volunteers. Moreover, the patient had no symptoms when taking lemon and orange, which were present as essences in the crude royal jelly beverage, and also had no response to honey after anaphylaxis. Increased consumption of royal jelly in health food supplements may increase the incidence of royal jelly-related allergic reactions.

Trophic level correlates with production volume (tons/yr) and with unit value (US$/ton) in aquaculture but not in capture fisheries (FAO's fisheries data). Apparently, sustainability and economics in aquaculture both depend on ecological efficiency, i.e., the use of resources and the production of waste. Species feeding low in the food chain use efficiently the natural resources. Each level up the food chain inflates costs related to the use of resources, the production of waste and the maintenance of water quality. This effect has further repercussions on the economics of aquaculture: (1) cost influences profit and unit price, and (2) price influences demand and market share. The overall ecological efficiency, sustainability and economics of culturing carnivorous fish are improved by growing them in an ecological balance with species from low trophic levels in integrated multi-trophic aquaculture.",10.1080/13657305.2012.649046

Here, we compare the energetics of early development of a tropical ophiuroid, Ophiocoma alexandri, and a temperate to tropical echinoid, Arbacia punctulata, two species with similarly sized eggs. Measurements of respiration and constituent analyses were performed on eggs and unfed larvae of both species. Members of both species showed an increase in oxygen consumption during morphogenesis followed by a lower, static rate once morphogenesis was complete (3 d for O. alexandri and 1.3 d for A. punctulata). Compared to the echinoid larvae, the ophiuroid larvae developed more slowly and had peak respiration rates that were 3.1x lower. Eggs of O. alexandri contained significantly more protein and significantly less triacylglycerol than eggs of A. punctulata. Energy utilization, as calculated via respiration measurements, closely matched decreases in energy content from the eggs to larvae as measured with biochemical constituent assays. Larvae of A. punctulata used 1.4x more energy to reach the pluteus stage than larvae of O. alexandri, and used 4x more energy during the first 9 d of larval life. These data suggest that echinoid larvae require more energy to develop to the feeding stage than ophiuroid larvae, and likewise have higher requirements for maintenance metabolism. Ophiuroid larvae may be more tolerant of low food levels due to their very low metabolic rates, but this advantage may be offset by their slower rate of development.",10.1111/j.1744-7410.2012.00277.x

The aetiology of these outbreaks remained unknown until the bacterium Francisella halioticida was detected in some mussel mortality cases. This retrospective study was conducted to assess the association between F. halioticida and these mussel mortalities. Mussel batches (n = 45) from the Atlantic coast and English Channel were selected from archived individual samples (n = 863) collected either during or outside of mortality events between 2014 and 2017. All mussels were analysed by real-time PCR assays targeting F. halioticida; in addition, 185 were analysed using histological analysis and 178 by 16S rRNA metabarcoding.

It has 930-bp full length with a 717-bp open reading frame (01117), encoding 239 amino acids. The AbTNF-alpha amino acid sequence shows the characteristic TNF family signature, N-terminal transmembrane domain consisting of a hydrophobic amino acid cluster and cell attachment sequence at (155)RGD(157). Phylogenic analysis results showed that AbTNF-alpha is more related to the invertebrate Ciona savignyi TNF superfamily ligand member (CsTL). Quantitative real-time PCR expression results showed that AbTNF-alpha was constitutively expressed in both immune and non-immune tissues in a tissue specific manner. The highest constitutive expression was in the gill tissue with a 1.5-fold compared to hemocytes expression. The AbTNF-alpha mRNA expression in gill tissue was monitored in vivo stimulated by a mixture of pathogenic bacteria (Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahemolyticus, and Lysteria monocytogenes), viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

Previously, atomic force microscopy demonstrated that abalone nacre proteins bind to growing step edges and to specific crystallographic faces of calcite, suggesting that inhibition of calcite growth may be one of the molecular processes required for growth of the less thermodynamically stable aragonite phase. Previous experiments were done with protein mixtures. To elucidate the role of single proteins, we have characterized two proteins isolated from the aragonitic component of nacre of the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens. These proteins, purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, are designated AP7 and AP24 (aragonitic protein of molecular weight 7 kDa and 24 kDa, respectively). Degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to N-terminal and internal peptide sequences were used to amplify cDNA clones by a polymerase chain reaction from a mantle cDNA library; the deduced primary amino acid sequences are presented. Preliminary crystal growth experiments demonstrate that protein fractions enriched in AP7 and AP24 produced CaCO3 crystals with morphology distinct from crystals grown in the presence of the total mixture of soluble aragonite-specific proteins. Peptides corresponding to the first 30 residues of the N-terminal sequences of both AP7 and AP24 were generated. The synthetic peptides frustrate the progression of step edges of a growing calcite surface, indicating that sequence features within the N-termini of AP7 and AP24 include domains that interact with CaCO3. CD analyses demonstrate that the N-terminal peptide sequences do not possess significant percentages of alpha-helix or beta-strand secondary structure in solution. Instead, in both the presence and absence of Ca(II), the peptides retain unfolded conformations that may facilitate protein-mineral interaction. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/bip.10536
"Troynikov, VS; Gorfine, HK",Alternative approach for establishing legal minimum lengths for abalone based on stochastic growth models for length increment data,1998,JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH,17,3,827,831,,"Stochastic parametrization of length-increment data was used to estimate the distribution of maximum length of abalone populations. The distribution of maximum length provides important information for establishing a legal minimum length (LML). Legal minimum length is commonly used to optimize yield and/or reproductive potential in abalone populations. Although choice of LML is generally based on deterministic estimates of average values of growth parameters, there is strong evidence in abalone growth data that distributions of maximum length in abalone populations have large variances and proportions of abalone that cannot attain the LML. However; deterministic estimates give no indication of the proportion of individuals that may or may not attain a specific LML. Consequently, deterministic estimates of growth can be misleading and may result in setting inappropriate LMLs. Length-increment data from tagged individuals in three H. rubra populations in Victoria, Australia were analyzed using new stochastic versions of the Gompertz model reparameterized for tagging data. Outputs from the stochastic Gompertz model for tagging data include distributions of I, that show the proportion of abalone in each studied population that were unlikely to attain the LML and enter the stock. It is presently unknown whether this lever of protection will ensure long-term sustainability. The proportion conserved may also be viewed as lost yield to the fishery. If the proportion of abalone required to provide sufficient egg production for sustaining a particular population is known, then the stochastic Gompertz model for tagging data provides additional information to select an appropriate LML that balances reproductive output against yield to the fishery.",

Consumers selected only a few emoji per stimulus when using CATA (check-all-that-apply) questions, and layout of the CATA question had only a small impact on responses. A comparison of CATA questions with forced yes/no questions and RATA (rate-all-that-apply) questions revealed an increase in frequency of emoji use for yes/no questions, but not a corresponding improvement in sample discrimination. For the stimuli in this research, which elicited similar emotional associations, RATA was probably the best methodological choice, with 8.5 emoji being used per stimulus, on average, and increased sample discrimination relative to CATA (12% vs. 6-8%). The research provided additional support for the potential of emoji surveys as a method for measurement of emotional associations to foods and beverages and began contributing to development of guidelines for implementation.",10.1016/j.foodres.2017.04.028

It is an economically crucial species; however, its population has been declining due to overfishing and overexploitation. Hence, we developed a novel polyculture and water-flow method for mass production of this species. Furthermore, the findings from this work also uncover the potentiality of L. canarium in integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) and its implication for aquaculture and resource restoration. Laevistrombus canarium, also known as dog conch, is a marine gastropod mollusk widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific region. It is an economically crucial species; however, its population has been declining due to overfishing and overexploitation. In this study, the suitable salinity for juvenile L. canarium was between 20 and 35 parts per thousand. Diatoms and biological detritus by using flow-water from the fish pool were the most favorable diets for newly metamorphosed and 10 mm juveniles. In the polyculture experiment, L. canarium was cultured with whiteleg shrimp, tilapia, small abalone, purple sea urchin, and collector urchin. Better growth was found in all co-culture groups except with whiteleg shrimp. We also found that the polyculture system with or without substrates significantly affected the growth of juveniles. Additionally, we observed that water temperature was the most crucial factor for growth and survival; a water temperature of less than 10 degrees C might cause the death of L. canarium. We have proposed a novel polyculture and water-flow method for mass production of L. canarium and evaluated the feasibility and benefits of polyculture with other species. The findings from this work reveal the potentiality of L. canarium in integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) and its implication for aquaculture and resource restoration.",10.3390/biology10080812

In addition, mass strandings leave beached individuals exposed to air. The effects of exposure to air on undersized J. lalandii (carapace lengths 60-74 mm) were analysed for a range of exposure periods (0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 300 min) that realistically spanned conditions experienced during fishing operations or following mass strandings. Four approaches were used to assess the effects: (1) changes in the speed and nature of escape responses; (2) frequencies of capture by a predator; (3) changes in haemolymph chemistry; (4) growth rates. The time-to-first-response of lobsters after being returned to water was correlated with duration of exposure to air, ranging from 0.2 s by unexposed (control) lobsters to 13 min by individuals exposed for 300 min. The number of tail flips, the distance swum after release and the efficacy of escape from an octopus also decreased significantly as exposure to air increased. A progressive decrease of haemolymph pH from 7.5 in control lobsters to 6.89 in those exposed for 300 min indicated increasing metabolic acidosis. Haemolymph L-lactate concentration increased linearly with emersion time from 1.07 mu mol/ml in controls to 18.5 mu mol/ml in lobsters exposed for 300 min, reflecting at least a partial switch to anaerobic metabolism. Overall, these physiological effects diminished the lobsters' response time and ability to escape, leaving them vulnerable to predation. No effects of exposure to air on subsequent growth rate were detected. Due to the severity of the effects of prolonged air-exposure, existing contingency plans to rescue lobsters after mass strandings will be futile unless they can be returned to the sea rapidly.

Recently, prominent blooms of Cochlodinium have occurred in central and southern California (20042008), and Cochlodinium cells are now routinely observed in microscopical analysis of algal assemblages from Californian coastal waters. The first documented economic loss due to a Cochlodinium bloom in California occurred in Monterey Bay and resulted in the mortality of commercially farmed abalone. Increasing occurrences of Cochlodinium blooms, the fact that these cells preserve poorly using standard techniques, and the difficulty of identifying preserved specimens using morphological criteria make Cochlodinium species prime candidates for the development of a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) approach. The 18S rDNA gene sequenced from Cochlodinium cells obtained from California coastal waters, as well as GenBank sequences of Cochlodinium, were used to design and test a Molecular Beacon (R) approach. The qPCR method developed in this study is species specific, sensitive for the detection of C. fulvescens that has given rise to the recent blooms in the eastern Pacific Ocean, and spans a dynamic abundance range of seven orders of magnitude. Initial application of the method to archived field samples collected during blooms in Monterey Bay revealed no statistically significant correlations between gene copy number and environmental parameters.

We cloned and analyzed the expression pattern and genomic structure of the MnSOD gene of pearl oyster Pinctada fucata, hereafter designated as PoMnSOD. The full-length PoMnSOD cDNA was 1080 bp in length and consisted of a 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of 222 bp, a 3'-UTR of 318 bp with a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) at 15 nucleotides upstream of the poly (A) tail, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 540 bp encoding a polypeptide of 180 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 20.4 kDa and a predicted pI of 6.72. Sequence analysis showed that PoMnSOD contained MnSOD family signatures F(44)NGGGHLNH(52), I(97)QGSGWGWLA(106) and D(138)VWEHAYY(145), four conserved residues for manganese metal binding (H-4, H-52, D-138 and H-142), and two potential N-glycosylation sites (N-33 and N-51). Homology analysis revealed that PoMnSOD shared 47.6-55.9% identity and 57.4-65.6% similarity to the other known PoMnSOD amino acid sequences. PoMnSOD genomic DNA was 5040 bp in length and contained three exons and two introns, which was a tripartite organization and coincided with the consensus GT-AG splicing rule. PoMnSOD promoter contained the various transcription factors associated with the immune modulation and stress responses. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that PoMnSOD was constitutively expressed in all detected tissues, and PoMnSOD mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated in intestine, mantle, gills, digestive gland and haemocytes after Vibrio alginolyticus injection. These results suggested that PoMoSOD was an acute-response protein involved in the innate immune responses of pearl oyster, and provided general information about the mechanisms of innate immune defense against bacterial infection in pearl oyster.

This study estimates the biomass of E. maxima available for harvesting, investigates the effects of harvesting on the recovery of kelp and on the benthic understorey biota, and tests an alternative method of harvesting kelp by cutting off only fronds rather than whole plants. Estimates from diver sampling between May 1992 and November 1994 and infra-red maps indicate an E. maxima biomass at Danger Point of 22 973 tons fresh mass in 336 ha of kelp beds, insufficient to sustain projected abalone feed requirements in the area if harvesting is done in the traditional manner of cutting the stipes. However, sufficient frond material may be harvested sustainably if only fronds are cut, at distances 20-30 cm from the bases of fronds. Cutting at 10 cm from the base significantly reduced regrowth rates, and there was little regrowth after cutting at 2 cm. Yield per unit effort was higher for a four-month interval between harvesting them for one-, two- and three-month intervals. Two years after harvesting whole plants (in two 100 x 20 in lanes), biomass and density of kelp had recovered (similar in control and harvested lanes), and there were no detectable differences in the understorey communities, as measured by detrended correspondence analysis. Although harvesting of whole kelp has a minimal effect on the understorey biota and kelp itself recovers within two years, selective cutting of fronds allows plants to remains alive and produce a higher yield. This method is likely to minimize damage to the kelp bed system.",10.2989/025776102784528501

Using white abalone Haliotis sorenseni, a critically marine broadcast spawner with spatially patchy remnant populations in southern California (USA), as an example, we developed an individual-based model that describes density-, temperature-, and habitat-dependent biological processes. Using the model, we evaluated hypothetical stocking strategies including spatial distribution and size of stocked abalone and initial density of resident abalone. Our results show that stocking strategies for the modeled white abalone populations benefited most when stocking locations had resident abalone and when stocked abalone were large in size. We also examined the potential influence of the spatial structure of the habitat (i. e. percentage of suitable habitat and spatial distribution of habitat cells), ocean warming, and poaching on restoration outcomes. We found that the percentage of suitable habitat greatly affected population dynamics, with more suitable habitat resulting in a slower decline in population growth and recruitment, as well as a higher and more stable proportion of intermediate-sized abalone. The spatial distribution (random or clustered) of habitat cells and of stocked abalone had less of an impact on model outcomes. Elevated temperature and poaching both had strong negative impacts on abalone population growth in the model. Given the spatial structure of the habitat and population, ocean warming and poaching are considered critical factors in the development of restoration strategies for endangered broadcast spawners.",10.3354/esr00804

While marine reserves are commonly used to mitigate risks to marine populations, the duration, size, location and larval connectivity needed for a reserve to help conserve genetic resources is still poorly understood. Here, we examine the effects of fishing, reserves, and restocking on the genetic diversity of 10 populations from central Baja California, Mexico, and Southern California, USA. We demonstrate that each population shows characteristic genetic signatures according to recent management decisions. We found high allelic diversity, particularly rare alleles, a larger effective population size and a lack of a recent genetic bottleneck in pink abalones within a small (0.8 km(2)), recently established (5 years) reserve in Baja California, compared to other fished sites after a climatic bottleneck. Higher diversity may result from the presence of older animals in the reserve. Due to its location, the reserve may also act as an important hub connecting distant populations via larval dispersal. In contrast, a population from California showed genetic isolation, loss of allelic diversity and high relatedness, consistent with the collapse of fisheries in the 1990s and their lack of recovery thereafter. In addition, a fished area in Baja California with a history of restocking for over a decade showed an increase in frequency of related individuals and high genetic differentiation from nearby sites that were consistent with the production of larvae from a few adults in the laboratory. A network of strategically placed small marine reserves that considers ocean circulation patterns could help to maintain genetic diversity and connectivity of exploited populations.

Based on viral genome sequence information, a virus-specific real-time TaqMan assay was developed for detection and identification of the abalone herpes-like virus (AbHV). The assay was shown to be specific as it did not detect other viruses from either the Herpesvirales or the Iridovirales orders which have genome sequence similarities.

"Mayfield, S",Enhancing fishery assessments for an Australian abalone fishery using commercial weight-grade data,2010,FISHERIES RESEARCH,105,1,28,37,,"Effective management of commercial fisheries is dependent on the reliability of fishery assessments that, in turn, are determined by the quantity and quality of the available data. Data on the length-structure of the catch provide important information on exploited stocks, but representative sub-sampling is difficult to achieve, especially where numerous licence holders fish over large areas. This study evaluates the potential for routinely collected, commercial, weight-grade data to overcome this challenge and enhance assessment of the Western Zone blacklip (Haliotis rubra) and greenlip (Haliotis laevigata) abalone fisheries in South Australia. Current weight-grade data for blacklip abalone are inaccurate. However, the accuracy, rigour and consistency of the data for greenlip abalone confirm they are sufficiently reliable for aiding fishery assessments on this species. The greenlip abalone data were highly representative of the catch and the fishery and have been obtained in a consistent manner for >20 years. Changes in the composition of the grades in the catch provide a meaningful measure of change in the harvested stock. Similarly, measures of mean weight and number harvested, derived from the weight-grade data, are valuable as additional indices of stock status. These attributes substantially enhance the credibility of these data for use in assessing changes in stock status through time, and suggest these data should be used to supplement current assessments of this species. The value of the weight-grade data would increase substantially if the resolution was improved by using automated weighing and grading systems. The analysis of weight-grade data, routinely collected from numerous fisheries, is likely to benefit their assessment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.fishres.2010.02.007

Mainland and island locations were genetically differentiated based on allele frequency differences and the presence of private alleles in some island populations. Although microgeographic genetic structure among sites on SN was weak and not statistically significant, heterozygosity varied among sites, with diversity decreasing from west to east. In addition, investigation among cohorts showed that adults were genetically differentiated among island locations, whereas no differences among juveniles were detected.

Therefore, in this study, we investigated anti-adipogenic effects of alpha AL14 on preadipocyte, 3T3-L1. Obesity is an imbalance in metabolism caused by excessive energy intake or reduced energy consumption, and fat accumulates in the body, which causes chronic disease such as high pressure, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Inhibition of adipogenesis has been focused on as a strategy for treating metabolic disease including diabetes and obesity. In order to confirm the effect on adipocyte differentiation, alpha AL14 was treated while inducing differentiation from preadipocytes into mature adipocytes. We observed that alpha AL14 potently and dose-dependently suppressed accumulation of lipid droplets during mature adipocyte differentiation. alpha AL14 also down-regulated the expression of key adipogenic regulator such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1). In addition, alpha AL14 diminished the insulin-stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling and its downstream factors that promote adipogenesis by inducing the expression of PPAR gamma, such as mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3 beta) and forkhead box (Fox) transcription factors, which may reduce glucose uptake in response to insulin and lipid accumulation. These results indicated that alpha AL14 suppresses adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation depending on multiple mechanisms.

The present study therefore measured the effect of age on various reproductive parameters of T. heterouncinata from cultured abalone Haliotis midae. Age did not have a significant effect on body size, fecundity or rate at which eggs were laid. However, age had an affect on the proportion of the population that was brooding offspring, because a significantly lower percentage of the youngest age-group was brooding eggs or young, in comparison with the older groups. T heterouncinata are long-lived, surviving for over four years on abalone farms and can therefore spread their reproductive effort over an extended period, instead of restricting it to a limited period during its early life.

An intensive, biofiltered recirculating integrated system producing fish and seaweed on a semi-commercial scale was evaluated with respect to production and to nutrient and heat budgets. The system consisted of abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) and sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) tanks, an intensive fishpond (Sparus aurata), and a three-stage Ulva lactuca biofilter, which cleaned and recirculated 50% of the effluent back to the fishpond. To preserve water heat, the shellfish and fishpond units were both covered with greenhouses; the biofilter unit was covered with a greenhouse only during winter. Seaweed yield was variable and averaged 94 and 117 g m(-2) day(-1) (fresh weight) in periods with and without greenhouse cover, respectively. Protein content of U. lactuca averaged above 34% of dry weight. The biofiltration of only 50% of the water through the seaweed biofilter reduced the export of dissolved nutrients to the environment by nearly 30%. Peak ammonia excretion by the moming-fed fish coincided with maximum seaweed light-dependent ammonia uptake and concentrations of ammonia in the fishpond remained within nontoxic limits. Also, daytime photosynthesis of U. lactuca (uptake of CO2) met fish respiration (production of CO2), thus balancing fishpond pH levels within safe limits regarding ammonia toxicity. Daytime oxygen demand by the fish was partially met by the photosynthetically generated oxygen. Before covering the biofilter with a greenhouse, it lost much heat, reducing the temperature in the fishpond. Following the greenhouse covering of the biofilter, heat loss ceased and consequently the fishpond temperature was raised. Recirculation through the biofilter improved system sustainability; it reduced water use, lowered negative environmental impact, and maintained stable and safe water quality conditions in the fishpond.

In the mixed culture treatments, C. closterium dominated during the first nine days of the culture with a cell density of 5.21x10(3) cells cm(-2) and growth rate of 0.50 +/- 0.20 mu day(-1). However, from the 12th day onwards, the cell density of N. transitans var. derasa was significantly higher (4.8x10(3) cells cm(-2)) compared to that of C. closterium. Latter appeared to be the first colonizer in the culture, whereas the former took more time to establish itself, but finally out-compete the latter.",

Molluscs reflect the degree of environmental contamination and are the most useful bioindicator tools. The study of modulation of immune system or immunomodulation in marine molluscs has become one of the privileged ways for evaluating the physiological effects of environmental factors. Physiological responses of molluscs to environmental stresses could be mediated by haemocytes. These cells are continually exposed to the external environment due to the open circulatory system of molluscs and are affected by pollutants. In fact, several studies showed the effects of different environmental contaminants on haemocyte functions (viability, phagocytosis, ROS production) as well as on proteins involved in cytoskeletal structure maintenance using the in vitro approaches. In ecotoxicology, in vitro approach is an alternative to animal testing due to the reduced use of experimental animals, low cost and rapid performance. Although several studies showed the importance of using in vitro cell models to determine the effects of different environmental contaminants on haemocyte parameters in marine molluscs, a few reviews highlight these effects. The main purpose of this paper is to summarize the recent data on the effect of some xenobiotics on haemocyte parameters in some mollusc species and then suggest future research prospects.",10.1007/s10616-015-9932-3

The tissues are employed for different tasks by the animals. The foot is mainly responsible for slow gliding movements. The shell adductor muscle pulls down the shell for protection and in righting an animal which has been dislodged from the rocks. Tissue-specific differences in anaerobic energy metabolism occur. During 6 h of experimental anoxia, energy for both muscles was provided by arginine phosphate and co-fermentation of glycogen and aspartate. Glycolysis in the shell adductor muscle led mainly to the formation of the novel end product tauropine; D-lactate production predominated in the foot. This pattern is consistent with observed enzymatic profiles in the two muscles and with the equilibrium constants of the respective enzymes, tauropine and D-lactate dehydrogenase. Recovery from anaerobiosis was characterized by a rapid return of the phosphagen pool and the energy charge to the aerobic state. A protracted time-course was observed for the clearance of glycolytic end products. Exercise, primarily powdered by the shell adductor muscle, was mainly fueled by glycolysis resulting mostly in the accumulation of tauropine.",10.2307/1541899
"Lebata-Ramos, MJHL",Molluscan aquaculture in the Philippines: a review,2023,AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL,31,5,2977,3001,,"Molluscs are among the most valuable resources of the Philippines, an archipelagic country of 7,107 islands bounded by 36,000 km of coastline and 26.6 million ha of coastal waters. In 2020, production from mussels and oysters alone valued at PhP1.552 billion. As primary sources of food and livelihood for marginalized fisherfolk, they are considered important in food security, nutrition, and poverty alleviation. Nevertheless, for almost a century, mollusc culture remained small-scale, with most fish farmers investing in non-fed species, like mussels and oysters. Moreover, mollusc culture in the country is still dependent on wild sources of seed stocks, making production unsustainable and unreliable. This dependence on the wild seed stocks will continue until the issue of the lack of commercial-scale hatcheries or the limited capacity of existing hatcheries to produce seeds, both for top and emerging mollusc aquaculture species, is resolved. Although technologies from broodstock management to post-harvest are available in some species, the lack of capital and the limited government support limit these artisanal fishers from doing large commercial-scale culture. This paper summarizes what has been done and published on the leading mollusc species cultured in the Philippines. Future research activities may be designed based on the research gaps to refine available technologies and develop new ones to improve culture production. The lack of or limited relevant information on the viable economics of the different culture techniques at different culture phases, the limited availability of post-harvest technologies, and the sparse or lack of genetic information for these leading mollusc species are among the gaps that need to be addressed.",10.1007/s10499-023-01120-9

The production of annual farmed small abalone in Taiwan, once the highest in the world, has dramatically decreased in the past 15 years, and currently, the industry is close to collapse. Understanding the genetic diversity of small abalone and developing stock identification methods will be useful for genetic breeding, restoring collapsed stocks, managing stocks, and preventing illegal trade. We investigated 307 cultured and wild individuals from Taiwan, Japan, and Bali Island (Indonesia) by using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. Network analysis of mtDNA COI gene sequences revealed that the individuals collected from Taiwan, Japan, and Indonesia could be identified, and showed significant genetic divergence. In addition, the Indonesian population (Haliotis diversicolor squamata) was significantly different from the other populations and might need to be considered a separate species. We discovered a single nucleotide polymorphism marker in the mtDNA COI gene that can be used to distinguish the Taiwan population from the Japan population. We also developed a polymerase chain reactionrestriction fragment length polymorphism method for rapid detection. Furthermore, we could identify the cultured stocks, wild population, and hybrid stocks by using 6 microsatellites and amplified fragment length polymorphism. This study contributes useful tools for stock identification and the production of high-disease resistant small abalone strains (Japan x Taiwan or Taiwan x Japan). Efforts should be made to avoid unintentional random genetic mixing of the Taiwan population with the Japan population and subsequent breakdown of population differentiation, which impair local adaptation of the Taiwan wild population. Molecular markers revealed a split between the Taiwan and Japan populations, and the existence of a possible barrier to the free dispersal of small abalone is discussed.",10.1371/journal.pone.0179818

Among exceptions, abalone possesses considerable LC-PUFA conversion ability from C18 precursors. However, its characterization and relevant enzyme are not well characterized. Here we successfully cloned and characterized two Delta(5) Fads in abalone (Haliotis discus hannai Ino). Two Delta(5) Fad mRNA transcripts, Hdhfad1 (GQ 470626) and Hdhfad2 (GQ 466197), were found in abalone sharing 96.82% similarity for cDNA sequence and 96.58% similarity for their deduced amino acid sequences. Hdhfad1 cDNA is 1530 bp in length with an opening reading frame (ORF) coding for 438 amino acids. Hdhfad2 cDNA is 1525 bp in length with an ORF encoding for 439 amino acids. Both have characteristic features of front-end desaturase, including three histidine boxes, an N-terminal cytochrome b5 domain with heme-binding motif and transmembrane regions. Both Hdhfad1 and Hdhfad2 were expressed in tissues of abalone, especially in hepatopancreas and intestine. HdhFad1 possessed higher Delta(5) desaturase activity but expressed at a lower level than HdhFad2. Both isoforms preferred 20:4n-3 than 20:3n-6 as substrate. These results should provide valuable information on the molecular evolution of Fads and better understanding of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in abalone. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

This so called calcifying matrix is a complex mixture of proteins and glycoproteins that is assembled and occluded within the mineral phase during the calcification process. While the importance of the calcifying matrix to shell formation has long been appreciated, most of its protein components remain uncharacterised. Results: Recent expressed sequence tag (EST) investigations of the mantle tissue from the tropical abalone (Haliotis asinina) provide an opportunity to further characterise the proteins in the shell by a proteomic approach. In this study, we have identified a total of 14 proteins from distinct calcified layers of the shell. Only two of these proteins have been previously characterised from abalone shells. Among the novel proteins are several glutamine-and methionine-rich motifs and hydrophobic glycine-, alanine-and acidic aspartate-rich domains. In addition, two of the new proteins contained Kunitz-like and WAP (whey acidic protein) protease inhibitor domains.

The starfish outbreak in coastal areas will lead to severe economic losses in aquaculture and damage the ecological environment. However, the current monitoring methods are still artificial, time-consuming, and laborious. This study used an underwater observation platform with multiple sensors to observe the starfish outbreak in Weihai, Shandong Province. The platform could collect the temperature, salinity, depth, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, other water quality data, and underwater video data. Based on these data, the paper proposed an early warning model for starfish prevalence (EWSP) based on multi-sensor fusion. A deep learning-based object detection method extracts time-series information on the number of starfish from underwater video data. For the extracted starfish quantity information, the model uses the k-means clustering algorithm to divide the starfish prevalence level into four levels: no prevalence, mild prevalence, medium prevalence, and high prevalence. Correlation analysis concluded that the water quality factors most closely related to the starfish prevalence level are temperature and salinity. Therefore, the selected water quality factor and the number of historical starfish are inputted. The future starfish prevalence level of the starfish outbreak is used as an output to train the BP (back propagation) neural network to build EWSP based on multi-sensor fusion. Experiments show that the accuracy rate of this model is 97.26%, whose precision meets the needs of early warning for starfish outbreaks and has specific application feasibility.",10.3389/fmars.2023.1167191

Identifying the Wnt signaling pathway in abalone could provide a basis for elucidating growth and development mechanisms and improving quality. Objective To identify the number, protein physicochemical properties, gene structure, phylogenetic analysis, and expression profiles of the Wnt gene family in abalone. Methods A comprehensive genome-wide analysis was performed to identify the Wnt gene family in the genomes of three abalone species (Haliotis discus hannai, H. rubra, and H. rufescens). Results Ten single-copy Wnt genes were identified in each abalone species, suggesting that the number of Wnt genes was relatively conserved in Haliotis. Eight Wnt gene subfamilies, including Wnt1, Wnt4, Wnt5, Wnt6, Wnt7, Wnt10, Wnt16, and WntA, are present in all three species. Each abalone species contains two species-specific subfamilies (Wnt9 and Wnt11 in H. discus hannai, Wnt2 and Wnt11 in H. rubra, and Wnt2 and Wnt9 in H. rufescens), reflecting polymorphisms of the Wnt genes in Haliotis. Interestingly, gastropods are characterised by the loss of Wnt8, suggesting a potential evolutionary specificity in gastropods. As expected, Wnt3 is absent in all protostomes, including the abalone. In addition, spatio-temporal expression profiling revealed differential expression levels of the Wnt genes at different developmental stages and in different tissues of H. discus hannai. HdWnt5 and HdWntA might participate in several processes during larval development stages, including germ layer formation and body axis elongation. HdWnt5 may be involved in eye and tentacle development. HdWnt10 may be related to muscle development, and HdWnt6 may be involved in shell formation in abalone. Conclusion To our knowledge, the results of this study, which is the first genome-wide investigation of the Wnt gene family in abalone, lay the groundwork for future research on the evolution and function of the Wnt gene family in Gastropoda.",10.1007/s13258-024-01579-7

However, studies exploring the gonadal development and regulatory mechanisms of Haliotis discus hannai are limited. This study aimed to explore whether the vasa gene acted as a molecular marker for germ cells. Initially, the vasa gene was successfully cloned using the cDNA-end rapid amplification technique. The cloned gene had a 2478-bp-long open reading frame and encoded 825 amino acids. Then, a recombinant expression vector was constructed based on the Vasa protein, and an 87-kDa recombinant protein was prepared. Subsequently, a polyclonal antibody was prepared using the purified recombinant protein. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed the titer of the antibody to be >= 512 K. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Vasa was widely expressed in oogonia, Stage I oocytes, spermatogonia, and primary spermatocytes. The specific expression of Vasa in the hermaphroditic gonads of abalone was assessed using western blotting to investigate the effects of different photoperiods (12 L:12D, 24 L:0D, 18 L:6D, and 6 L:18D) on the gonadal development of abalone (P P < 0.05), with higher expression levels observed in the ovarian proliferative and spermary maturing stages compared with other developmental stages (P P < 0.05). Additionally, Vasa exhibited the highest expression in the spermary and ovary under a photoperiod of 18 L:6D (P P < 0.05). These data demonstrated the key role of Vasa in developing germ cells in abalone. They shed light upon the molecular mechanism through which the photoperiod influenced Vasa expression and regulated gonadal development in abalone. The findings might provide theoretical references for analyzing the differentiation pattern of abalone germ cells and the genetic improvement and conservation of germplasm resources.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.134449

With the addition of Aba, the thermodynamic stability and mechanical properties of the scaffolds significantly improved, and the maximum compressive strength and modulus reached 1.34 and 1.89 MPa, respectively, because Aba provided nucleation sites for nanohydroxyapatite (nHAP) to promote mineralization. In vitro cell experiments showed that the hybrid scaffolds had good biocompatibility and promote the proliferation of osteoblasts. In vivo results revealed that the hydroxyapatite of organic matter and trace elements in Aba particles induced the migration of stem cells and active factors to the site of a bone defect. The implantation of 3D-printed scaffolds offered a microenvironment for osteoblast attachment and proliferation, which further promotes osteogenesis-related gene expression, such as bone gamma carboxyglutamate protein (BGLAP), type I collagen (COL1A1), and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), and facilitated the repair of a skull defect. This high-value applications of Aba have the potential to improve environmental pollution and provide potentially low-cost, high-performance bone repair materials for clinical use.",10.1007/s42114-022-00593-1

Plaque titration revealed that these crude polysaccharides efficiently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation with IC50 values ranging from 0.35 to 4.37 mu g/mL. The crude polysaccharide of H. fusiforme showed the strongest antiviral effect, with IC50 of 0.35 mu g/mL, followed by S. horneri and abalone viscera with IC50 of 0.56 and 4.37 mu g/mL, respectively. In addition, immunofluorescence assay, western blot, and quantitative RT-PCR analysis verified that these polysaccharides could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. In Vero E6 cells, treatment with these crude polysaccharides before or after viral infection strongly inhibited the expression level of SARS-CoV-2 spikes, nucleocapsid proteins, and RNA copies of RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase and nucleocapsid.

These narratives also encourage us to acknowledge and take seriously the ongoing significance of anthropomorphism as a way of conceptualizing and relating to the nonhuman world.

"Mann, K; Jackson, DJ",Characterization of the pigmented shell-forming proteome of the common grove snail Cepaea nemoralis,2014,BMC GENOMICS,15,,,,249,"Background: With a diversity of pigmented shell morphotypes governed by Mendelian patterns of inheritance, the common grove snail, Cepaea nemoralis, has served as a model for evolutionary biologists and population geneticists for decades. Surprisingly, the molecular mechanisms by which C. nemoralis generates this pigmented shelled diversity, and the degree of evolutionary conservation present between molluscan shell-forming proteomes, remain unknown. Results: Here, using next generation sequencing and high throughput proteomics, we identify and characterize the major proteinaceous components of the C. nemoralis shell, the first shell-proteome for a pulmonate mollusc. The recent availability of several marine molluscan shell-proteomes, and the dataset we report here, allow us to identify 59 evolutionarily conserved and novel shell-forming proteins. While the C. nemoralis dataset is dominated by proteins that share little to no similarity with proteins in public databases, almost half of it shares similarity with proteins present in other molluscan shells. In addition, we could not find any indication that a protein (or class of proteins) is directly associated with shell pigmentation in C. nemoralis. This is in contrast to the only other partially characterized molluscan-shell pigmentation mechanism employed by the tropical abalone Haliotis asinina. Conclusions: The unique pulmonate shell-forming proteome that we report here reveals an abundance of both mollusc-specific and pulmonate-specific proteins, suggesting that novel coding sequences, and/or the extensive divergence of these sequences from ancestral sequences, supported the innovation of new shell types within the Conchifera. In addition, we report here the first evidence that molluscs use independently evolved mechanisms to pigment their shells. This proteome provides a solid foundation",10.1186/1471-2164-15-249

Allergies to fish and crustaceans were dealt with in the NDA opinion 2004. Molluscs are a large and diverse group, which includes some 100,000 species living in salt water, in freshwater and on land. Some molluscs are an important food source. Molluscs are used as an added ingredient in some processed foods like soups and sauces and in products like surimi. Case reports and patient series indicate that several molluscs, e.g. snail, oyster, clams, mussels, squid, abalone and octopus, can cause food allergic reactions, some of them life-threatening. Prevalence of self-reported mollusc allergy ranges from about 0.15% (4/2716) in school children in France to about 0.4% (or 20% of all seafood allergic cases) in a household survey of 14,948 individuals in the US. A major allergen of most molluscs is the abundant muscle protein tropomyosin, which has been well characterised in several mollusc species. Tropomyosin is an allergen also found in crustaceans, dust mites, and cockroach and other insects. Characterised tropomyosins in molluscs and different crustaceans show similarities but also significant differences in allergenic structures. In addition to tropomyosin, there is evidence that molluscs contain a number of other allergens, but these are poorly defined. Serological and clinical cross-reactivity between mollusc species, as well as between molluscs and crustaceans and house dust mite has been reported. Mollusc allergens do not cross-react with fish allergens. However, there is a possibility that patients reacting to fish infested with the parasite Anisakis might also react to molluscs due to cross-reactivity. Mollusc allergenicity is not reliably reduced by food processing. Tropomyosin allergenicity is heat-resistant. Although the allergenicity of some other mollusc allergens appears to be destroyed by heat treatment, there are also reports of increased allergenicity after heating. There is little information on the lowest dose of mollusc allergen that can cause a clinical reaction.

The structural control performance of the present bio-inspired base isolation system is demonstrated with numerical simulations using both a single-degree-of-freedom model and a multi-degree-of-freedom model under six different samples of earthquake excitations. A comparative study with three other types of existing base isolators reveals that the present bio-inspired tuned mass damper inerter isolation system may be relatively more effective in reducing the displacement, acceleration, input energy ratio and base shear force for the illustrative cases. In addition, a parametric study is performed to explore the effectiveness of the parameters chosen for the structure.

We evaluated the effects of Von Stosch Enrichment (VSE, nitrate-only), F/2 (nitrate-only), and Jack's Special (JS, nitrate and ammonium) on metabolic profiles. D. mollis exhibited elevated energy storage and growth-related metabolites, with JS enhancing creatine production for energy storage and regeneration, alongside increased DNA/RNA synthesis and cell division activity. This suggests D. mollis prioritizes rapid growth and energy demands, supporting broader ecological adaptability. Conversely, P. hecatensis showed higher expression of metabolites linked to amino acid metabolism and protein synthesis, indicating a focus on efficient nitrogen use for protein production, likely advantageous in low-light, high-turbidity conditions. Nitrogen sources significantly influence amino acid metabolism, with JS promoting broader amino acid production and VSE and F/2 stimulating specific metabolites. These species-specific metabolic patterns underscore the flexibility of D. mollis in energy use versus adaptations of P. hecatensis to protein synthesis pathways.

Hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism that influences light spectral composition on the growth performance and molting of S. paramamosain. RNA-seq analysis and qPCR were employed to assess the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of eyestalks from S. paramamosain reared under full-spectrum light (FL), violet light (VL), and cyan light (CL) conditions after 8 weeks trial. The results showed that there are 5024 DEGs in FL vs. VL, 3398 DEGs in FL vs. CL, and 3559 DEGs in VL vs. CL observed. GO analysis showed that the DEGs enriched in the molecular function category involved in chitin binding, structural molecular activity, and structural constituent of cuticle. In addition, the DEGs in FL vs. VL were mainly enriched in the ribosome, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, lysosome, apoptosis, and antigen processing and presentation pathways by KEGG pathway analysis. Similarly, ribosome, lysosome, and antigen processing and presentation pathways were major terms that enriched in FL vs. CL group. However, only the ribosome pathway was significantly enriched in up-regulated DEGs in VL vs. CL group. Furthermore, five genes were randomly selected from DEGs for qPCR analysis to validate the RNA-seq data, and the result showed that there was high consistency between the RNA-seq and qPCR.

In this study, the microstructure of reconstructed shell in H. discus hannai was observed to determine the effects of thermal and acidification stress on shell growth. Three nacre protein genes, Hdh-AP7, Hdh-AP24, and Hdh-perlustrin, were characterized, and their expression pattern during shell repair was measured under thermal and acidification stress and compared with those of two known biomineralization-related genes, Hdh-AP-1 and Hdh-defensin. The stress resulted in aragonite plates with corroded or irregular microstructures. The gene expression of two nacre proteins (Hdh-AP7 and Hdh-AP24), which directly induce crystal formation, were more sensitive to thermal stress than to acidification, but the expression of the regulatory nacre protein (Hdh-perlustrin) and the two known genes (Hdh-AP-1 and Hdh-defensin), which are also related to immunity, showed an interlinked, complex pattern change.

However, the development of IMTA in open water systems may not go as smoothly as anticipated-at least in Weihai, China, some producers who have adopted it would prefer to return to monoculture. This paper explores the problem from the angle of the economic performance by providing an in-depth analysis of costs and revenues generated by kelp monoculture and kelp-mollusk polyculture (IMTA). We find that the monoculture generates higher profits during the same production cycle. Besides inherent defects in system design, the rapidly growing labor cost and depressing selling price of the mollusk conspire to aggravate the economic failure of IMTA. Due to positive environmental externalities, the social benefits associated with IMTA are higher than the private benefits. This implies that there is a role for the government to generalize IMTA to achieve more total benefits. But single policy such as subsidies may backfire, a combination of policies designed to promote IMTA could be effective. Statement of relevance: To study practical problems in aquaculture.

The current study evaluated different substrates to induce settlement in P. aspera, including microalgae strains (Halamphora coffeaeformis, Navicula incerta and Pavlova sp.) and crustose coralline algae (CCA) obtained from limpet shells. The results showed that gametes obtained by dissection and matured artificially using alkalinized seawater baths can produce viable larvae able to metamorphose to juveniles. Feeding was not required during larval development, suggesting lecithotrophy. Early postlarvae were identified by the shedding of the velum, and juveniles were identified by teleoconch and active grazing behaviour. The presence of CCA shortened the timing for settlement and increased the ratio of juveniles. The type and abundance of CCA can influence settlement success. Moreover, the results suggested that settlement and metamorphosis in true limpets (Patellogastropoda) might be triggered by a two-step mechanism, i.e. a first cue influencing the shift between swimming and crawling activity and a second cue determining settlement and metamorphosis to early postlarvae and juveniles.",10.1017/S0025315421000916

While the impacts to foundation species may be of particular concern, these ecological catastrophes underscore the need to examine how whole systems respond to a suite of stressors. The recent climate-driven collapse of the bull kelp forest and recreational red abalone fishery in northern California provides an example of unanticipated ripple and lagged effects in the system, intensifying vulnerabilities and accelerating population and fishery collapse. For this case study, we examined 15 years (2003-2018) of biological survey data on the bull kelp forest ecosystem-before, during, and after an extreme climate event. We document the interactions and complexity of impacts over time, as well as the resulting increased vulnerability of red abalone to additional anthropogenic, biological, and environmental stressors. We observed progressively stronger population-level responses of the red abalone to the marine heatwave and the regional loss of kelp, driving the movement of adults and juveniles in search of food. As food remained scarce, we documented the loss of productivity with diminished gonad and body condition, the absence of larval or newly-settled abalone, mass mortalities, and shoreward shifts in depth distributions. With 40% of the population dead or dying, juvenile and trophy-sized abalone abandoning cryptic habitats, the shift in the distribution to shallower depths increased the vulnerability of red abalone to the fishery. Other anthropogenic, biological, and climate-related stressors that disproportionately impact shallow habitats are now a growing concern for the survivors. For red abalone, previously unanticipated cascading risks include increased wave energy, warming air temperatures, freshwater flooding, landslides, as well as possible oil spills and harmful algal blooms. Climate-driven changes in vulnerability to fishing and environmental stressors present significant challenges for sustainable natural resource management in dynamic stressed systems, and underscore the need for continued system-focused monitoring.

The results of the two flavor evaluations consistently showed that the scores of umami and sweetness were significantly higher in the high glycogen content group. Pacific abalone with a higher glycogen content has a better flavor. A total of 295 substantially differential metabolites were identified between the two groups. Lysine, glutamic acid, glycine, serine, threonine, nucleotides, phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were considered to be the main taste-enhancing components in the high group.

Diatoms were cultivated in petri dishes, and inverted optical microscopy was used to periodically record their abundance. Growth curves were constructed from these data for each culture condition. In addition, at the end of the experiment we performed weight measurements to determine the total production for each of the considered conditions. We found that cultivation in nonsealed (NS) petri dishes (permitting gas exchange) represented the most productive technique. Cell density and biomass varied among light spectra, although this effect was inconsistent.

Cells of strain B2Z047 were Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, motile by flagella, short rod-shaped, and approximately 0.7-0.9 mu m width and 1.2-1.9 mu m length. The optimal growth conditions were determined to be at 30 degrees C, pH 7.0-8.0, and in 3% (w/v) NaCl. A total of 12 potential alginate lyase genes were identified through whole genome sequencing and prediction, which belonged to polysaccharide lyase family 6, 7, 17, and 38 (PL6, PL7, PL17, and PL38, respectively). Furthermore, the degradation products of nine alginate lyases were detected, among which Aly38A was the first alginate lyase belonging to the PL38 family that has been found to degrade alginate. The combination of alginate lyases functioning in the alginate-degrading process was further demonstrated by the growth curve and alginate lyase production of strain B2Z047 cultivated with or without sodium alginate, as well as the content changes of total sugar and reducing sugar and the transcript levels of alginate lyase genes. A simplified model was proposed to explain the alginate utilization process of Agarivorans sp. B2Z047.",10.3390/md20040254

The known protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate was an active inducer of settlement and metamorphosis, whereas H-7, an inhibitor of PKC, inhibited settlement and metamorphosis in response to juvenile hormone III (JH III). JH III and methyl farnesoate (MF) also directly activated, in vitro, both a PKC-like enzyme present in Capitella homogenates and PKC purified from rat brain. In addition, binding studies using the fluorescent PKC inhibitor RIM-1 revealed the presence of a PKC-like enzyme in intact Capitella larvae and juveniles. Settlement and metamorphosis of the larvae was also stimulated by membrane-depolarizing concentrations of KCl. This response to KCl was inhibited by tetraethylammonium. The potassium channel blocker it-aminopyridine induced settlement and metamorphosis, whereas settlement and metamorphosis in response to JH III was inhibited by the potassium channel ionophore nigericin. Settlement and metamorphosis induced by JH III was inhibited by the calcium channel blockers Ni2+, Zn2+, and verapamil, whereas settlement and metamorphosis was induced by the calcium ionophore A23187. These results suggest that in mediating this response, juvenile hormones may cause activation of PKC, leading to subsequent modulation of potassium and calcium channels.",10.2307/1542564

However, little information is available regarding the function of Mpeg1 in the giant triton snail Charonia tritonis. In this study, a homolog of Mpeg1 (Ct-Mpeg1) was identified in C. tritonis. The predicted protein of Ct-Mpeg1 contains several structural features known in Mpegs, including a membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain and single transmembrane region. The Ct-Mpeg1 gene was constitutively expressed in almost all tissues examined except in the proboscis, with the highest expression level observed in the mantle. As a typical pore-forming protein, Ct-Mpeg1 has antibacterial activities against Vibrio (including Vibrio alginolyticus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus). In addition, rCt-Mpeg1 challenge to V. alginolyticus represses the expression of most outer membrane protein synthesis-related genes and genes involved in the TCA cycle pathway, which will lead to reduced outer membrane protein synthesis and less energy capacity. This is the first report to characterize the macrophage-expressed gene 1 protein in C. tritonis, and these results suggest that macrophage-expressed gene 1 protein Ct-Mpeg1 is an important immune molecule of C. tritonis that is involved in the bacterial infection resistance of Vibrio, and this study may provide crucial basic data for the understanding of the innate immunity system of C. tritonis.",10.3390/ijms232113415

Ballistic tests demonstrated that, when subjected to Type 53 API bullet impact at velocities ranging from 780 to 815 m/s, the layered-and-staggered concrete outperformed both steel fiber reinforced bulk concrete and simple layered concrete with comparable compressive strengths in terms of reducing bullet penetration depth. Furthermore, damage in the layered-and-staggered concrete was primarily confined to areas surrounding directly impacted tiles or joints; cracks on the impact face did not propagate radially as observed in bulk concrete but instead deflected along weak interfaces between adjacent tiles. Additionally, crack deflection and bullet yawing were observed in the thickness direction of the layered-and-staggered concrete targets, aligning with expectations for bionic design effects. Incorporating steel micro-fibers into the layered-and-staggered system enhanced individual tile's impact resistance but did not reduce bullet penetration depth. The proposed layered-and-staggered concrete exhibits promising potential for practical applications, particularly in scenarios requiring prompt repair of damaged components.",10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2024.104995

However, overexploitation of abalone, conch, topshell, and limpets has resulted in population declines globally, with numerous species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Various efforts to supplement existing populations by either translocating wild or releasing hatchery-produced stock have suffered from low survival. To understand predictors influencing post-release survival, we conducted a systematic review and quantitative synthesis of literature on marine gastropod releases. Our global review identified 88 studies (575 unique release events) across 18 species. A similar number of releases were conducted in tropical (52 %) and temperate (48 %) regions, although most release events involved either Haliotidae (57 %) or Strombidae (26 %). Most releases used hatchery-produced stock (77 %), highlighting the prominent role of aquaculture. For seven species with sufficient data, we tested the effect of time since release, stock origin (hatchery, translocated), size at release, and density on post-release apparent survival (referred to as 'survival' hereafter), where applicable. Survival declined through time regardless of species. Hatchery-produced and translocated Haliotis fulgens had similar survival post-release, but hatchery-produced Aliger gigas had lower survival probability than translocated stock. Size at release increased survival probability for only two (Haliotis discus and A. gigas) of the seven species. Similarly, density had no effect on the post-release survival of Haliotis rubra, Haliotis rufescens, and A. gigas. Overall, we found low long-term predicted survival across the seven species. Our findings highlight that overcoming low post-release survival is a significant hurdle when rehabilitating depleted stocks of marine gastropods.",10.1016/j.biocon.2025.111153

The objectives of our study were to (1) determine the temporal stability of WS-RLO DNA outside of its abalone host in 14 degrees C and 18 degrees C seawater, (2) develop a standardized protocol for exposing abalones to known concentrations of WS-RLO DNA, and (3) calculate the dose of WS-RLO DNA required to generate 50% infection prevalence (ID50) in the highly cultured red abalone Haliotis rufescens. The WS-RLO stability trials were conducted in October 2016, February 2017, and June 2017. A quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was used to quantify bacterial DNA for 7 d in seawater collected at an abalone farm in southern California, where the pathogen is now endemic. For all trials and temperature treatments, WS-RLO DNA was unstable in seawater for longer than 2 d. To determine an ID50, groups of uninfected juvenile red abalone were subjected to 3-h bath exposures with four concentrations of WS-RLO at 0, 10(3), 10(4), and 10(5) DNA copies/mL. Abalone feces were tested biweekly for the presence of WS-RLO DNA, and abalone tissues were sampled 9 weeks postinfection for histological and qPCR analyses. The ID50 results indicated that our protocol was successful in generating WS-RLO infections; a pathogen dose of 2.3 x 10(3) DNA copies/mL was required to generate a 50% infection prevalence in red abalone tissue. These findings are critical components of disease dynamics that will help assess WS transmission risk within and among abalone populations and facilitate appropriate management and restoration strategies for both wild and cultured abalone species in WS-endemic areas.",10.1002/aah.10102

However, these techniques only provide a semiquantitative assessment of bacterial load. We created a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to specifically identify and enumerate bacterial loads of WS-RLO in abalone tissue, fecal, and seawater samples based on 16S rDNA gene copy numbers. The qPCR assay designed to detect DNA of the WS-RLO was validated according to standards set by the World Organisation for Animal Health. Standard curves derived from purified plasmid dilutions were linear across 7 logs of concentration, and efficiencies ranged from 90.2 to 97.4%. The limit of detection was 3 gene copies per reaction. Diagnostic sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 99.8%. The qPCR assay was robust, as evidenced by its high level of repeatability and reproducibility.

Growth rates were obtained from tetracycline-labeled individuals and changes in size-frequency modes. Periodic collections were made to examine gut contents and the relationship of diet to food availability. The interaction of recruitment and mortality resulted in a dynamic population structure. Mean densities ranged from 6.5 to 12.7 urchins 0.25 m-2. The population consisted primarily of urchins up to 40 mm in test diameter in a size distribution which changed from unimodal to bimodal and back over the 2 yr study. Mortality was temporally variable and related to test diameter. Growth rates were somewhat lower than most previous reports for the species and suggested that most of the population was made up of 1 and 2 yr-old individuals. Diet consisted largely of geniculate coralline algae, with fleshy brown algae becoming important when available as drift.

Although no distinct environmental changes in the cage area were observed, the relocation area had an increased sand content caused by water circulation. In addition, despite the increase in the sediment temperature, the ignition loss decreased while the dissolved oxygen in the sediment increased. In the Q-mode cluster analysis, benthic foraminiferal assemblages were divided into Cluster I, which was affected by seawater circulation, and Cluster II, which was affected by the abalone cages.

Here, we studied the effects of manipulated seawater carbonate chemistry on the acid-base status of scallop Chlamys farreri and abalone Haliotis discus hannai. The haemolymph pH of the tested individuals showed a fast response to acidified seawater incubation, and the pH level was restored to a normal value within 1 h of recovery in control seawater. However, no significant correlation (P > 0.05) was found between haemolymph pH and seawater pCO(2) or pH, while the squared Pearson correlation coefficient (R2) ranged from close to zero to 0.41. In addition, although the pCO(2) level of total alkalinity (TA)lowered seawater was lower than half of that in the control, molluscs eliminated less CO2 (less than 80%) to TA lowered waters than to the control waters. These findings seem to disagree with the crucial role of seawater pCO(2) in influencing the acid-base balance of molluscs. CO2 elimination occurs in the microenvironment, and CO2 first diffuses to limited amounts of seawater that tightly surround the gills, causing dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) accumulation in the ventilation sites, which leads to a sharp increase in the pCO(2) of the surrounding seawater. Moreover, in this microenvironment, the pCO(2) level increases much faster and more greatly if the environmental seawater is acidified or contains a lower level of TA. Therefore, mollusc acid-base status is influenced by rapidly varying pCO(2) levels at the ventilation site, which is largely independent of that of the rest of the incubating seawater. In summary, CO2 elimination by molluscs relies heavily on the carbonate chemistry of environmental seawater, and seawater buffering capacity should be taken into consideration instead of considering only pCO(2) or pH in studying the acid-base balance of marine molluscs.",10.1016/j.marenvres.2023.106018

The deduced amino acid sequences of VpGSTs showed high similarities to counterparts of other species that clustered into the same clades in the phylogenetic analysis. At basal levels of tissue expression, most VpGSTs were highly expressed in hepatopancreas compared with other tissues. All VpGSTs showed differential response profiles depending on the concentrations of various toxicants and exposure times. More notably, the expressions of VpGSTS2 and VpGSTS3 transcripts were significantly up-regulated in hepatopancreas from Cu and B[a]P-exposed animals, indicating that these two sigma VpGSTs were highly sensitive to Cu and B[a]P exposure. However, the expressions of VpGSTM and VpGSTR were significantly induced by Cu or B[a]P exposure, respectively. These findings suggested the role of VpGSTS2, VpGSTS3, VpGSTM and VpGSTR in defense against oxidative stress and highlighted their potential as biomarkers to Cu or B[a]P exposure.

However, with extreme climatic events such as marine heatwaves (MHWs) increasing in frequency and duration, it remains unclear whether MPAs enhance resistance to and recovery from these acute perturbations and how resilience varies across species and ecological traits (e.g. sedentary vs. mobile species). We used 15 years (2007-2021) of kelp forest monitoring data in Isla Natividad, Mexico, to assess the impact, resistance and recovery of the 2014-2016 MHWs on the fish and invertebrate communities inside and outside two fully protected marine reserves. The 2014-2016 MHWs, the most intense and persistent observed in Isla Natividad that coincided with the loss of giant kelp forest, impacted invertebrates but not fish biomass. Marine reserves conferred resistance to the MHWs for the invertebrate communities and wavy turban snails (Megastraea spp.) (J. H. McLean, 1970), as the impact was less severe than in the reference sites. In addition, reserves enhanced the recovery of some species after the MHWs. Inside marine reserves, abalone (Haliotis spp.) (Linnaeus, 1758) and wavy turban snail (benthic sedentary invertebrates) recovered to pre-heatwave biomass after 2 years, and spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) (Randall, 1840) (benthic mobile invertebrate) after 4 years. Outside the reserves, abalone recovered after 3 years, while the other two species never recovered. The warty sea cucumber (Apostichopus parvimensis) (H. L. Clark, 1913) population collapsed after the MHWs and never recovered inside or outside the reserve. Remarkably, abalone biomass had an outstanding and sustained recovery inside reserves, with a fourfold increase in biomass after the MHWs, which was nearly three times higher than the recovery reported outside the reserve. No other species had a sustained recovery after the MHWs, neither inside nor outside the reserve. Our analysis of long-term monitoring data shows that marine reserves cannot fully prevent adverse impacts from extreme climatic events but can enhance species resistance to and recovery from these events. However, benefits conferred by small marine reserves are species-specific and may be limited to species with limited dispersal and localized population dynamics.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

However, many problems have accompanied the rapid development of this industry, including a reduction in near-shore space suitable for culture and the risk of exposure of farms to natural disasters such as typhoons and red tides. In addition, high temperatures and low oxygen levels resulting from global climate change are causing increased abalone mortality in summer. In this review, the culture patterns and characteristics used in different countries are compared with respect to larvae nurseries, intermediate juvenile culture and the grow-out phase. Next, the transitions and challenges in China's abalone culture industry over the past 60 years are summarized. Finally, a coordinated land-sea program for reducing solid waste emissions into the water and increasing carbon sinks is suggested based on the 'Carbon Neutrality' theory. Under the framework of the program, new facilities, technologies and models should be created to achieve increased mechanization and a greater understanding of the abalone aquaculture industry as soon as possible.

This study was performed to investigate whether W-1/O/W-2, double emulsions can be used to enhance the saltiness of cheese without increasing the salt content (W-1 is distilled water or 1% abalone hydrolysate, and W-2 is 1% NaCl or 1% abalone hydrolysate + 1% NaCI solution). We also investigated the effect of adding abalone hydrolysate to the double emulsion as a saltiness enhancer. The cheeses were physico-chemically evaluated to determine curd yield, pH value, moisture content, color, texture, salt release rate, and sensory properties. No significant differences were observed in curd yield, pH value, moisture content, lightness, or redness between the cheeses made with and without the double emulsion. However, in the evaluation of salt release rate, fresh cheese made with double emulsion (W-1 = distilled. water, W-2 = 1% NaCl + 1% abalone hydrolysate) was detected earlier than the control or the other treatments. In the sensory evaluation, fresh cheese made with the double emulsion showed higher scores for saltiness and overall preference than the control or the other treatments.

A detailed bioeconomic model was constructed, which allows the combination of the biological, technological, and economic aspects of genetic improvement. This research focuses on analyzing various traits through an aggregate breeding value and selection index. In this study, the traditional formula of annual genetic gain is used to allow a detailed analysis of biomass future behavior in terms of the intertemporal evolution of the traits analyzed. The results showed that the production program of genetic management in Australian abalone is profitable but only in the very long term, and it is influenced mainly by the progressive increase in the biomass of each abalone and the survival rate. Sensitivity analysis showed that the weight at harvest is the most important trait, suggesting that it is more beneficial for a farmer to focus on genetically improving this trait. In addition, reproductive factors (especially survival from competent larvae until sexual maturity) had a particularly strong impact on the results, much more than the factors related to genetic improvement and economics, such as the discount rate and selling price.",10.1007/s10499-014-9764-8

This study, based on four seasonal field samplings and a laboratory incubation experiment, examined the source and seasonal dynamics of DOM and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in the seawater of fish ( Larimichthys crocea , LC), seaweed ( Gracilaria lemaneiformis , GL) and abalone ( Haliotis sp., HA) culturing zones in Sansha Bay, China. Using three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis (EEMs-PARAFAC), three fluorescent components were identified, i. e. protein -like C1, protein -like C2, and humic-like C3. Our results showed that mariculture activities dominated the DOM pool by seasonal generating abundant DOM with lower aromaticity and humification degrees. Accounting for 40 -95 % of total fluorescent components, C1 (Ex/Em = 300/340 nm) was regarded the same as D1 (Ex/Em = 300/335 nm) identified in a 180 -day degradation experiments of G. lemaneiformis detritus, indicating that the cultured seaweed modulated DOM through the seasonal production of C1. In addition, the incubation experiment revealed that 0.7 % of the total carbon content of seaweed detritus could be preserved as recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon (RDOC). However, fish culture appeared to contribute to liable DOC and protein -like C2, exerting a substantial impact on DOM during winter but making a negligible contribution to carbon sequestration, while abalone culture might promote the potential export and sequestration of seaweed -derived carbon to the ocean. Our results highlight the influences of mariculture activities, especially seaweed culture, in shaping DOM pool in coastal bays.

Its ability to synthesise the protein has eluded the scientists despite hemocyanin's importance as a carrier protein and complex molecule with anti-viral activity. Although a hypothetical model of hemocyanin release from the rhogocytes lacunae was proposed based on colloid-osmotic pressure mechanism, lack of in vitro studies limits further validation of this model. In this study, we aim to investigate the impact of cell culture conditions and nature of hemocyanin biosynthesis of rhogocyte cells dissociated from Haliotis laevigata mantle tissue. Population of cells with different hemocyanin expression levels was profiled using flow cytometry, while hemocyanin concentrations in the media were elucidated by ELISA assay. We demonstrated that addition of lipoprotein supplement into the media resulted in a burst secretion of hemocyanin into the culture media. Over 7 days of culture, the population of cells tagged with hemocyanin antibody increased steadily while hemocyanin release in the media decreased significantly. Variation of culture medium, temperature, growth supplement type and concentration also impacted the cell growth and hemocyanin biosynthesis. These results indicated the possibility of an active process triggered by the addition of supplement to synthesise the protein at the highest amount during the first hour. The current study provides a glimpse of the hemocyanin biosynthesis by rhogocyte that may be significant to understand the cell ability to synthesise supramolecular protein and secretion through lacunae.",10.1007/s00441-022-03577-1

In protocerebrum, aELH-l-ir was detected in the small-and medium-sized neurons of cluster 6, anterior/posterior medial protocerebral neuropils, protocerebral bridge and central body. In deutocerebrum, the aELH-l-ir was observed in small-sized neurons of cluster 9, fibers between small-sized neurons of cluster 10, medium-sized neurons of cluster 11, olfactory neuropil and medial/lateral antenna I neuropils. In tritocerebrum, the medium-sized neurons of cluster 16, the tritocerebral commissure, and tegumental neuropil showed strong aELH-l-ir. In the ventral nerve cord, the aELH-l-ir was detected in the small-and medium-sized neurons of dorsolateral clusters of subesophageal ganglion. There was no aELH-lir in neurons of thoracic ganglion, but aELH-l-ir exhibited a dot-like structure in the subcapsular space around the thoracic neuropils. In abdominal ganglion, the aELH-l-ir was detected in some medium-sized neurons and abdominal neuropils. In the ovary, the aELH-l-ir was detected in the cytoplasm of oogonia, and all steps of developing oocytes. The effect of aELH on ovarian maturation in the crabs was examined by bioassay.

The aELH also enhanced the proliferation of follicular cells as indicated by the increased number of BrdU-labeled nuclei. In addition, the aELH also significantly induced the 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone secretion in the cultured ovarian explant.

Shear tests were conducted on a special fixture with a shear gap of 200 mu m, approximately 100 mu m narrower than the spacing between mesolayers. The shear strength is found to be 36.9 +/- 15.8 MPa with an average maximum shear strain of 0.3. Assuming the majority of failure occurs through tile pull-out and not through tile fracture, the tensile strength can be converted into a shear strength of 50.9 MPa. Three mechanisms of failure at the tile interfaces are discussed: fracture of mineral bridges, toughening due to friction created through nanoasperities, and toughening due to organic glue.

Nacre is intensely studied because its biologically controlled microarchitecture gives rise to remarkable strength and toughness, but the mechanisms leading to its formation are not well understood. Here we present synchrotron spectromicroscopy experiments revealing that stacks of aragonite tablet crystals in nacre are misoriented with respect to each other. Quantitative measurements of crystal orientation, tablet size, and tablet stacking direction show that orientational ordering occurs not abruptly but gradually over a distance of 50 mu m. Several lines of evidence indicate that different crystal orientations imply different tablet growth rates during nacre formation. A theoretical model based on kinetic and gradual selection of the fastest growth rates produces results in qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental data and therefore demonstrates that ordering in nacre is a result of crystal growth kinetics and competition either in addition or to the exclusion of templation by acidic proteins as previously assumed. As in other natural evolving kinetic systems, selection of the fastest-growing stacks of tablets occurs gradually in space and time. These results suggest that the self-ordering of the mineral phase, which may occur completely independently of biological or organic-molecule control, is fundamental in nacre formation.",10.1021/ja8065495

All species were within the size range ingested by juvenile sea urchins, i.e. 6.74-35.89 mu m. Cellular growth rates ranged from 0.44 divisions day(-1) (Rhaphoneis surirella) to 0.73 divisions day(-1) (Navicula seminulum). Eight monocultures of benthic diatoms, mixed diatoms (an equal mixture of the eight species), natural occurring diatoms, and a control (no diatoms) were used as substrata and food to evaluate larval settlement and juvenile growth of S. intermedius. Larval settlement rates differed significantly between experimental substrata after 24 h (p < 0.05) and 48 h (p < 0.01). A significantly higher number of larvae settled on R. surirella (53.34% 2.22 SE) and Nitzschia sp.

Juveniles could detach benthic diatoms with both weak and strong adhesion on the sixth day after settlement when the mouth opened and the teeth could be seen. Greatest growth (test diameter) occurred on N. corymbosa (631.64 pm 1.14 SE). Survival of juvenile was also greatest on N. corymbosa (95.83%+/- 1.05 SE). These results indicate the effectiveness of Nitzschia sp., R. surirella, A. proteus var. oculata and N. corymbosa as single species over mixed diatoms and natural diatoms in larval settlement and juvenile growth of S. intermedius. Thus, Nitzschia sp. has the best potential diet for larval settlement and juvenile growth of S. intermedius. R. surirella can be used as cue to induce larvae settlement, and A. proteus var. oculata and N. corymbosa can be used as food for growing juveniles. Nitzchia sp., R. surirella, A. proteus var. oculata and N. corymbosa can be used as good food by sea urchin hatcheries or nurseries, which have traditionally operated with natural diatom films in China, to improve growth and survival of post-larvae, and increase the consistency of production.

One of these proteins, AP7, has been identified as a participant in nacre (aragonite) fort-nation in the mollusk Haliotis rufescens. However, the role(s) of this protein in aragonite formation is (are) poorly understood, due to the fact that low quantities of this protein are recoverable from the nacre matrix. To overcome this problem, we employed stepwise solid-phase tBOC synthesis to recreate the 66-AA single-chain protein AP7 and utilized this synthetic form for in vitro mineralization studies. We find that the AP7 protein promotes incomplete or interrupted crystal growth and step edge roundening in a concentration-dependent fashion. Using synthetic peptides which represent the 30-AA N-terminal (AP7N) and 36-AA C-terminal (AP7C) subdomains of AP7. we have identified that the mineral modification activity of AP7 is localized to the unstructured. conformationally labile N-terminal subdomain. Interestingly, the 36-AA C-terminal subdomain has no observable direct effect on in vitro calcium carbonate crystal growth; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that AP7C plays an indirect role in AP7 mineralization activity. Qualitative structural studies reveal that AP7, although possessing Zn(II) fingerlike -His-(X)(6)-His,-Cys-(X)(2)-Cys-, and -Cys-(X)(4)-Cys- motifs within its C-terminal region, does not possess the structural characteristics of known Zn(II) finger polypeptides, as evidenced by the presence of an ordered, (x-helical conformation within the C-terminal subdomain of apo-AP7.

These parameters were characterized in both red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and owl limpets (Lottia gigantea) during 5-h exposures, to 3 mg L-1 (14.5 muM) 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol, followed by 5-h recovery periods. In exposed abalone, phosphoarginine decreased by 50%, inorganic phosphate increased by 900%, and the arginine kinase rate constant quadrupled-all compared to controls and consistent with an uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Limpets were less severely impacted, showing no change in phosphoarginine, an increase of only 200% in inorganic phosphate, and an approximate doubling of the arginine kinase rate constant. Adenosine 5' -triphosphate level's remained constant in all control and exposed molluscs. In addition, at the cessation of dosing, all biochemical parameters in abalone returned to preexposure levels within 3-4 h, consistent with rapid depuration, whereas the limpet recovery data were inconclusive. We suggest that the owl limpet's greater tolerance toward the pesticide could result from an increased capability for anaerobic glycolysis, which is required to survive the periodic anoxia associated with residing higher in the intertidal zone. Thus, the natural histories of nontarget organisms should be considered when the effects of pesticide exposure are determined. (C) 2001 Academic Press.",10.1006/pest.2001.2554

This paper describes laboratory experiments on the consumption of urchins by lobsters, and the preferences for different prey species. Small lobsters (<68 mm carapace length) ate no urchins. Larger lobsters ate urchins of all sizes, although small urchins were preferred. The consumption rate was easily sufficient for the lobsters to have caused the documented disappearance of urchins ( and juvenile abalone) in the main abalone fishing area. Lobsters showed a strong preference for mussels over all other prey offered, and for juvenile abalone over urchins, although previous field observations and laboratory experiments have shown that urchins provide shelter for juvenile abalone.

We demonstrated first that after 40-hr labeling, the de novo synthesis of collagen in the cell layer of cultured hemocytes represents 9.48 +/- 1.25% with respect to the total [H-3]proline-labeled protein synthesis. In addition, IGF-I elicited a significant stimulation of collagen synthesis in cultured hemocytes in a dose-dependent manner from 10(-10) to 10(-8) M. The maximal stimulation (10(-9) M) induced an increase of 286 +/- 56% with respect to 100% control. By immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting, we showed that hemocytes present immunoreactive molecules to antibodies directed against the type I fibrillar collagen.

The global impacts of such infections and outbreaks on human and animal health led to a growing number of studies from various countries discussing the prevention, control, treatment, and overall implications of V. parahaemolyticus. Hence, this study aims to retrieve relevant studies on V. parahaemolyticus using a bibliometric analysis to understand current research status, trends, and hotspots regarding this bacteria. Relevant literature was searched across the Scopus database, and the data were subsequently analyzed using Biblioshiny software. In addition, a manual examination was conducted to identify the hosts of V. parahaemolyticus and diseases caused by the bacteria. Overall, 7,096 records were obtained from Scopus from 1963 to 2023. A bibliometric analysis identified 17,220 authors, with China emerging as the global leader. The analysis also highlighted significant keywords such as Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Litopenaeus vannamei, and innate immunity, suggesting a focus on the impact of V. parahaemolyticus on L. vannamei, specifically emphasizing the shrimp's innate immune responses. Host-disease interaction network also uncovered 53 interactions between hosts and diseases involving L. vannamei or Penaeus vannamei as the primary host, with acute hepatopancreas necrosis disease (AHPND) emerging as the most prevalent among them.

The aim of this study has been to assess the effect of two different immersion times 24 h and 18 h on growth, mortality, biochemical and elemental composition of two species of oyster, reared in brackish basin of Valli di Comacchio (Ferrara, Emilia-Romagna, Italy). Juveniles of Ostrea edulis and Magallana (Crassostrea) gigas, were cultivated with off-bottom methods from January to July 2023. At the end of the trial, the mean individual mass presented the same data in M. gigas for both immersion time, unlike O. edulis. In the same period both oyster species, reared for 24 h in immersion exhibited higher shell length compared to those immersed for 18 h; while the mortality rate was greater for the 18 h immersion only for O. edulis. The daily growth rate of oysters immersed for 24 h showed a value three times higher in May, which can be attributed to an increase of temperature and consequently to food uptake. In summary, the biochemical analyses of the edible part showed significant differences for O. edulis and M. gigas. O. edulis reared for 18 h of immersion, had a higher percentage of saturated fatty acids than oysters reared for 24 h of immersion; probably due to an increase in palmitic one. The elemental composition of the shell showed no significant differences for calcium and manganese, while the other elements analyzed showed important differences between 24 h and 18 h for both species. In conclusion, immersion time O. edulis and M. gigas, had a limited impact on edible part of oysters, while the elemental composition of the shell presented some significantly (p < 0.05) differences. The data obtained suggest that of the use of the two immersion times, based on the growth phase of oyster, could be optimal for feed availability and maximal clearance rate. Moreover, the two oyster species reached the commercial size in 6-7 months with both immersion time, which makes Valli di Comacchio a promising site for oyster farming.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.742009
"Badiola, M; Albaum, B; Curtin, R; Gartzia, I; Mendiola, D",Land based on-growing of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) using Recirculating Aquaculture Systems; a case study from the Basque region (Northern Spain),2017,AQUACULTURE,468,,428,441,,"Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is one of the most famous cold-water marine fish species. While the supply of Atlantic cod to European markets is relatively stable, this species continues to represent an interesting, and potentially lucrative, opportunity for commercial-scale aquaculture. Due to fishing restrictions and quota decreases over the last decade, the supply of Spanish-caught cod in European markets has declined, while the local demand for this species has increased. As wild-capture will not grow to meet this increased demand, land-based aquaculture of cod could represent a viable production model to satisfy demand. However, both capital investments and operation costs for a Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS) farm are expected to be high, and therefore, all economic aspects must be taken into account before embarking on design or planning considerations. The influence of thermal control on growth, mortality and product quality also represent an important landmark when considering land-based aquaculture operations. The following represents a feasibility study to analyze the different economic scenarios and biological factors that can influence the business potential of growing this species in RAS. 2500 cod individuals were reared at two different thermal regimes (i.e., controlled and natural range, respectively) through 2 pilot RAS set up in the Basque region (Northern Spain). The experiment lasted 430 days. Statistical differences were found in survival between different thermal regimes but no significant differences were detected within the fall or winter seasons. Daily specific growth rates were significantly different during the summer season with some compensatory growth patterns being observed in the natural thermal regime set up. Likewise, statistical significances were found between the fat contents from both temperatures after the summer period. Conversely, no significant differences were observed at sensorial level between the samples obtained within our pilot experiment and commercial samples from wild origin. Electricity use was found to be one of the most significant economic costs to be considered. The present study represents the first technical feasibility attempt on cod in land-based aquaculture from the north of Spain and demonstrates the technical feasibility to produce on-land based cod in the region, the equivalence of growth patterns with previous studies, the usefulness of the proposed thermal regime management as a tool for this species production, and the key economic parameters and thresholds for a potential feasible commercial activity in the region.

These strains were characterized by an advanced polyphasic taxonomy including genome based taxonomy using multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) and in silico DNA-DNA similarity (in silico DDH). Phylogenetic analyses on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the isolates could be assigned to the genus Vibrio, however they were not allocated into any distinct cluster with known Vibrionaceae species. MLSA based on eight protein-coding genes (gapA, gyrB, ftsZ, mreB, pyrH, recA, rpoA, and topA) showed the vibrios formed an outskirt branch of Halioticoli Glade. The experimental DNA-DNA hybridization data revealed that the five strains were in the range of being defined as conspecific but separate from nine Halioticoli Glade species. The G + C contents of the Vibrio ishigakensis strains were 47.3-49.1 mol%. Both Amino Acid Identity and Average Nucleotide Identity of the strain C1(T) against Vibrio ezurae HDS1-1(T), Vibrio gallicus HT2-1(T), Vibrio halioticoli IAM 14596(T), Vibrio neonatus HDD3-1(T) and Vibrio superstes G3-29(T) showed less than 95% similarity. The genome-based taxonomic approach by means of in silico DDH values also supports the V. ishigakensis strains being distinct from the other known Halioticoli Glade species. Sixteen traits (growth temperature range, DNase and lipase production, indole production, and assimilation of 10 carbon compounds) distinguished these strains from Halioticoli Glade species.

Culture of the cells in 50-mu-M ZnSO4 induced an increase in ras protein p21 levels which were maximal within 1 day. Natural-antibody (NAb) binding was significantly increased following 2 days of cell culture in ZnSO4 and continued to increase up to 4 days. The increased NAb binding returned to uninduced levels within 2 days following the removal of added zinc ions from the culture medium. The cells also exhibited a significant increase in natural killer (NK) cell sensitivity following 2 days in ZnSO4. This was maintained as long as the zinc was in the medium, but returned to uninduced levels within 1 day following its removal. The results show that NAb binding and susceptibility to NK cells increased following ras oncogene expression in 10T1/2 cells and that both parameters were regulated by p21 expression. Repeated i.v. administration of whole-serum NAb prior to tumor inoculation reduced the number of early tumors following s.c. injection of Zn++-induced 2H1 cells into Zn++-treated C3H/HeN mice, consistent with an in vivo role for NAb in the defense against ras-transformed cells. In contrast, small but statistically significant reductions in NAb binding were observed following v-H-ras transformation of NIH 3T3 cells or v-src transformation of 10T1/2. The data argue for an NAb- and NK-cell-susceptible phase of ras-induced tumor development which is a prerequisite for these mediators to contribute to a first line of defense against incipient neoplasia, and suggest that characteristics of the recipient cell and the transforming oncogene are important in determining the natural resistance phenotype.",10.1002/ijc.2910500317

They increase the fracture resistance of the shell by several orders of magnitude, determine the polymorph of CaCO3 deposited, and regulate crystal nucleation, growth initiation and termination. In addition, they are thought to control the shell microstructures. Understanding how these proteins have evolved is also likely to provide deep insight into events that supported the diversification and expansion of metazoan life during the Cambrian radiation 543 million years ago. Here, we present an analysis of SMPs isolated form the CaCO3 shell of the limpet Lottia gigantea, a gastropod that constructs an aragonitic cross-lamellar shell. We identified 39 SMPs by combining proteomic analysis with genomic and transcriptomic database interrogations. Among these proteins are various low-complexity domain-containing proteins, enzymes such as peroxidases, carbonic anhydrases and chitinases, acidic calcium-binding proteins and protease inhibitors. This list is likely to contain the most abundant SMPs of the shell matrix. It reveals the presence of both highly conserved and lineage-specific biomineralizing proteins. This mosaic evolutionary pattern suggests that there may be an ancestral molluscan SMP set upon which different conchiferan lineages have elaborated to produce the diversity of shell microstructures we observe nowadays.

We predicted that fish reared in colder water would exhibit more pronounced trade-offs among growth, development, and immune parameters than fish in warmer water, and that females would have more pronounced trade-offs than males due to increased energy requirements for ovary development. We found immune function and liver investment were positively related in cold-water fish, but unrelated in warmer water fish. Immune function positively covaried with gonadal investment, but was not associated with somatic investment. Gonadal investment was negatively related to somatic investment, but this was driven by females, as there was no relationship between gonad development and somatic growth in males. We also found that the sexes differed in the relationship between gonadal and liver investments, in which females again exhibited a negative association but males exhibited a positive association. These results indicate that developmental investment strategies in cabezon are flexible and may be both context-specific and sex-specific.",10.1139/cjz-2014-0281

"Capinpin, EC","Status of Abalone Fishery and Experiential Mariculture as a Resource Conservation Strategy in Carot, Anda, Pangasinan",2013,SCIENCE DILIMAN,25,1,51,70,,"The study describes the abalone fishery in Carot, Anda, Pangasinan to develop mariculture and to reseed a part of the harvest as a resource conservation strategy. The abalone fishery of Anda is artisanal or small-scale, typified by fishers gleaning or free-diving on shallow rocky areas which are the typical habitat of abalone. Low densities of 1.67 to 8 individuals per 250 m(2) were observed. Local fishers have knowledge of productive fishing areas. Hence, cage culture of abalone in these areas could be a viable resource conservation strategy as they serve as reproductive reserves to supply larvae for continued productivity of the fishing grounds. Abalone mariculture following the Farmer Field School (FFS) concept was explored to address both resource management and economic needs. As a resource enhancement activity, mariculture guarantees that cultured abalone are allowed to grow to maturity before harvested, while some are retained to restock a marine sanctuary. Since mariculture makes possible the aggregation of individuals, the probability that fertilization would take place is increased. As supplemental source of livelihood, abalone is a high-value commodity and its culture can help augment the income of fishers. Small abalone (3-4 cm) can be cultured further for 3-4 months to increase their size and weight. Mariculture should be done from November to May to avoid the rainy season and improve survivorship. The experiential activity was successful because it became a means for the fishers to experience resource management. Under the FFS, the researcher became a facilitator and mentored the cooperators in learning from their experience. The lessons sharpened the fishers' skills in observation, problem-solving, decision-making, and critical thinking. This enabled them to gain an appreciation of their resource.",

To elucidate the functions involved in host specialization, here we aimed at identifying candidate sequences that could have evolved under positive selection among closely related pathogens specialized on different hosts. For this goal, we sequenced c. 17 000-32 000 ESTs from each of four Microbotryum species, which are fungal pathogens responsible for anther smut disease on host plants in the Caryophyllaceae. Forty-two of the 372 predicted orthologous genes showed significant signal of positive selection, which represents a good number of candidate genes for further investigation. Sequencing 16 of these genes in 9 additional Microbotryum species confirmed that they have indeed been rapidly evolving in the pathogen species specialized on different hosts. The genes showing significant signals of positive selection were putatively involved in nutrient uptake from the host, secondary metabolite synthesis and secretion, respiration under stressful conditions and stress response, hyphal growth and differentiation, and regulation of expression by other genes. Many of these genes had transmembrane domains and may therefore also be involved in pathogen recognition by the host.

Aerobic and anaerobic batch reactors, operated at 35 degrees C and pH 7, were fed milled A. nodosum, nutrients and inocula adapted to seaweed degradation.

Probably, the relative large fraction of high molecular weight polyphenols (>10 kDa) in this alga gave efficient binding of proteins during digestion. The anaerobic degradation was greatly stimulated when the polyphenols were fixed with low amounts of formaldehyde. An accumulated content of guluronate in the remaining alginate indicated that Ca-crosslinking also limited the guluronate lyase access to the polymer.

By using chlorophyll fluorescence technology, we investigated variation in the photosystem II (PSII) characteristics of M. pyrifera during development from the gametophyte to juvenile sporophyte stage. During this growth period, both the optimal (F-v/F-m) and effective (YII) PSII quantum yields increased significantly from the haploid gametophyte to diploid sporophyte stages. In addition, by comparing female gametophytes with male gametophytes, we found that female gametophytes were not only larger and more pigmented than the males, but also recorded higher values of F-v/F-m and YII. Our results supplemented information on the life cycle and PSII photosynthetic performance during the early development and confirmed the possibility of artificial seeding technology, both of which may contribute to mariculture of M. pyrifera in China in the near future.",10.1111/are.12327
"Williams, EA; Degnan, SM",Carry-over effect of larval settlement cue on postlarval gene expression in the marine gastropod Haliotis asinina,2009,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,18,21,4434,4449,,"The drastic shift from pelagic larvae to benthic adult form that occurs during marine invertebrate metamorphosis is often induced by intimate interactions between settling larvae and their benthic environment. Larval experience prior to and during metamorphosis can significantly affect adult fitness, but it is presently unknown whether the exact nature of the inductive cue is an experience that matters, or by what mechanism such carry-over effects are mediated. Here we test for carry-over effects of the specific nature of inductive cues on gene expression in metamorphosing postlarvae of the tropical abalone, Haliotis asinina. Postlarvae induced by three different species of coralline algae all successfully undergo metamorphosis, yet the expression profiles of 11 of 17 metamorphosis-related genes differ according to which species of algae the larvae settled upon. Significantly, several genes continue to be differentially expressed for at least 40 h after removal of the algae from the postlarvae, clearly demonstrating a carry-over effect of inductive cue on gene expression. We observe a carryover effect in several genes with varying functions and spatial expression patterns, indicating that each algal species impacts global gene expression in a unique manner. These data unexpectedly reveal that transcriptional modulation of metamorphosis-related genes is contingent upon the precise composition of the benthic microenvironment experienced directly at induction of settlement, and highlight transcription as a mechanism that can mediate between larval and postlarval experiences. For new recruits into an abalone population, metamorphosis clearly does not represent a new transcriptional beginning.",10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04371.x
"Muraoka, D","Eisenia bicyclis bed coverage off Oshika Peninsula, Japan, in relation to sporophyte survival and Strongylocentrotus nudus abundance",2008,JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY,20,5,845,851,,"It has recently been reported that the Eisenia bicyclis beds on the coast of Tomarihama in the Oshika Peninsula in Miyagi Prefecture (northern part of Japan) have been progressively receding from the offshore side of the beds every year. In this study, to determine the factors causing the change in the distribution of E. bicyclis beds as well as the extent of the change, an ecological survey of E. bicyclis and grazing animals was conducted. A 150 m-long fixed line was set up in the rocky coastal area on the Oshika Peninsula in Miyagi Prefecture, and the number of E. bicyclis individuals inhabiting a 1-m width was then measured. In addition, the numbers of individuals of sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus nudus) and abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) were measured. Although the E. bicyclis bed extended to the 64-m point on the fixed line at the time of the survey in August 1999, by July 2001, its lower limit was at the 53-m point; thus, a retreat of the outer edge of the bed of 11 m was observed in 2 years. The density of adult E. bicyclis sporophytes in the bed was reduced from 1.08 to 1.80 individuals (ind.) m(-2), respectively. Juvenile sporophytes were also observed, but most of those that had settled near the lower limit of the bed failed to survive to become adult sporophytes. There were few sea urchins, the main grazing animal on the site, inside the E. bicyclis bed (3.5 ind. m(-2) in October 2001) while there were many near the bed lower limit and on the deep-site side (12.9 ind. m(-2) in October 2001). These results indicate that the high grazing pressure of sea urchins reduced the survival of juvenile sporophytes near the bed lower limit, thus impeding the recruitment of juvenile sporophytes to replace adult sporophytes that died due to senescence, storm action and/or grazing.",10.1007/s10811-008-9337-1

X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analyses of the growth of these flat pearl composites reveal that biomineralization is initiated by the deposition of an organic sheet on the implanted substrate, followed by the growth of a calcite layer with preferred {10.4} orientation and, finally, by the growth of nacreous aragonite. The calcite layer is structurally similar to the green organic/calcite heterolayer of native shell nacre. It comprises 0.2-2.0-mu m-diameter elongated crystallites of typical geological habits in various aggregate arrangements. The shell also contains an external layer of (00.1)-oriented prismatic calcite, which is deposited on one edge of a flat pearl and has a morphology similar to that of the {10.4}-oriented calcite layer. The transition from {10.4}-oriented calcite to aragonite in both the shell and the flat pearl is abrupt. In vitro calcium carbonate growth experiments reveal that a similar calcite-to-aragonite transition is induced by the addition of soluble proteins isolated from the aragonitic nacre. The growth of flat pearls is highly sensitive to physical and chemical properties of the abiotic substrate. Either roughened or hydrophobic substrates result in abnormal arrangements of the basal calcite layer, which are corrected for by a reinitiation of the biomineralization process, beginning with the deposition of an organic sheet. Insertion of flat pearls as substrates, however, results in continued nacre growth without the deposition of an organic sheet and a calcite layer.",10.1021/cm9503285

As the highest value export aquaculture product in NZ, understanding and safeguarding the health of this species is imperative. The identification and characterization of hemocytes can provide useful information regarding the health of this species. Using flow cytometry (FCM), the present study assessed for the first time the use of different antiaggregant solutions and storage times on the immune-related parameters of hemocytes from cultured adult P. canaliculus. In addition, characterization of the immune-related functions of hemocyte subpopulations within the hemolymph were assessed. The two antiaggregant solutions tested (Modified Alserver's, MAS, A and B) maintained similar numbers of hemocytes in circulation over a 60 min period but, reduced the viability (MAS A) and increased the ROS production (MAS B) of the hemocytes compared to hemocytes diluted in cold filtered seawater (FSW). Hemocytes diluted in FSW and kept on ice showed significant aggregation after 2 h and a reduction in viability from 4 h. Three different hemocyte sub-populations were identified, discernible by their relative size and internal complexity: blast-like cells, hyalinocytes and granulocytes, which accounted for approximately 4, 67 and 29% of the total hemolymph population respectively. Granulocytes showed significantly higher reactive oxygen species production, phagocytic capabilities and neutral lipid content compared to hyalinocytes and blast-like cells. Results indicate that maintaining extracted hemolymph in cold FSW, completing analysis of fresh samples within 2 h of extraction and FCM assay incubation times of no longer than 30 min are best to obtain accurate results. Formalin fixation can also be used for future determination of hemocyte sub-populations and internal structures. Results from this study will allow effective future study of the effects of various stressors on P. canaliculus health and lead to improved management and production strategies in this species.",10.1016/j.fsi.2020.05.019

We were interested in isolating such gut bacteria by considering their potential to produce the polysaccharidases required for digestion of brown seaweeds and isolated three different bacteria from the gut of Batillus cornutus. The isolated bacteria were identified as Bacillus sp. JMP-A, Bacillus sp. JMP-B and Staphylococcus sp. JMP-C. The organisms were evaluated for their ability to produce polysaccharidases such as cellulase, alginate lyase, laminarinase and kelp-lyase. Bacillus sp. JMP-A and Bacillus sp. JMP-B showed a clear zone of CMC hydrolysis with a radius 1.10 (+/- 0.057) and 3.88 cm (+/- 0.088), respectively, whereas Staphylococcus sp. JMP-C showed no zone of CMC hydrolysis. SEM analysis confirmed that the ability of the bacterial isolates to degrade kelp differs and is correlated with kelp-lyase production. The cell free extract of the Bacillus sp. JMP-A isolate showed the highest activities of CM-cellulase, alpha-cellulase, laminarinase and kelp-lyase, which were 22.76, 27.10, 66.59 and 64.36 U/mg, respectively. Meanwhile, the amount of sugars released was higher during the saccharification of kelp by dialyzed intracellular enzymes of the bacterial isolates than when dialyzed extracellular enzyme was used.

"Croll, RP",Developing Nervous Systems in Molluscs: Navigating the Twists and Turns of a Complex Life Cycle,2009,BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND EVOLUTION,74,3,164,176,,"Molluscs constitute a richly diversified phylum, containing abundant species that have successfully invaded a variety of habitats. Despite the long-standing importance of its various members as model species for neurobiology, research on the development of the molluscan nervous system has lagged behind that on several other phyla. Recent studies, however, have begun to sketch an overview of neural development during the complex life cycles of these animals, involving multiple larval and postlarval stages and often including processes of torsion and occasionally detorsion affecting the entire body plan. The first neurons appear early in life and innervate a variety of larval organs. The central and peripheral neurons that comprise the adult nervous system generally appear later in larval life. Metamorphosis involves the loss of many neurons and the gain of others, and yet more neurons change to accommodate transitions in modes of locomotion, feeding and habitat. But such largescale transitions do not stop at metamorphosis as massive changes in body size and behavior occur during juvenile and adult stages, and the nervous system must change accordingly to meet the demands of expanding target tissues and the need to generate new behaviors. Work over the years has gradually revealed some of the genes important in molluscan neural development, but recent whole-genome, EST and microarray projects are now allowing much more rapid progress and providing a valuable molluscan perspective for understanding broader issues concerning the evolution of the nervous system across the animal kingdom.

Water temperature is an important environmental stressor which has significant effects on the physiological and biochemical response of scallops. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) plays a key role in defense against various environmental stresses that could damage the cellular and molecular structure of cells. In this study, molecular characterization and expression of HSP90 in M. yessoensis (designated MyHSP90) were analyzed as an indicator to understand the mechanisms of heat shock response in M. yessoensis under temperature stress. The full-length sequence of MyHSP90 cDNA (GenBank accession no. MF196912) is composed of 2639 base pair encoding a 726-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 83.26 kDa. Tissue expression analysis of MyHSP90 genes revealed ubiquitous expression in each tissue examined, and showed a temperature-dependent response, and the expression level was up-regulated significantly in all the six tissues tested (p < 0.05) except gonad. The results will be useful in furthering the understanding of the massive summer mortalities in M. yessoensis under temperature stress. Additionally, MyHSP90 could be used as a potential biomarker in practice to monitor environmental changes in future studies.",

"Coates, CJ; Söderhall, K",The stress-immunity axis in shellfish,2021,JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY,186,,,,107492,"It is a difficult task to describe what constitutes a 'healthy' shellfish (e.g., crustacean, bivalve). Visible defects such as discolouration, missing limbs or spines, fouling, lesions, and exoskeletal fractures can be indicative of underlying issues, senescence, or a 'stressed' animal. The absence of such symptoms is not evidence of a diseasefree or a stress-free state. Now, more than ever, aquatic invertebrates must cope with acute and chronic environmental perturbations, such as, heatwaves and cold shocks, xenobiotic contaminants, intoxication events, and promiscuous pathogens expanding their host and geographic ranges. With that in mind, how does one determine the extent to which shellfish become stressed in situ (natural) or in cultured (artificial) settings to enhance disease susceptibility? Many biomarkers - predominantly biochemical and cellular measures of shellfish blood (haemolymph) - are considered to gauge immunosuppression and immunocompetence. Such measures range from immune cell (haemocyte) counts to enzymic activities and metabolite quantitation. Stressed invertebrates often reflect degraded conditions of their ecosystems, referred to as environmental indicators. We audit briefly the broad immune functions of shellfish, how they are modulated by known and emerging stressors, and discuss these concepts with respect to neuroendocrinology and immunotoxicology. We assert that chronic stress, alone or in combination with microbial, chemical and abiotic factors, increases the risk of infectious disease in shellfish, exacerbates idiopathic morbidity, and reduces the likelihood of recovery. Acute stress events can lead to immunomodulation, but these effects are largely transient. Enhancing our understanding of shellfish health and immunity is imperative for tackling losses at each stage of the aquatic food cycle and disease outbreaks in the wild.",10.1016/j.jip.2020.107492

The aim was to identify the opportunistic species, seasonal variation, relationships with DO, and temperature of epiphytic foraminiferal assemblages under environmental conditions affected by the biodeposits discharged from abalone farming. The results showed that the highest relative abundance of epiphytic foraminifera occurred in September (22.96 degrees C), although the temperature was highest in August (24.37 degrees C); this may be related to the consistently stable high temperatures during this time (22-23 degrees C). There was no direct relationship between DO and epiphytic foraminiferal assemblages. Rosalina bradyi (frequency: 78.6%; species diversity: 0.96; distributed across three areas in July) was found to be an opportunistic species for nutrient enrichment discharged from abalone farming. Epiphytic foraminiferal assemblages of the three areas were varied, from the R. bradyi assemblage in July, to the R. bradyi-Cornuspira involvens or R. bradyi-Murrayinella minuta assemblages in August and September, and to the Glabratella sp.-R. bradyi or Epistominella naraensis-R. bradyi assemblages of January. Species diversity was also increased.

This study developed a simple method of liquid nitrogen vapor freezing to improve post-thaw sperm survival in the spermcasting oyster Ostrea angasi. The results indicate that the permeable cryoprotectants, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethylene glycol (EG) and propylene glycol (PG) were non-toxic to sperm up to 20% concentration and 90 min exposure whereas methanol at 10% or higher was toxic to sperm for any exposure over 30 min. Among the treatments with permeable cryoprotectants, 15% EG produced the highest post-thaw sperm motility. Sperm motility was further improved by the addition of non-permeable cryoprotectants (trehalose and glucose), with 15% EG + 0.2 M trehalose resulting in the highest post-thaw sperm motility among all the combinations evaluated. The durations of 20, 30 and 60 min equilibrations produced a higher post-thaw sperm motility and plasma membrane integrity (PMI) than 10 min. Higher post-thaw motility and PMI were achieved by freezing sperm at the 8 cm height from the liquid nitrogen surface than at the 2, 4, 6, 10 or 12 cm height. Holding sperm for 10 min in liquid nitrogen vapor produced higher post-thaw motility and PMI than for 2, 5 or 20 min. The cryopreservation protocol developed in this study improved both post-thaw motility and PMI of O. angasi sperm at least 15% higher than those cryopreserved using programmable freezing method.

The cDNAs are 1,019 and 827 bp in length and encode proteins of 171 and 173 amino acids, respectively. The 5' UTR of each contains a conserved iron response element (IRE) motif. Sequence analyses reveal that both proteins belong to the H-ferritin family with seven conserved amino acids in the ferroxidase center. Highest expression of Aifer1 is found in the mantle and adductor muscle, while that of Aifer2 is only in the latter tissue. These Aifer genes are differentially expressed following bacterial challenge of the scallop. The expression level of Aifer1 was acutely up-regulated (over 10 fold) at 6 h post-bacteria injection, whereas Aifer2 expression was not significantly changed by bacterial challenge. Both genes were effectively expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), producing proteins of similar molecular weight, approximately 23 kDa. Purified Aifer1 and Aifer2 proteins exhibited iron-chelating activity of 33.1% and 30.4%, respectively, at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Cations, Mg2+, Zn2+ and Ca2+, depressed iron-chelating activity of both proteins. Additionally, the E. coli cells expressing recombinant Aifer1 and Aifer2 showed tolerance to H2O2, providing a direct evidence of the antioxidation function of ferritin.

The resulting structure yields unique mechanical properties. in this study, we focus on the thin viscoelastic layers between the tiles and on their role on the mechanical properties of the shell. Both SEM and AFM show that the thin (similar to 30 nm) organic layer is porous, containing holes with diameter of approximately 50 nm. These holes enable the formation of mineral bridges between adjacent tile layers. The mineral bridges play a pivotal role in growth and ensure the maintenance of the same crystallographic relationship through tile growth in the 'terraced cone' mode. The existence of mineral bridges is consistent with the difference between tensile and compressive strength of the abalone. Mechanical tests with loading applied perpendicular to the plane of the organic layers reveal a tensile strength lower than 10 MPa, whereas the compressive strength is approximately 300-SOO MPa. These nanoscale bridges have, by virtue of their dimensions (SO nm diameter x 30 nm length), a strength that reaches their theoretical value. The calculated tensile strength based on the theoretical strength predicts a bridge density of approximately 2.25/mu m(2). A major conclusion of this investigation is that the role of the organic layer is primarily to subdivide the CaCO3 matrix into platelets with thickness of 0.5 mu m. Its intrinsic effect in providing a glue between adjacent tiles may not be significant. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.jmbbm.2007.03.001

Considering species importance in the analysis (Morisita's index) a different classification resulted. The divergence of the groups may be due to differences in sampling dates, while the correspondence of assemblages from different dates indicates mainly sharing of important (long-lived) species (E. arborea, C. osmundacea, C offlicinalis var. chilensis).

The tumor produced transcripts for interleukin-1 alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma which could explain the patient's B-symptoms. Treatment of mice with monoclonal antibody (HeFi-1) which activates CD30 antigen administered on day 1 after tumor transplantation prevented tumor growth. Treatment with HeFi-1 after tumors had reached a 0.2 cm(3) volume caused tumor growth arrest and prevention of tumor dissemination.

Both dispersants were composed of complex mixtures of anionic and nonionic surfactants and solvents, Median-effect concentration data showed Atherinops tests to be more sensitive to both dispersants than Macrocystis tests, with values ranging from 48.2 to 72.9 ppm (LC50) and 73.0 to 79.4 ppm (IC50), respectively, for Nokomis(R) 3, and from 43.7 to 45.8 ppm (LC50) and 73.0 to 95.9 ppm (IC50), respectively, for Slik-A-Way. A different pattern was seen in NOECs, in which both species showed significantly higher sensitivity to Slik-A-Way than to Nokomis 3 (alpha = 0.05). Comparison of the present data with those previously compiled for the same products with two other species, the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and a mysid (Holmesimysis costata), showed fairly consistent interspecific patterns among three of the four species; Holmesimysis tests were seen to be least sensitive to Nokomis 3 and second most sensitive to Slik-A-Way.

Both the impact of psychological distress on response to treatment in mycosis fungoides (MF) and the effect of treatments on psychological well-being are unclear. Objectives: To evaluate (1) the association between pretreatment psychological morbidity and treatment outcome in early-stage MF and (2) the impact of response to treatment on psychological well-being. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of patients with early-stage MF who started a new stage-directed treatment for their disease. The response was determined using the modified severity-weighted assessment tool, and psychological distress was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ). Participants were followed for 1 year. Results: In all, 24 consecutive patients were recruited. Objective response rate was 71% (17/24), consistent with existing literature. Prior to treatment, 9 patients (38%) had clinically significant psychological distress on the GHQ-12, while 8 (33%) demonstrated high-level worry on the PSWQ. Of these patients, 6 had pathologic scores on both instruments. Patients with significantly less baseline anxiety/depression on the GHQ-12 responded better to treatment than patients with higher levels (P = .004).

The PEF application increased moisture diffusivity by up to 27% in the combined PEF+VMD process. According to the statistical analysis applied to all mathematical models, the Logarithmic model was best fitted to VMD experimental values. In terms of energy consumption, applying PEF+VMD reduced energy consumption by up to 33% of the 120W and 120/260W non-PEF samples.

In this study, our aim was to identify the main pigments and their molecular pathways in the pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera-the species displaying the broadest range of colors. Three inner shell colors were investigated-red, yellow, and green. To maximize phenotypic homogeneity, a controlled population approach combined with common garden conditioning was used. Comparative analysis of transcriptomes (RNA-seq) of P. margaritifera with different shell colors revealed the central role of the heme pathway, which is involved in the production of red (uroporphyrin and derivates), yellow (bilirubin), and green (biliverdin and cobalamin forms) pigments. In addition, the Raper-Mason, and purine metabolism pathways were shown to produce yellow pigments (pheomelanin and xanthine) and the black pigment eumelanin. The presence of these pigments in pigmented shell was validated by Raman spectroscopy. This method also highlighted that all the identified pathways and pigments are expressed ubiquitously and that the dominant color of the shell is due to the preferential expression of one pathway compared with another. These pathways could likely be extrapolated to many other organisms presenting broad chromatic variation.",10.3390/genes12030421

The results showed that the maximum thermal limit of H. squamata is 31.5 degrees C and 33 degrees C is the lethal temperature, the temperature level with the lowest survival rate (0.15). The IPCC predict that sea surface temperature will raise up to 4 degrees C and monthly average sea surface temperature in Indonesia is around 26 - 31 degrees C. That means in the next century average sea surface temperature could be more than the maximum thermal limit of H. squamata.

An increased milling time led to rod-like stable assemblies of aragonite nanoparticles. Selected area electron diffraction investigations revealed that the longitudinal axes in about one-third of these nanoparticle rods were oriented along the crystallographic c-axis of aragonite, indicating oriented attachment of the aragonite nanoparticles.

Ice templating was carried out under large vertical temperature gradient in a custom-built setup, that resulted in large-scale ordered lamellar structure; mainly due to the fast and straightforward self-assembly of platelets during directional solidification. The structural wavelength and lamella thickness, the critical parameters to define the ordered lamellar microstructure, were measured to be 16.23 +/- 2.0 mu m and 2.79 +/- 1.0 mu m respectively. The resultant green scaffold was subsequently pressed (i.e. cold-compaction) in a direction perpendicular to the ice-front growth and sintered at 1550 degrees C/4h. Although the nature of the compression response (before and after intermediate cold compaction step) did not change considerably, but large differences in the strength, work of fracture and modulus were obtained. This is mainly due to the large reduction of porosity as well as large-scale alignment of alumina platelets in bulk, resulted from the additional intermediate cold-compaction step.

However, mechanical damage caused by ice crystals would lead to quality deterioration. Abalone viscera glycopeptide (AVGP) complex was prepared by hydrolysis technology, which exhibited ice recrystallization ability and antioxidant activity. Moreover, effects of AVGP on Ca2+-ATPase activity, total sulfhydryl content, secondary structure of myofibrillar protein (MP), rheological properties, and gel properties of surimi frozen were investigated. Results showed that surimi treated with AVGP could improve the gel strength and rheological properties of surimi, reduce the gel ice crystal holes, and improve the degradation of gel matrix caused by freeze-thaw. AVGP can significantly inhibit the decrease of Ca2+-ATPase activity and total sulfhydryl group content. When the addition of AVGP exceeded 4% (w/w), its freezing protection effect on MP was better than that of commercial antifreeze agents. Moreover, the alpha-helix and beta-fold contents in the 4% AVGP group were significantly higher than those in the control group, indicating that the addition of an appropriate amount of AVGP can protect the secondary structure of MP. Therefore, AVGP could serve as a new food ingredient with antifreeze and antioxidant functions for frozen surimi.

The method was validated in terms of linearity (R-2 = 0.9953 similar to 0.9991), sensitivity (LOD <= 0.6 mu g kg(-1) and LOQ <= 2.0 mu g kg(-1)), precision (RSD <= 12.7%), and recovery (51.7 to 72.3%). With this approach, three randomly chosen batches of Patinopecten yessoensis (P. yessoensis), Haliotis discus (H. discus), and Crassostrea virginica (C. virginica) from the local market were tested. MC-RR and MC-LR were detected to be MCs positive, which were probably induced by the diet of planktonic cyanobacteria. The successfully applied HLB/PDMS-coated SBSE and HPLC-MS/MS method exhibited great advantage in fast analysis of low concentrations of MCs in foods to ensure the safety of shellfish and its products.",10.1007/s12161-018-1152-y
"Ahmad, TB; Liu, L; Kotiw, M; Benkendorff, K","Review of anti-inflammatory, immune-modulatory and wound healing properties of molluscs",2018,JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY,210,,156,178,,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: This review focuses on traditional and contemporary anti-inflammatory uses of mollusc derived products summarising all the in vitro, in vivo and human clinical trials that have tested the anti-inflammatory activity of molluscan natural products. Inflammatory conditions, burns and wounds have been an ongoing concern for human health since the early era of civilisation. Many texts from ancient medicine have recorded the symptoms, signs and treatments for these conditions. Natural treatments are well documented in traditional European medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Siddha and ancient Mediterranean and African traditional medicine and include a surprisingly large number of molluscan species. Materials and methods: An extensive review of the Materia Medico and scientific literature was undertaken using key word searches for mollusc and anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory or wound healing. Results: Molluscs have been used in ethnomedicine by many traditional cultures to treat different aspects of inflammatory conditions. We found 104 different anti-inflammatory preparations from a variety of molluscan species, of which 70 were from the well-documented Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). This traditional use of molluscs has driven the testing for inflammatory activity in extracts from some species in the phylum Mollusca, with 20 in vitro studies, 40 in vivo animal studies and 14 human clinical trials performed to substantiate the anti-inflammatory and wound healing activity of molluscs. Some of these studies have led to the approval of mollusc-derived products to be used as over-the-counter (OTC) nutraceuticals, like Lyprinol and Biolane(TM) from the New Zealand green lipped mussel Perna canaliculus. Conclusion: Natural products provide important leads for the development of pharmaceuticals, including antiinflammatory agents. Only a small proportion of the molluscan traditional medicines have been tested to confirm their anti-inflammatory activity and most screening studies have tested crude extracts from molluscs without any chemical characterisation. This highlights the need for further research to strategically identify the anti-inflammatory compounds in molluscan medicines to provide leads for novel anti-inflammatory drugs in the future.",10.1016/j.jep.2017.08.008

In vitro assays demonstrated the dose-dependent and inhibitory effect of purified hemocyanin against HSV-1 infection in Vero cells with a 50% effective dose (ED50) of 40 to 50 nM and no significant toxicity. In addition, hemocyanin specifically inhibited viral attachment and entry by binding selectively to the viral surface glycoproteins gD, gB, and gC, probably by mimicking their receptors. However, hemocyanin had no effect on postentry events and did not block infection by binding to cellular receptors for HSV. By the use of different mutants of gD and gB and a competitive heparin binding assay, both protein charge and conformation were shown to be the driving forces of the interaction between hemocyanin and viral glycoproteins. These findings also suggested that hemocyanin may have different motifs for binding to each of the viral glycoproteins B and D. The dimer subunit of hemocyanin with a 10-fold-smaller molecular mass exhibited similar binding to viral surface glycoproteins, showing that the observed inhibition did not require the entire multimer. Therefore, a small hemocyanin analogue could serve as a new antiviral candidate for HSV infections.",10.1128/AAC.01738-15

Thus created materials are composites of both, mineral and organic components. The shell of the gastropod mollusc red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) consists of calcite and aragonite layers, each of them containing characteristic biopolymers responsible for biomineralization. In this work, the effect of interstitial green sheet polypeptide, GP, extracted from the green layer of the mollusc red abalone shell, on the process of spontaneous precipitation of calcium carbonate polymorphs, was investigated. Three precipitation systems, in which the initial mineralogical composition of the precipitate was different, have been studied. Thus, in system (1) calcite appeared, in system (2) a mixture of calcite and vaterite was found, while in system (3), ASW, only aragonite precipitated. However, the precipitation kinetic measurements, X-ray diffraction, FT-IR spectroscopy, and light and scanning electron microscopy indicated that the addition of GP in the model systems caused the inhibition of precipitation and change of morphology of crystals as a consequence of GP adsorption on the crystal surfaces and its entrapment into the mineral structure.",10.5562/cca2197

In this study, the full-length cDNA encoding Vg in noble scallop Chlamys nobilis was cloned. The complete Vg cDNA consists of 7760 nucleotides with an open reading frame encoding 2289 amino acid residues. Phylogenetic analysis of Vg gene revealed that Ch. nobilis was clustered together firstly with its sister species Chlamys farreri and another scallop Mizuhopecten yessoensis, then with other mollusks such as oyster and abalone, and finally with vertebrates. Tissue-specific checking results indicated that Vg gene was only expressed in the ovary. At different gonadal development stages, both orange and brown shell color scallops show the same trend that the amount of Vg mRNA expression kept at a high level at the growing stage, then dramatically decreased at the mature stage, and finally resumed to higher level at the post-spawning stage. Another very important finding is that significantly positive correlations existed between the Vg gene expression level and total carotenoids content, as well as total antioxidant capacity. The relationship among them needs further study. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2012.08.031

To achieve this, however, fishers must be able to cooperate with each other. This paper examines the relationship between trust, cooperation and stewardship in five abalone (Haliotis) fisheries in southeastern Australia. Industry-led resource management initiatives are used as indicators of stewardship, sometimes including substantial sacrifice of catch quota. Higher levels of trust and cooperative capacity enabled greater levels of industry-based resource management in four of the five fisheries. In one case, however, high levels of trust and cooperative capacity did not translate into associated levels of resource management. It is suggested that additional factors, such as perceptions of resource condition, are key determinants of resource stewardship. Private property rights may, therefore, be less important than previously argued. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.marpol.2011.02.010

Activity of carbonic anhydrase in gill tissue increased linearly with age of the animals, while no ace variation in activity was noted for the mantle. The circulating level of total calcium increased during the growth of the animals. Calciotropic hormones were radioimmunoassayed in gill, mantle and hemolymph. Only a calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) could be detected and its concentration decreased as a function of growth, both in hemolymph and mantle. No variation in CGRP concentration with age was observed in gill tissue.

The ecological implications for the Point Loma kelp forest community were studied by comparing long term data with conditions during and after the spill. Surface ammonium concentrations within I km of the break were at potentially toxic levels, and light levels were reduced enough to have inhibited kelp germination and growth. However, because of El Nino conditions, it is unlikely that kelp would have germinated in the absence of a spill. Beyond 1 km, high ammonium concentrations benefitted the nutrient-depleted surface canopy of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera). Measured sedimentation rates were significantly higher near the outfall during the spill and were strongly I elated to wave height; water motion, however, prevented sediment accumulation. Bioassays were conducted on a grid of stations surrounding the outfall. There were significant reductions in the density and growth of microscopic sporophytes of Macrocystis outplanted near the outfall during the spill, but this pattern disappeared in samples collected 11 d after the repair was completed and was not observed again. Sediments collected near the outfall during the spill significantly reduced Macrocystis germ tube elongation; a post repair assay showed no differences with respect to the outfall. No significant effects were observed in outplants of juvenile Macrocystis sporophytes, cup corals, and juvenile abalones. Video transects during the spill and subsequent diving observations provided no evidence of sediment accumulation or negative impacts on established animal populations. Kelp population dynamics at the permanent sites were predictable from existing population structure and El Nino conditions. Damage to kelps, apparently resulting from a combination of low light and nutrient conditions with mechanical damage from storms, construction activity, and barge anchor cables, was observed along the outfall immediately adjacent to the break point. Shortly after the outfall was repaired, ztpwelling improved conditions for kelp germination and growth, and the zone of maximum impact developed into a dense kelp forest. Suspension feeders, detritivores and sea urchins, whose natural history indicates they could have been affected by the spill, showed no unusual population changes. In the context of the continuum of disturbances observed in two decades of population studies at Point Loma, the spill was a modest disturbance similar to the natural vagaries of kelp recruitment. We emphasize that this spill was an intense but not chronic impact during an EI Nino event that also stressed control areas. However, it is representative of massive spills in coastal regions, and the fact that a sewage spill of this magnitude had no lasting effects on a kelp forest community is of general interest.",10.1016/0141-1136(94)00008-D

The tree topology resulting from morphological and combined analyses places Betaeus jucundus as sister to all the remaining species of Betaeus and Betaeopsis, rendering Betaeus paraphyletic. On the other hand, Betaeopsis is recovered as monophyletic. Betaeus australis is positioned as sister to the remaining species of Betaeus s. str. (excluding B. jucundus), which is composed of three well-supported and resolved clades. Mapping of biogeographic traits on the combined tree suggests at least two possible historic scenarios. In the first scenario, the North-East Pacific harboring the highest diversity of hooded shrimps (seven species of Betaeus), acted as the center of origin, where species appeared, matured and eventually migrated toward peripheral regions. In the second scenario, Betaeus + Betaeopsis originated in the southern Indo-West Pacific and subsequently colonized the North-East Pacific, where a major radiation involving dispersal/vicariance events took place. The mapping of life history traits (symbiosis vs. free living and gregariousness vs. single/pair living) in the combined tree suggests (1) that different types of symbioses with dissimilar host organisms (sea urchins, abalones, other decapods, spoon worms) evolved independently more than once in the group (in B. jucundus and in various lineages of Betaeus s. str.), and (2) that gregariousness was ancestral in the Betaeus s. str. - Betaeopsis clade and later shifted toward single/pair living in several lineages.

This study examined how different light qualities (blue, white, green, and red light) and intensities (0 and 2-32 mu molm s(-1)) influence the growth and physiological activity of B. areolate juveniles. Changes in the activity of digestive enzymes, such as pepsin (PPS), lipase (LPS), and amylase (AMS), as well as energy metabolic enzymes, such as hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and succinic dehydrogenase (SDH), were also studied. The result showed that juveniles exhibited substantial variations under different light conditions. Specifically, the maximum bodyweight specific growth rates (SGR) under green, blue, red, and white light conditions were 3.56 +/- 0.45 %d(-1), 3.03 +/- 0.68 %d(-1), 3.01 +/- 0.72 %d(-1) and 2.99 +/- 0.73 %d(-1) at light intensities of 2 mu molm(-2)s(-1), 4 mu molm(-2)s(-1), 8 mu molm(-2)s(-1) and 2 mu molm(-2)s(-1), respectively. The shell length SGR, shell width SGR and body weight SGR in the dark group were not statistically different from those in the red light group at 2 mu molm(-2)s(-1) (p > 0.05), while the body weight SGR of the dark group was significantly lower than that in other groups (p < 0.05). At the light intensity of 2 mu molm(-2)s(-1), the activity of PPS in green and blue light was significantly higher than in red light (p < 0.05). The activity of HK in green light was considerably higher than that in darkness (p < 0.05), and there was no significant difference in the activity of LDH between the dark group and the red light group (p > 0.05), although the results of both groups were significantly higher than those of the blue and white light (p < 0.05). In addition, the activity of PPS, AMS, HK, PK, and LDH was considerably higher in darkness than in other light qualities (p < 0.05). Under different light qualities, the activity of all enzymes at the low light intensity was significantly higher than that at the high light intensity (p < 0.05), which coincided with growth characteristics. Therefore, blue and green light promoted the growth of juveniles at low light intensity (2 mu molm(-2)s(-1)), but darkness inhibited their growth. The findings of this study could be used as a foundation for optimizing lighting conditions and figuring out the optimum conditions for the growth and survival of B. areolata.

However, there are no efficient natural food preservatives or biocontrol agents to control V. vulnificus in seafood. In this study, we isolated and characterized a novel bacteriophage VVP001. Host range and transmission electron microscopy morphology observations revealed that VVP001 belongs to the family Siphoviridae and specifically infects V. vulnificus. Phage stability tests showed that VVP001 is stable at a broad temperature range of -20 degrees C to 65 degrees C and a pH range from 3 to 11, which are conditions for food applications (processing, distribution, and storage). In vitro challenge assays revealed that VVP001 inhibited V. vulnificus MO6-24/O (a clinical isolate) growth up to a 3.87 log reduction. In addition, complete genome analysis revealed that the 76 kb VVP001 contains 102 open reading frames with 49.64% G + C content and no gene encoding toxins or other virulence factors, which is essential for food applications. Application of VVP001 to fresh abalone samples contaminated with V. vulnificus demonstrated its ability to inhibit V. vulnificus growth, and an in vivo mouse survival test showed that VVP001 protects mice against high mortality (survival rate >70% at a multiplicity of infection of 1000 for up to 7 days).

Here, we present the results of excavation at three red abalone middens on the northern Channel Islands. Two of these middens, CA-SRI-26 on Santa Rosa Island and CA-SMI-692 on San Miguel Island, are among the older reported red abalone middens, at roughly 8000-7300 cal BP and help fill a significant temporal gap in our understanding of the initial period of intensive red abalone harvest. The third midden, CA-SMI-172, dates to similar to 6300 cal BP and fills a spatial gap on eastern San Miguel Island. When placed in the context of other Channel Island red abalone middens, our analysis demonstrates that people at some of the earliest red abalone middens harvested more red abalone and larger sized individuals than later in time. These data suggest that people likely placed predation pressure on red abalones across the red abalone midden period (8500-3500 cal BP) and that human activities worked in tandem with other environmental changes to influence the disappearance of the red abalone midden phenomenon similar to 3500 years ago.",10.2993/0278-0771-39.2.204

Using Hong Kong. the region's largest entrepot. its a focal point, the trade in shark fins, abalone, beche-de-mer and dried fish is characterized in terms of product history, volume, source fisheries and species composition. Trends identified in the Hong Kong market are interpreted in the context of the larger Chinese market. Shark fin imports grew 6% per year between 1991 and 2000, most likely because of market expansion Mainland China, posing increasingly greater pressures on global shark resources. In contrast, the quantities of dried abalone traded through Hong Kong remained steady, but inferences based on this trend are discouraged by suggestions of increasing preferences for fresh product forms and growing domestic production in Mainland China. Hong Kong's imports of dried beche-de-mer (sea cucumber) have decreased. while the percentage of imports re-exported has remained steady, suggesting that Hong Kong continues as an entrepot for Mainland China despite declining domestic consumption. Few conclusions can be drawn regarding dried fish products, including whole fish and fish maws, because of a lack of product differentiation in customs data, but a market survey was conducted to provide information on species composition. Comparison of Hong Kong dried seafood trade statistics to those of other key trading partners indicates that, in general, Hong Kong's duty-free status appears to encourage more accurate reporting of traded quantities. Under-reporting biases ranged from 24 to 49'% for shark fin and beche-de-mer, respectively. Comparison to United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) databases indicates additional under-reporting for shark fin such that an alternative minimum estimate of world trade is at least twice the FAO estimates in 1998-2000. The results of a survey of Hong Kong traders provide insight into their attitudes toward harvest, economic and regulatory factors, and suggest that conservation efforts are unlikely to emerge from, or be actively supported by, dried seafood trade organizations. The market's apparent sensitivity to economic sentiment, however, reveals an opportunity for consumer education to play a role in shaping future market growth and resource conservation.

How sperm search for and find an egg remains enigmatic. Sperm attraction to egg-derived chemical cues may be significant evolutionarily for maintaining species barriers and important ecologically for increasing gamete encounters. New tools are needed, however, to resolve the functional consequences of these dissolved signal molecules. Freshly spawned eggs from red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) naturally release L-tryptophan, which stimulates chemotactic responses by conspecific sperm. Here, microspheres were manufactured to the approximate size and the same shape as female gametes and formulated to emit controlled doses of chemoattractant, imitating natural L-tryptophan release rates: When experimentally tested for effectiveness, male gametes did not distinguish between chemically impregnated mimics and live eggs, demonstrating that L-tryptophan alone is both necessary and sufficient to promote chemotaxis, and confirming the identity of a native sperm attractant. The techniques that we describe can be used to create synthetic eggs for most animal and plant species, including humans. Egg mimics increase the capacity for experimental manipulation and enable realistic studies of sperm behavior even in the absence of female gametes.",

The differences in cell shape (spherical or rectangular) and arrangement (irregular or constant layered) of the two strains began to appear at lengths of 50 cm where the Sugwawon No. 301 strain had greater numbers of smaller cells than Huangguan No. 1. In addition we established six sequence simple repeats (SSR) genetic markers that clearly distinguish these two strains ofS. japonica.Based on our observations, we speculate that differences in the cell arrangement between strains ofS. japonicawere determined by genetic variation and morphological properties of the two kelp strains.",10.1007/s10811-019-02029-8

The water quality parameters analyzed were dissolved oxygen (mg/L), salinity (%), pH, temperature (degrees C), turbidity (NTU), BOD5 (mg/L), total suspended solids (mg/L), ammonia ( mg/L N-NH4-), nitrite (mg/L N-NO2), nitrate (mg/L N-NO3) and orthophosphates (mg/L PO4-3). Results suggest that highest efficiency in sedimentation stage were found when effluent was left standing for 6 hours, with removal of 94.0%, 93.6%, 41.6%, 74.3%, 47.4% and 56.1% of chlorophyll a, BOD5, N-NH3, N-NO2, N-NO3 and P-PO4, respectively. The best result to remove turbidity from raw effluent was found in the 24 hours treatment with 95.5% removal rate, when compared with rates of 93.5% for 12 hours and 78.4% for 6 hours. In the nutrient absorption stage, highest removal rates were found in the 6 hours treatment with 23.7%, 47.1%, 7.1%, 37.0% and 48.4% for BOD5, N-NH3, N-NO2, N-NO3 and P-PO 4, respectively, when compared to the control tank. Finally, integrating sedimentation and absorption, all treatments showed high removal efficiency. Turbidity for the three settling times tested was of 95.8% (6 h), 96.6% (12 h) and 96.8% (24 h). In the final removal of BOD 5 the best result was observed in the 6 hours treatment, with 90.7% removal rate, when compared to the 12 hours (85.6%) and the 24 hours (81.4%) treatments.

Classical assays that traditionally focus on a limited number of selected endpoints have thus far proven to be of limited success in this regard. Here, we apply H-1-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based chemometric analysis to the marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis to investigate changes in the metabolic profile of digestive gland tissue as a response to exposure to nickel and chlorpyrifos, both as single chemicals and as a mixture. The multivariate data was analysed by principal component analysis and partial least-squares discriminant analysis. The major metabolite changes responsible for the spectral differences observed were related to amino acid, nucleotide and methylamine metabolism in all 3 cases. In addition, novel metabolic profiles were associated with exposure to each chemical and the mixture. Nickel produced changes in energy metabolism while chlorpyrifos resulted in an increase in acetylcholine levels. Mussels exposed to a single compound demonstrated a significantly different response to those given the mixture, where a small antagonistic effect was evident. The study demonstrates the potential of NMR-based metabolomics to provide a rapid and cost-effective screening tool for monitoring the aquatic environment.",10.3354/meps07654

Both viruses cause diseases associated with high mortality rates, resulting in dramatic economic losses in the aquaculture industry. There are currently no effective treatments for either of these two viral diseases. Thus, early, rapid, and accurate diagnosis plays a fundamental role in disease prevention and control in aquaculture. Traditional methods of diagnosis, such as virus culture, enzyme-linked immunoassay, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are either time consuming or require sophisticated temperature control devices. In this study, one sets of specific primers and probes were designed for the real-time quantitative recombinase polymerase amplification (qRPA) detection of AbHV and RGNNV separately. The sensitivity and specificity of detection were evaluated by comparison with detection by conventional PCR and quantitative PCR. The optimal reaction temperature and time for virus detection is 37 degrees C for 20 min. The detection limit is 100 copies per reaction, making this approach faster and more sensitive than qPCR in this study. In a field application, the detection percentage of qRPA was higher than that of qPCR for both AbHV and NNV. Additionally, good correlation was found between qRPA and qPCR detection (R-2 > 0.8).

The basic model, model 1, assumes that all tags have the same recovery rate. An alternative, model 0, allows newly tagged animals to have a different tag recovery rate than previously tagged animals. This feature might be necessary because new tags are less fouled and more visible than previously applied tags and thus have a higher reporting rate. Model 0 accommodates the different recovery rates through the use of additional parameters, which leads to larger standard errors than in model 1. Model 0', a new model, also allows newly tagged animals to have a different tag recovery rate than previously tagged ones. It makes use of a known fouling time (the time it takes for tags on newly tagged animals to have the same visibility as tags on previously tagged animals) to divide the year into two parts. During the first part of the year the tags on newly tagged animals are more visible than those on previously tagged ones, while in the second part all tags have the same visibility. Dividing the year into parts and recording the recaptures in each part avoids the failure of the assumption that the reporting rate is constant for all tagged animals, achieves greater precision, and provides estimates of the survival rate at the end of the second year instead of at the end of the third year (as in model 0). The superiority of model 0' over models 0 and 1 is demonstrated for several cases using Monte Carlo simulation. Simulations were based on the queen conch Strombus gigas fishery of the Turks and Caicos Islands, British West Indies. For that fishery, if the tag reporting rate is altered by 25% or more by fouling, it is beneficial to use model 0' instead of model 1.",10.1080/02755947.2012.661383

Here, we define a systematic relationship between the ability of biomolecules in solution to promote the growth of calcite (CaCO3) and their net negative molecular charge and hydrophilicity. The degree of enhancement depends on peptide composition, but not on peptide sequence. Data analysis shows that this rate enhancement arises from an increase in the kinetic coefficient. We interpret the mechanism of growth enhancement to be a catalytic process whereby biomolecules reduce the magnitude of the diffusive barrier, E-k, by perturbations that displace water molecules. The result is a decrease in the energy barrier for attachment of solutes to the solid phase. This previously unrecognized relationship also rationalizes recently reported data showing acceleration of calcite growth rates over rates measured in the pure system by nanomolar levels of abalone nacre proteins. These findings show that the growth-modifying properties of small model peptides may be scaled up to analyze mineralization processes that are mediated by more complex proteins. We suggest that enhancement of calcite growth may now be estimated a priori from the composition of peptide sequences and the calculated values of hydrophilicity and net molecular charge. This insight may contribute to an improved understanding of diverse systems of biomineralization and design of new synthetic growth modulators.",10.1073/pnas.0605748103

We characterize the first extremely acidic proteins purified from biomineralized aragonite. These abalone nacre proteins are two variants of 8.7 and 7.8 kDa designated AP8 (for aragonite proteins of approximately 8 kDa). The AP8 proteins have compositions dominated by Asx (similar to 35 mol %) and Gly (similar to 40 mol %) residues, suggesting that their structures have high Ca2+-binding capacity and backbone flexibility. The growth of asymmetrically rounded CaCO3 crystals in the presence of AP8 reveals that both proteins preferentially interact with specific locations on the crystal surface. In contrast, CaCO3 crystals grown with nacre proteins depleted of AP8 retain the morphology of unmodified calcite rhombohedra. Our observations thus identify sites of protein-mineral interaction and provide evidence to support the long-standing theory that acidic proteins are more effective crystal-modulators than other proteins from the same biomineralized material.",10.1021/bm049314v

The Capelinhos volcano was formed in 1957/58 during a Surtseyan and partly effusive eruption that added an 2.5 km(2) tephra and lava promontory to the western end of Faial Island (Azores, central North Atlantic). Subsequent coastal and submarine erosion has reduced the subaerial area of the promontory and created a submarine platform. This study uses historical information, photos and marine geophysical data collected around the promontory to characterize how the submarine platform developed following the eruption. Historical coastline positions are supplemented with coastlines interpreted from 2004 and 2014 Google Earth images in order to work out the progression of coastline retreat rate and retreat distance for lava- and tephra-dominated cliffs. Data from swath mapping sonars are used to characterize the submarine geometry of the resulting platform (position of the platform edge, gradient and morphology of the platform surface). Photographs collected during SCUBA and ROV dives on the submarine platform reveal a rugged surface now covered with boulders. The results show that coastal retreat rates decreased rapidly with time after the eruption and approximately follow an inverse power-law relationship with coastal retreat distance. We develop a finite-difference model for wave attenuation over dipping surfaces to predict how increasing wave attenuation contributed to this trend. The model is verified by reproducing the wave height variation over dipping rock platforms in the UK (platform gradient 1.2 degrees to 1.8 degrees) and Ireland (1.8 degrees). Applying the model to the dipping platform around Capelinhos, using a diversity of cliff resistance predicted from known lithologies, we are able to predict erosion rate trends for some sectors of the edifice. We also explore wider implications of these results, such as how erosion creates shallow banks and guyots in reef-less mid-oceanic archipelagos like the Azores.

As in a number of marine invertebrates, inter- and intra-specific interactions are of importance in selecting a habitat, and specific chemical factors are involved. This study focuses on the sediment preferences of larvae and juveniles and includes an assessment of both the positive and negative chemical cues. The data confirm an attraction of juvenile conspecifics to each other during settlement in a gregarious type of positive response, whereas a negative response to sediments that have been populated by adult A. marina exists. Attraction and larval settlement were induced by a number of synthetic chemicals, including fatty acids, amino acids and tripeptides, and by Rhodomonas sp. and Nephtys hombergii populated sand. Aquatic fish food (Tetra-Marine, commercial trout diet) enriched sediment induces settlement at a similar range; this suggests that settlement can be induced non-specifically by water soluble compounds, which may indicate organically enriched and therefore potentially favourable sites for settlement. In A. marina, brominated aromatics (e.g. 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid) inhibit settlement and function as negative cues in a similar way to those described for terebellid polychaetes. Negative cues may be more important than positive cues and their role in substratum choice by invertebrate larvae has been underestimated.",10.3354/meps166187

Two other strains, AG1 and AG3, determined to belong to the genus Francisella were isolated. To determine the virulence of these isolates, juvenile and adult blue mussels were injected with bacterial solutions at high dose and monitored for 11 days. FR22c and FR22d were found to induce 80% mortality in less than seven days. The isolates AG1 and AG3 led to over 50% mortality in adult mussels but only AG1 led to significant mortality in juveniles (41%). FR22c and FR22d, the most virulent isolates, were selected to determine their respective lethal dose at 50% (LD50) in juveniles and adults. This analysis was performed with bacterial solutions ranging from 102 to 106 CFU/mussel and monitored for 30 days. The isolate FR22c was found to be the most virulent. Observed LD50 for the isolate FR22c was 4.14 x103 CFU/juvenile and 3.45 x103 CFU/adult and for the isolate FR22d, 1.89 x104 CFU/juvenile and 1.52 x104 CFU/adult. To confirm Koch's postulate, a selection of moribund, surviving and control animals were plated on specific media. The isolates were reisolated from moribund animals but not from surviving or controls. To confirm the proliferation, a specific real-time PCR was performed. All moribund individuals were positive by PCR. The main Ct values were lower for moribund compared to surviving animals and a dose effect was observed in DNA bacterial load. This study shows that some F. halioticida isolates are able to induce francisellosis in mussels and lead to high mortality, highlighting differences in virulence among the strains.",10.1016/j.aqrep.2024.102135

Whilst NTZs may be considered an essential part of optimal management, few studies have specifically compared the effects of NTZs with those of correctly applied gear and effort controls. A yield-per-recruit (YPR) population model, based on the sedentary abalone Haliotis laevigata, was used to compare the effects of management by minimum landing size (MLS), effort limitation and NTZs, either singularly or in combination. Initially, a minimum basic YPR model was used. Three additional assumptions were sequentially added to the model to see if they affected conclusions drawn from the model. The additional assumptions were the inclusion of: (i) a length-fecundity relationship; (ii) an age-dependent natural mortality function; and (iii) mortality of undersized individuals due to fishery operations. In the absence of undersized mortality caused by fishing, under virtually all conditions the population is best managed with a combination of MLS and effort control, without any NTZs. For simulations that included mortality of undersized individuals in the fished area, under nearly all circumstances NTZs were considered an essential part of optimal fishery management, and management incorporating NTZs greatly increased the sustainable yield that could be taken.",10.1111/j.1467-2679.2007.00246.x

Three qualitative conceptual models were developed and compared; the first and second ones assuming homogeneous and heterogeneous environmental conditions, respectively, and the third expanded one considering eco-social components under the assumption of environmental heterogeneity. For all these models, the factors described by Vasquez [Bot. Mar. 38 (1995) 251] were included in the management plan for the harvesting of brown macroalgae. Based on Levins's Loop Analysis, the system will have a just weakly unstable moving equilibrium if the harvesting activities do not negatively affect the macrophyta's reproduction and recruitment processes. Therefore, coincidence of reproduction and/or recruitment with harvesting must be avoided in a putative management plan. Regarding the qualitative predictions of the system's behaviour after negatively affecting reproduction and recruitment, only an ecological model assuming a heterogeneous environment shows realistic responses in comparison to experimental studies on the same species. This contribution is the first approach considering the dynamical behaviour of L. nigrescens and its surroundings. Nevertheless, further models, based on the same modelling theory, may integrate more variables from social and economical fields in order to improve the scope of this complex system. Further comparative studies should focus on the assessment of the significance of the structural functions of L. nigrescens and other macroalgae for the conservation of this benthic system.

Ion substitution and supplementation experiments with artificial sea water (ASW) have, however, shown that metamorphosis can be induced by elevation of the potassium ion concentration alone. Approximately 19 mM K+ ASW (10mM 'excess') was found to elicit maximal metamorphic responses: 29 and 39 mM K+ ASW had no inductive effect. Choline chloride was also found to induce metamorphosis in a dose-dependent manner, with 10-4 M ineffective, 10-3 M approximately threshold, and 5x10-3 M to 10-2 M optimal. Concentrations of choline > 10-2 M were sub-lethally toxic. That the absence of larval metamorphosis on exposure to 29 and 39 mM K+ ASW was due to inhibition is inferred from interaction experiments with choline: at these concentrations of K+, metamorphosis in response to choline could be abolished. Timed-exposure experiments indicated that artificial induction elicited by elevated K+ and choline involve either separate mechanisms, or different parts of the same pathway. Thus, whilst larvae required to be continuously exposed to 19 mM K+ ASW in order to complete metamorphosis, those exposed to 10-2 M choline would subsequently complete development in normal ASW following only 1-2 h exposure to the inducer. Preliminary experiments failed to specify further the nature of the natural inducer, beyond the confirmation that live intact colonies of the bryozoan Electra pilosa will trigger larvae to metamorphose.",10.1017/S0025315400037395

Additionally, the distribution of virulence patterns over various herds was determined. Not all genes were present in the strains but all of the detected virulence-associated genes were present in combination. Forty-seven (60.3%) isolates carried seven to 10 virulence-associated genes. Further analysis revealed 58 virulence patterns. Different patterns were found within the same herd and among herds, demonstrating that strains with different virulence patterns were able to cause mastitis. Despite the large number of strains with different virulence patterns, strains with identical patterns was found. Detection of virulence-associated genes in individual S. uberis strains isolated from infected animals revealed one to 10 virulence genes. This may indicate that other virulence factors could be involved.

Additionally, we conducted a comparative transcriptome analysis of the black and golden shell color oysters to explore the potential genes and pathways contributing to the golden phenotype in C. gigas. Our results revealed a significant increase in differentially expressed genes in the golden phenotype associated with pathways such as glutathione metabolism, and calcium signaling pathway, suggesting a potential role in the synthesis of pheomelanin.

Many efforts have been focused on investigating mollusk polysaccharides because of their rich content, ease of extraction, diversified sorts, specific structure, various biofunctions and potent activities. To date, many mollusks, especially species of gastropods, bivalves, or cephalopods, have been reported containing polysaccharide compounds in tissues with abundant amount, and most of polysaccharides are obtainable through combining techniques of extraction, separation and purification. The polysaccharides isolated from mollusks appeared with various structural and physicochemical characteristics, ranged from neutral polysaccharides and sulfated polysaccharides, to GAGs series (including Hep/HS, CS/DS, HA and similarities), even to heterogeneous glycan with high molecular weight.

The technique for inducing pearl production in mollusks, which relies on the grafting of a round nucleus and a piece of mantle tissue from a donor within the gonad of a recipient, generates high mortality and rejection rates. Goals. To develop methodological basis for in vitro primary cultivation of mantle cells in the pearl oyster Pinctada mazatlanica, with potential application to pearl production. Methods. Five methods for enzymatic dissociation, three different culture media, two cell substrates, and four osmolarities of the culture medium were evaluated. In vitro intake of calcium by mantle tissue was also quantified through histochemistry and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results. The addition of collagenase I (414 U/mg), at 37 degrees C increased viability and performance of disaggregated cells, which grew better in RPMI-1640 cell medium with poly-D-lysine. Under these conditions, the cells changed from the round-type cell to the fibroblast-type cell by day three and remained viable until day 25. Culture of explants resulted better with RPMI-1640 medium, at 37 degrees C, without poly-D-lysine, and at 0.6 M NaCl, where calcium absorption was evident. Conclusions. These results set the basis of future investigations reformulating new culturing media, evaluating growth factors, and identifying molecules and genes related to biomineralization and synthesis of CaCO3, calcite and aragonite.",

Mass mortality events caused by pathogens can fundamentally alter the structure of wild fish stocks and depress recruitment rates and yield. In the most severe instances, this can precipitate stock collapses resulting in dramatic economic losses to once valuable commercial fisheries. An outbreak of a herpes-like virus among commercially fished abalone populations in the south-west fishery of Victoria, Australia, during 2006-2007, has been associated with high mortality rates among all cohorts. Long-term records from fishery-independent surveys of blacklip abalone Haliotis rubra (Leach) enabled abundance from pre- and post-viral periods to be analysed to estimate stock density and biomass. The spatial distribution of abundance in relation to physical habitat variables derived from high-resolution bathymetric LiDAR data was investigated. Significant differences were observed in both measures between pre- and post-viral periods. Although there was some limited evidence of gradual stock improvement in recent years, disease-affected reefs have remained below productivity rates prior to the disease outbreak suggesting a reduction in larval availability or settlement success. This was corroborated by trends in sublegal sized blacklip abalone abundance that has yet to show substantial recovery post-disease. Abundance data were modelled as a function of habitat variables using a generalised additive model (GAM) and indicated that high abundance was associated with complex reef structures of coastal waters (<15m). This study highlights the importance of long-term surveys to understand abalone recovery following mass mortality and the links between stock abundance and seafloor variability.",10.1111/fme.12145

The results indicated that U. clathrata not only had strong DIN and DIP removal capacities, but also showed a significant inhibitory effect on V. anguillarum, although not reducing the total heterotrophic bacteria.

As the rates of climate change and exploitation accelerate, additive. and synergistic interactions between them are becoming increasingly important to the dynamics of marine ecosystems and the sustainability of marine fisheries. We examine the impacts of climate change and fishing pressure on the stocks of three commonly exploited intertidal invertebrates on Northeast Pacific rocky shores. California sea mussels (Mytilus calfiornianus) are not likely to experience dramatic population shifts in the face of climate change, and the current low levels of exploitation appear to be sustainable. Owl limpets (Lottia gigantea), which grow more slowly, exhibit higher temperature sensitivity, and are preferred targets of fishers, will likely experience considerable reductions in distribution and abundance if temperatures rise and exploitation continues. Black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii) have already experienced dramatic declines directly attributable to over-exploitation and indirectly to warming trends that have exacerbated the effects of a devastating disease. Two generalities emerge from these comparisons. First, differences in life history characteristics result in a wide range of climatic and anthropogenic effects among species. Second, the effects of fishing pressure may unexpectedly magnify the effects of climate change, and vice versa. Synergistic interactions between environmental change and exploitation on rocky shores and in other marine ecosystems present considerable challenges for fisheries managers. The key to successful management and restoration in marine systems lies in developing a mechanistic understanding of the interactions between climate change and fishing pressure and how they affect population and ecosystem dynamics.",

In agreement with previous reports, we found that 10T1/2 cultures, propagated in the resting state for several weeks, spontaneously convert to fat cells at a very low frequency. Downmodulation of endogenous p21ras levels, as a consequence of expression of antisense ras, markedly increased the rapidity and frequency of adipose conversion (6- to 10-fold), which was equivalent in magnitude to that effected by the potent differentiating agent 5-azacytidine. Conversely, overexpression of ras completely inhibited cell differentiation. In addition, adipocytes derived from antisense-ras expressing lines were characterized by a decrease in hormone responsiveness, as well as an apparent deficiency in attaining the terminally differentiated state. These findings suggest that Ras may be a negative regulator of the decision-making step of fibroblast differentiation to adipocytes.

Isolated acrosomal rings contain proteins of various sizes: 35-,48-,63-,75- and 88-kDa. These proteins, called bindins, have identical 24-residue signal peptides and conserved 97-residue N-terminal sequences, and they differ in mass because of the presence of between 1 and 5 tandemly repeated 134-residue fucose-binding lectin (F-lectin) domains. Southern blots suggest that oyster bindin is a single copy gene, but F-lectin repeat number and sequence are variable within and between individuals. Eight residues in the F-lectin fucose-binding groove are subject to positive diversifying selection, indicating a history of adaptive evolution at the lectin's active site. There is one intron in the middle of each F-lectin repeat, and recombination in this intron creates many combinations of repeat halves. Alternative splicing creates many additional size and sequence variants of the repeat array. Males contain full-length bindin cDNAs of all 5 possible sizes, but only one or two protein mass forms exist in each individual. Sequence analysis indicates that recombination and alternate splicing create hundreds, possibly thousands, of different bindin sequences in C. gigas. The extreme within-species sequence variation in the F-lectin sequence of oyster bindin is a novel finding; most male gamete-recognition proteins are much less variable. In experimental conditions oyster eggs have poor polyspermy blocks, and bindin diversity could be an evolutionary response by sperm to match egg receptors that have diversified to avoid being fertilized by multiple sperm.",10.1387/ijdb.082581ss

Because studies have shown that standard tissue processing may cause artifactual shrinkage of mucous layers, cryostat sections and additives to standard fixatives were tested, but we found no change in the thickness of the mucous layers of the limpets compared to routinely processed tissues. Sloughing of the glycocalyx in vertebrate systems removes bound microbes, and alterations of the glycocalyx layers are associated with disease conditions. Sloughing of the glycocalyx on limpets was rarely observed. In one case, the outer mantle of the limpet was covered with silt and the glycocalyx appeared to be detaching. This process could be experimentally induced by dousing the outer mantle with talc particles. The types of secretory cells producing the mucus in each region of the skin were characterized using standard histological stains and lectin staining. Because analysis was hampered by their small size, classification of the types of secretory cells was based on TEM descriptions of granule morphology, which allowed for comparison to the secretory cells described from skin of the abalone. The possible roles of the numerous secretions, and the mechanisms of mucus production and loss, are compared to what is known in vertebrate systems and to our relative lack of knowledge regarding invertebrate systems.",10.1111/ivb.12213

This study was carried out to estimate the strain additive genetic and heterotic effects on harvest body weight in a 3x3 complete diallel cross involving three populations of Portuguese oyster (Crassostrea angulata), two populations from Cat Ba (RIA1) and Nam Dinh, northern Vietnam, and an imported stock from China. Strip spawning was applied to produce full- and half-sib families simultaneously of nine cross-combinations for performance testing at two locations (Cat Ba Island, Hai Phong city and Van Don Island, Quang Ninh province, Vietnam) using two culture systems (single seed' and cultch set'). A total of 7269 individual oysters were examined over a grow-out period of 270days. A linear mixed model was used to estimate strain additive genetic and heterotic effects for body weight at harvest. Ranking of strains based on their additive genetic effects did not differ between the locations and culture systems. The non-additive genetic (heterotic) effects were low and not significantly different from zero for the traits studied among culture systems. There were no significant differences in levels of heterosis for harvest body weight between the two test environments or culture systems. Based on the non-significant heterotic and large additive genetic effects among strains used for this study, a future breeding programme in this species (C.angulata), setting aside issues of diversity, could be based simply on choice among different strains based on their performance.",10.1111/are.13227

These proteins have been shown to preferentially interfere with calcium carbonate mineral growth in vitro. It is believed that both proteins play an important role in aragonite polymorph selection in the mollusk shell. Previously, we demonstrated the 1-30 amino acid (AA) N-terminal sequences of AP7 and AP24 represent mineral interaction/modification domains in both proteins, as evidenced by their ability to frustrate calcium carbonate crystal growth at step edge regions. In this present report, using free N-terminal, C-alpha-amide capped synthetic polypeptides representing the 1-30 AA regions of AP7 (AP7-1 polypeptide) and AP24 (AP24-1 polypeptide) and NMR spectroscopy, we confirm that both N-terminal sequences possess putative Ca (II) interaction polyanionic sequence regions (2 X -DD- in AP7-1, -DDDED- in AP24-1) that are random coil-like in structure. However, with regard to the remaining sequences regions, each polypeptide features unique structural differences. AP7-1 possesses an extended beta-strand or polyproline type II-like structure within the A11-M10, S12-V13, and S28-I27 sequence regions, with the remaining sequence regions adopting a random-coil-like structure, a trait common to other polyelectrolyte mineral-associated polypeptide sequences. Conversely, AP24-1 possesses random coil-like structure within A1-S9 and Q14-N16 sequence regions, and evidence for turn-like, bend, or loop conformation within the G10-N13, Q17-N24, and M29-F30 sequence regions, similar to the structures identified within the putative elastomeric proteins Lustrin A and sea urchin spicule matrix proteins.

I argue that such a staged sequence yields useful information not only for phylogenetic reconstruction and systematics but also for grounding the comparative study of gastropod metamorphosis and life-history evolution. Secretion of juvenile shell follows a retreat of the mantle, so that the first material is deposited beneath the surface of the protoconch rather than at its margin. Growth continues by advance and retreat of the mantle, resulting in progressive imbricate thickening of the shell. The two velar notches fill sequentially. The anterior siphonal canal elongates before accretionary growth begins along the outer lip and before juvenile lip shape and juvenile ornamentation are established. The velum is lost through a combination of gradual disintegration and resorption during the period of secretory reorganization. The larval and early juvenile shells of other gastropods record many kinds of change. Sculptural zonation is common and provides indirect evidence of sequential reprogramming. Additional studies of larvae in culture are required to provide direct evidence and to establish the comparative data base for phylogenetic analysis.",10.2307/3226839

The columellar muscle in the three snails is a flat, sheet-like muscle that originates on the columella of the shell and inserts on the operculum. The muscle was found to comprise a densely packed three-dimensional array of muscular and connective tissue fibers, supporting the hypotheses of previous authors that it functions as a muscular hydrostat. The fiber arrangement is not uniform throughout the entire muscle; instead it includes three regions that grade into one another. Nearest its origin, the muscle consists primarily of longitudinal muscle fibers with few dorsoventral or transverse fibers, and no oblique fibers. The middle portion of the columellar muscle in the region posterior to the head consists of longitudinal, dorsoventral, and transverse fibers wrapped by two opposed layers of oblique fibers. The third region of the columellar muscle extends through the foot and includes longitudinal, transverse, and dorsoventral fibers with a layer of oblique fibers on the dorsal surface. A narrow band of spherical spaces divides the columellar muscle into dorsal and ventral halves in this region. The morphological zonation within the muscle suggests that different regions perform different functions. In addition, compared to a muscle that is circular in cross section, the elliptical cross-sectional shape may increase the muscular force necessary to twist the foot relative to the shell and may decrease the resistance to buckling.",10.2307/3226851

This catalyst also exhibited excellent stability under humid atmosphere (45 % RH) and 5 cycle tests. These excellent behaviors could be contributed to its low bandgap, small crystallite size and large number of oxygen vacancies. In addition, the appeared energy levels prolonged the lifetime of photogenerated carriers to generate more reactive oxygen species to react with pollutants.

This mushroom contains bioactive compounds such as alkaloids, flavonoids, polyphenols, rutin, quercetin, and triterpenoids that act as antidiabetics and anti-inflammatory agents. Research on using P. cystidiosus mushrooms cultivated in Cianjur, West Java, is rare. These mushrooms are only used as daily food; besides that, their activity as antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory has never been reported or investigated. This research aimed to determine and examine the potential of P. cystidiosus mushroom micro encapsulant as an antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory agent. The research method was an experiment using 30 male white rats of Rattus norvegicus with 200 g body weight (BW) that induced streptozotocin (STZ) dose of 45 mg/kg BW, and divided into 6 groups: HGCt (healthy control, no treatment), NGCt (negative control, induced STZ only), PGCt (given metformin 45 mg/kg BW), TGM1 (given microencapsulant 150 mg/kg BW), TGM2 (given microencapsulant 200 mg/kg BW), TGM3 (given microencapsulant 250 mg/kg BW) for 15 d.

M. crenulata is socioeconomically important as it produces a potent immune-stimulating protein, called Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin, which is extracted in vivo and utilized for vaccine development. However, ecological studies are scarce and genetic knowledge of the species needs to be improved. Our objectives were to assemble and annotate the mitogenome of M. crenulata, and to assess its phylogenetic relationships with other marine gastropods and to evaluate its population genetic diversity and structure. Methods: Samples were collected for mitogenome assembly (n = 3) spanning its geographic range, Puerto Canoas (PCA) and Punta Eugenia (PEU), Mexico, and California (CAL), USA. Total DNA was extracted from gills sequenced using Illumina paired-end 150-bp-read sequencing. Reads were cleaned, trimmed, assembled de novo, and annotated. In addition, 125 samples from eight locations were analyzed for genetic diversity and structure analysis at the 16s rRNA and COX1 genes. Results: The M. crenulata mitogenomes had lengths of 16,788 bp (PCA) and 16,787 bp (PEU) and were composed of 13 protein-coding regions, 22 tRNAs, two rRNAs, and the D-Loop region. In terms of phylogeographic diversity and structure, we found a panmictic population that has experienced recent demographic expansion with low nucleotide diversity (0.002), high haplotypic diversity (0.915), and low phi ST (0.047).

Flow cytometry performed on an fine-needle aspiration (FNA) sample [ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirate flow cytometry or flow cytometry performed on an FNA sample (FNAFC)], has been shown to be a valuable adjunct to FNACB in the diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorders of the spleen, kidney, and thyroid. The objective of this study was to appraise FNAFC's utility as an ancillary tool to detect NHL arising in the head and neck region in adult patients.Methods This is a retrospective study involving 52 adult patients with head and neck lymphadenopathies and masses suspicious for lymphoproliferative disorders, who underwent ultrasound-guided FNACB and ultrasound-guided FNAFC between January 2017 and November 2022. Patient demographics, FNACB histopathological and immunophenotypic results, postoperative histopathology results (when available), and follow-up information until May 2023 were reviewed.Results Of the 52 FNACB samples, 23 samples (44.2%) yielded a diagnosis negative for carcinoma, 20 samples (38.5%) were nondiagnostic on account of scant cellularity, 8 samples (15.4%) were suspicious for malignancy, and a single sample (1.9%) was compatible with malignancy. Regarding FNAFC samples, 37 samples (71.2%) were diagnosed as showing no evidence for a lymphoproliferative disorder, 4 samples (7.7%) as nondiagnostic because of insufficient cell count, 4 samples (7.7%) as suspicious for a lymphoproliferative neoplasm, and 7 samples (13.5%) as compatible with a lymphoproliferative neoplasm, most frequently a B-cell lymphoma. 7 of the 11 patients (63.6%) with a suspicious/positive FNAFC result underwent excisional biopsy for additional work up. Postoperative histopathology reports corroborated FNAFC's findings in 6 patients (85.7%), while the remaining patient's (14.3%) suspicious FNAFC result was discordant with postoperative histopathology results. The other 4 patients (36.4%) did not require excisional biopsy as the hemato-oncologist deemed the information provided by the FNAFC as sufficient for the diagnosis and treatment of an NHL in the specific clinical contexts of those patients. All patients with nondiagnostic (due to insufficient cell count), inconclusive, or negative FNAFC (ie, nondiagnostic of a lymphoproliferative disorder) were followed up for a mean follow-up period of 11.9 months (range: 61.2 months; SD: 10.2 months), during which no new lymphadenopathies/masses nor progression was observed.Conclusions FNAFC is a useful and practical supplementary tool in the diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorders in the head and neck region, principally B-cell lymphoma. While conventional FNACB offers a valuable insight into the initial work up of head and neck masses, FNAFC can routinely detect small abnormal cell populations. Furthermore, in specific clinical contexts, it can reliably diagnose NHL, thereby averting the need for an excisional biopsy in a subset of patients.",10.1177/19160216241296127

Here, inspired by the unique suction-cup structures of abalones, a novel adhesive and photo-responsive microparticle (MP) delivery system is developed to treat periodontitis through microfluidic electrospray technology. Such MPs are generated by quickly ionic cross-linking of sodium alginate together with photo-curing of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate of the distorted microfluidic droplets during their high-speed dropping into calcium chloride solution. Attributing to their unique concave structures, the abalone-inspired MPs exhibit desired underwater adhesion ability and stability under running water. In addition, due to the loading of antibiotics minocycline hydrochloride and near-infrared (NIR)-responsive black phosphorus during their fabrication, the resultant MPs can not only eradicate bacteria directly, but also realize a controllable and effective drug release upon NIR irradiation. Based on these features, it is demonstrated from in vivo periodontitis that the abalone-inspired MPs are firmly adhesive and can controlled-release drugs on the tooth, and thus have outstanding antibacterial efficacy against Porphyromonas gingivalis. These results indicate the particular values of the abalone-inspired MPs for oral-related disease treatment.",10.1002/advs.202202829

Trophic mismatches caused by changes in consumer energetics during periods of low resource availability have received far less attention, although this may be common for consumers during winter when primary producers are limited by light. Even less is understood about these dynamics in marine ecosystems, where consumers must cope with energetically costly changes in CO2-driven carbonate chemistry that will be most pronounced in cold temperatures. This may be especially important for calcified marine herbivores, such as the pinto abalone (Haliotis kamschatkana). H. kamschatkana are of high management concern in the North Pacific due to the active recreational fishery and their importance among traditional cultures, and research suggests they may require more energy to maintain their calcified shells and acid/base balance with ocean acidification. Here we use field surveys to demonstrate seasonal mismatches in the exposure of marine consumers to low pH and algal resource identity during winter in a subpolar, marine ecosystem. We then use these data to test how the effects of exposure to seasonally relevant pH conditions on H. kamschatkana are mediated by seasonal resource identity. We find that exposure to projected future winter pH conditions decreases metabolism and growth, and this effect on growth is pronounced when their diet is limited to the algal species available during winter. Our results suggest that increases in the energetic demands of pinto abalone caused by ocean acidification during winter will be exacerbated by seasonal shifts in their resources. These findings have profound implications for other marine consumers and highlight the importance of considering fluctuations in exposure and resources when inferring the emergent effects of global change.",10.1111/gcb.15449

Although initial allergens were found to represent alien or introduced species, e.g. Bermuda grass, maize, lucerne, it later became apparent that indigenous allergens were also allergenic. Other major alien allergens which were imported into our region include oak, plane, pine and eucalyptus trees, the American, German and Oriental cockroaches, and fruits, e.g. kiwi and olive. The first truly African indigenous pollen allergen to be characterised was kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum) followed by buffalo grass (Stenotaphrum secundatum).

A flat pearl method in the presence of the inner-shell film was conducted to evaluate the role of matrix proteins in the initial stages of nacre biomineralization in vivo. We examined the crystals deposited on a substrate and the expression patterns of the matrix proteins in the mantle facing the substrate. In this study, the aragonite crystals nucleated on the surface at 5 days in the inner-shell film system. In the film-free system, the calcite crystals nucleated at 5 days, a new organic film covered the calcite, and the aragonite nucleated at 10 days. This meant that the nacre lamellae appeared in the inner-shell film system 5 days earlier than that in the film-free system, timing that was consistent with the maximum level of matrix proteins during the first 20 days. In addition, matrix proteins (Nacrein, MSI60, N19, N16 and Pif80) had similar expression patterns in controlling the sequential morphologies of the nacre growth in the inner-film system, while these proteins in the film-free system also had similar patterns of expression.

Then, in-vitro calcium carbonate crystallization experiments under the control of these six organic matrices were carried out in the present study. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was utilized to observe the morphology of CaCO3 and Raman spectroscopy as a powerful technique was used to distinguish the crystal polymorph. Influences of the six kinds of organic matrices on the calcium carbonate crystal growth are proposed. ASM of vaterite pearls can induce vaterite to crystallize and WSM of aragonite pearls mediates to produce aragonite crystals. The single AIM membranes of the two pearls have no pronounced effect on the CaCO3 crystallization. Additionally, the crystal size obtained with the additive of WSM of the two kinds of pearls is smaller than that with the additive of ASM. Moreover, self-assembly phenomenon in the biomineralization process and the distorted morphology calcite are observed. Current results demonstrate important aspects of matrix protein-controlled crystallization, which is beneficial to the understanding of nacre biomineralization mechanism.

Some coral planulae have symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.) that probably provide energy in addition to the lipids provisioned within the egg. However, our understanding of the influence of symbionts on the energy metabolism and survivorship of planulae remains limited. This study examines the relative roles of symbiotic dinoflagellate photosynthesis and stored lipid content in the survivorship of the developing stages of the corals Pocillopora damicornis and Montipora digitata. We found that survivorship decreased under dark conditions (i.e. no photosynthetic activity) for P. damicornis and M. digitata at 31 and 22 days after release/spawning, respectively. The lipid content of P. damicornis and M. digitata planulae showed a significant decrease, at a higher rate, under dark conditions, when compared with light conditions. When converted to energy equivalents, the available energy provided by the depletion of lipids could account for 41.9 and 84.7% of larval metabolism for P. damicornis (by day 31) and 38.4 and 90.1% for M. digitata (by day 21) under light and dark conditions, respectively. This finding indicates that not all energy requirements of the larvae are met by lipids: energy is also sourced from the photosynthetic activities of the symbiotic dinoflagellates within these larvae, especially under light conditions. In addition, the amounts of three main lipid classes (wax esters, triglycerides, and phospholipids) decreased throughout the experiment in the planulae of both species, with the wax ester content decreasing more rapidly under dark conditions than under light conditions. The observations that the planulae of both species derive considerable amounts of energy from wax esters, and that symbiotic dinoflagellates enable larvae to use their stores at lower rates, suggested that symbiotic dinoflagellates have the potential to extend larval life under light conditions.",10.1007/s00227-010-1401-0

After 48 hours of labeling, among the [H-3]-D-glucosamine macromolecules synthesized, [H-3]PGs/GAGs represented 43%, divided into 45% heparan sulfate, 37% chondroitin/dermatan sulfate, and 6% hyaluronic acid. Early elution on anion-exchange chromatography of these PGs/GAGs indicated that most of them appeared as undersulfated GAG molecules. De novo synthesis of collagen represents 4.52% +/- 0.84% (SD) with respect to the total protein synthesis. Such a model will facilitate studies on the synthesis of PGs/GAGs and collagen as components of the extracellular matrix and its regulation in Mollusca. Both PGs/GAGs and collagen participate in molecular events that regulate cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. Further studies with this type of in vitro model should provide knowledge about novel aspects of molluscan cell signaling, in relation to extracellular matrix components.",

Blooms are most common in late summer and autumn during warm, calm conditions. The first documented occurrence of a species of Gymnodinium in False Bay was recorded in April 1988. After blooming it maintained low concentrations in False Bay until it bloomed again in March 1989. Cell concentrations in excess of 10(6) cells.l-1 were recorded at various locations in False Bay and Walker Bay. The highest concentrations during both 1988 and 1989 were recorded at Gordon's Bay (17 x 10(6) cells.l-1 on 25 May 1988 and 24 x 10(6) cells.l-1 on 13 March 1989). Peak cell concentrations accompanied calm, warm weather and high sea-surface temperatures (approximately 20-degrees-C). Wind-induced mixing tended to disperse the blooms. These red tides were responsible for extensive faunal mortality, including an estimated 40 tons of abalone in the H. F. Verwoerd marine nature reserve in 1989. In addition, surfers and swimmers suffered eye, nose and throat irritations. Examination showed that the cell shape of the causative organism closely resembles Gymnodinium nagasakiense Takayama and Adachi but that it also shares characteristics with Gyrodinium aureolum Hulburt and Ptychodiscus breve (Davis) Steidinger. The effects of the toxin are not dissimilar to Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning (NSP) associated with P. breve blooms. Water quality in affected areas was examined using a sea-urchin gamete bioassay. Cell concentrations of 0,5 x 10(6) cells.l-1 were found to elicit a toxic response. The waterborne toxins were shown to be heat-sensitive. To date (June 1990) the causative organism is still present in False Bay, albeit in low concentrations.",
"Kelly, MW; Griffiths, JS",Selection Experiments in the Sea: What Can Experimental Evolution Tell Us About How Marine Life Will Respond to Climate Change?,2021,BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN,241,1,30,42,,"Rapid evolution may provide a buffer against extinction risk for some species threatened by climate change; however, the capacity to evolve rapidly enough to keep pace with changing environments is unknown for most taxa. The ecosystem-level consequences of climate adaptation are likely to be the largest in marine ecosystems, where short-lived phytoplankton with large effective population sizes make up the bulk of primary production. However, there are substantial challenges to predicting climate-driven evolution in marine systems, including multiple simultaneous axes of change and considerable heterogeneity in rates of change, as well as the biphasic life cycles of many marine metazoans, which expose different life stages to disparate sources of selection. A critical tool for addressing these challenges is experimental evolution, where populations of organisms are directly exposed to controlled sources of selection to test evolutionary responses. We review the use of experimental evolution to test the capacity to adapt to climate change stressors in marine species. The application of experimental evolution in this context has grown dramatically in the past decade, shedding light on the capacity for evolution, associated trade-offs, and the genetic architecture of stress-tolerance traits. Our goal is to highlight the utility of this approach for investigating potential responses to climate change and point a way forward for future studies.",10.1086/715109

Elucidation of molecular mechanisms of L. vannamei in responding to infection is essential for controlling the epidemic. In the present study, transcriptomic profiles of L. vannamei hepatopancreas were explored by injecting with PBS or V. alginolyticus. Hepatopancreas morphology of L. vannamei was also assessed. The result reveals that compared with the hepatopancreas of PBS group, the storage cells (R-cell), secretory cells (B-cell) and star shaped polygonal structures of the lumen were disappeared and necrotic after challenged by V. alginolyticus at 24 h. Transcriptome data showed that a total of 314 differential expression genes were induced by V. alginolyticus, with 133 and 181 genes up-and down-regulated, respectively. These genes were mainly associated with lysosome pathway, glycerophospholipid metabolism, drug metabolism-other enzymes, cysteine and methionine metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and PPAR signal pathway. Among these pathways, the lysosome pathway, glycerophospholipid metabolism and PPAR signal pathway were both related with lipid metabolism. Therefore, we detected the lipid accumulation in hepatopancreas by Oil Red O staining, TG and CHOL detection and the relative mRNA expression of several lipid metabolism related genes in the hepatopancreas of shrimp after challenge to V. alginolyticus. The present data reveals that lipids from the L. vannamei are nutrient sources for the V. alginolyticus and define the fate of the infection by modulating lipid homeostasis. These findings may have important implication for understanding the L. vannamei and V. alginolyticus interactions, and provide a substantial dataset for further research and may deliver the basis for preventing the bacterial diseases.",10.1016/j.fsi.2022.03.004

Quantitative assessments of these marine resources have developed from simple methods first applied in the 1970s, to models that encompass a wide range of methodologies. The more valuable resources have undergone regular assessments in recent decades, with frequencies closely related to the management approach employed for each fishery. Many of these assessments form the operating models used to simulation-test candidate management procedures. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the assessments of 11 of the most important fisheries resources in South Africa. Some assessments use simple biomass dynamics models, whereas others are a hybrid of age- and length-based models, each designed to model the specific characteristics of the resource and fishery concerned. Many of the assessments have been disaggregated by species/stock and/or area as related multispecies/stock/distribution hypotheses have arisen. This paper explores the similarities and differences in the data available and the methods applied. The review indicates that, whereas the status of three of these resources cannot be estimated reliably at present, the status of six resources is considered to be reasonable to good, whereas that of abalone Haliotis midae and West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii remains poor.",10.2989/1814232X.2015.1070201

Compared to chemosynthetic drugs, ACE inhibitors derived from natural sources such as food proteins are believed to be safer for consumption and to have fewer adverse effects. Some edible mushrooms have been reported to significantly reduce blood pressure after oral administration. In addition, mushrooms are known to be rich in protein content. This makes them a potential source of ACE inhibitory peptides. Hence, the objective of the current study was to isolate and characterise ACE inhibitory peptides from an edible mushroom, Pleurotus cystidiosus. Methods: ACE inhibitory proteins were isolated from P. cystidiosus based on the bioassay guided purification steps, i.e. ammonium sulphate precipitation, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. Active fraction was then analysed by LC-MS/MS and potential ACE inhibitory peptides identified were chemically synthesized. Effect of in vitro gastrointestinal digestions on the ACE inhibitory activity of the peptides and their inhibition patterns were evaluated. Results: Two potential ACE inhibitory peptides, AHEPVK and GPSMR were identified from P. cystidiosus with molecular masses of 679.53 and 546.36 Da, respectively. Both peptides exhibited potentially high ACE inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 62.8 and 277.5 mu M, respectively. SEC chromatograms and BIOPEP analysis of these peptides revealed that the peptide sequence of the hexapeptide, AHEPVK, was stable throughout gastrointestinal digestion. The pentapeptide, GPSMR, was hydrolysed after digestion and it was predicted to release a dipeptide ACE inhibitor, GP, from its precursor. The Lineweaver-Burk plot of AHEPVK showed that this potent and stable ACE inhibitor has a competitive inhibitory effect against ACE. Conclusion: The present study indicated that the peptides from P. cystidiosus could be potential ACE inhibitors. Although these peptides had lower ACE inhibitory activity compared to commercial antihypertensive drugs, they are derived from mushroom which could be easily obtained and should have no side effects. Further in vivo studies can be carried out to reveal the clear mechanism of ACE inhibition by these peptides.",10.1186/1472-6882-13-313

In the present study, we explore membrane order during seasonal and tidal temperature cycles and find that vesicles prepared from gill phospholipids exhibit significant seasonal differences in order that are consistent with homeoviscous adaptation and suggest winter-acclimatization to mean T-b values and summer-acclimatization to upper extreme T-b values or to large cyclic thermal fluctuations, despite repeated resubmergence in sea water at 10 degrees C during both seasons. Phospholipid vesicles prepared from the gills of mussels acclimated for 6 weeks to constant high or low temperatures in the laboratory fail to exhibit temperature-compensatory differences in order, In addition, during the summer, mussels inhabiting high intertidal sites, but not those from low sites, possess the ability to alter membrane order rapidly (within hours), This alteration of order appears to represent a mechanism designed to offset the thermal variations encountered during the tidal cycle, Thus, M. californianus have the ability to adjust membrane order on seasonal as well as hourly time scales and do so on the basis of their height in the intertidal region.",

However, the precise mechanisms by which interspecific variations in sequence foster these adaptive changes remain largely unknown. Here, we compare orthologs of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (cMDH) from marine molluscs adapted to temperatures ranging from -1.9 degrees C (Antarctica) to similar to 55 degrees C (South China coast) and show how amino acid usage in different regions of the enzyme (surface, intermediate depth, and protein core) varies with adaptation temperature. This eukaryotic enzyme follows some but not all of the rules established in comparisons of archaeal and bacterial proteins. To link the effects of specific amino acid substitutions with adaptive variations in enzyme thermal stability, we combined site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) and in vitro protein experimentation with in silico mutagenesis using molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) techniques. SDM and MDS methods generally but not invariably yielded common effects on protein stability. MDS analysis is shown to provide insights into how specific amino acid substitutions affect the conformational flexibilities of mobile regions (MRs) of the enzyme that are essential for binding and catalysis. Whereas these substitutions invariably lie outside of the MRs, they effectively transmit their flexibility-modulating effects to the MRs through linked interactions among surface residues. This discovery illustrates that regions of the protein surface lying outside of the site of catalysis can help establish an enzyme's thermal responses and foster evolutionary adaptation of function.",10.1073/pnas.1817455116

Given increasing human-derived stressors acting on marine ecosystems, the need for such effective action is urgently clear. Here we explore mechanisms underlying the utility of marine reserves to reinstate trophic dynamics and to increase resilience of kelp beds against climate-driven phase shift to sea urchin barrens on the rapidly warming Tasmanian east coast. Tethering and tagging experiments were used to examine size-and shelter-specific survival of the range-extending sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii (Diadematidae) translocated to reefs inside and outside no-take Tasmanian marine reserves. Results show that survival rates of C. rodgersii exposed on flat reef substratum by tethering were approximately seven times (small urchins 10.1 times; large urchins 6.1 times) lower on protected reef within marine reserve boundaries (high abundance of large predatory-capable lobsters) compared to fished reef (large predatory lobsters absent). When able to seek crevice shelter, tag-resighting models estimated that mortality rates of C. rodgersii were lower overall but remained 3.3 times (small urchins 2.1 times; large urchins 6.4 times) higher in the presence of large lobsters inside marine reserves, with higher survival of small urchins owing to greater access to crevices relative to large urchins. Indeed, shelter was 6.3 times and 3.1 times more important to survival of small and large urchins, respectively, on reserved relative to fished reef. Experimental results corroborate with surveys throughout the range extension region, showing greater occurrence of overgrazing on high-relief rocky habitats where shelter for C. rodgersii is readily available. This shows that ecosystem impacts mediated by range extension of such habitat-modifying organisms will be heterogeneous in space, and that marine systems with a more natural complement of large and thus functional predators, as achievable within no-take reserves, will minimize local risk of phase shifts by reinstating size and habitat-specific predator-prey dynamics eroded by fishing. Importantly, our findings also highlight the crucial need to account for the influence of size dynamics and habitat complexity on rates of key predator-prey interactions when managing expectations of ecosystem-level responses within marine reserve boundaries.",10.1890/11-1587.1
"Little, MP; Rosenberg, PS; Arsham, A",Alternative stopping rules to limit tree expansion for random forest models,2022,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,12,1,,,15113,"Random forests are a popular type of machine learning model, which are relatively robust to overfitting, unlike some other machine learning models, and adequately capture non-linear relationships between an outcome of interest and multiple independent variables. There are relatively few adjustable hyperparameters in the standard random forest models, among them the minimum size of the terminal nodes on each tree. The usual stopping rule, as proposed by Breiman, stops tree expansion by limiting the size of the parent nodes, so that a node cannot be split if it has less than a specified number of observations. Recently an alternative stopping criterion has been proposed, stopping tree expansion so that all terminal nodes have at least a minimum number of observations. The present paper proposes three generalisations of this idea, limiting the growth in regression random forests, based on the variance, range, or inter-centile range. The new approaches are applied to diabetes data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and four other datasets (Tasmanian Abalone data, Boston Housing crime rate data, Los Angeles ozone concentration data, MIT servo data). Empirical analysis presented herein demonstrate that the new stopping rules yield competitive mean square prediction error to standard random forest models. In general, use of the intercentile range statistic to control tree expansion yields much less variation in mean square prediction error, and mean square prediction error is also closer to the optimal.

It is harvested in Mexico in small amounts for abalone farm fodder and occasionally exported to Asia for human consumption. Because the high-energy environment where it naturally grows limits its sustainable harvest, we explored the domestication and cultivation of this kelp on the west coast of Baja California, Mexico. The life history of E. arborea was completed in the laboratory following traditional methods for kelp cultivation. Gametophytes became reproductive approximately 50 days after spore release and sporophytes were visible to the naked eye after 80 days. When sporophytes reached 2-3 cm, they were transplanted to two sites on long-line systems: in an open bay (Todos Santos Bay) and in a shallow coastal lagoon (San Quintin Bay). At both sites, full differentiation occurred 6 to 8 months after deployment, with fertile blades occurring within a year. Once individuals reached maximum size, blades were harvested by pruning. Monthly, regrowth of pruned blades and new blade addition were measured. Pruned individuals reached the same weight as controls in three months. On the basis of these results, a seasonal seeding program was implemented at a third site where the presence of natural Eisenia is rare due to the lack of hard substrate but was hypothesized to provide appropriate conditions for kelp cultivation (Santa Maria Bay). Cultures were deployed at three different depths and growth was correlated with season, depth, and temperature. Only cultures seeded in winter developed successfully at this site. This study shows that the culture of E. arborea in a variety of ocean conditions is possible; however, site selection and seasonality are important considerations. Because E. arborea is perennial, it can be harvested periodically during the year thereby increasing yield, and because it is the warmest tolerant kelp species, it is an ideal target for ocean farming and commercial cultivation, considering climate change.",10.3389/fmars.2022.932534

Objective: The aim was to perform a single-laboratory validation of the Neogen rapid test for PST in the hepatopancreas of Southern Rock Lobster. Methods: The AOAC INTERNATIONAL guidelines for the validation of qualitative binary chemistry methods were followed. Three different PST profiles (mixtures) were used, of which two were commonly found in naturally contaminated lobster hepatopancreas (high in gonyautoxin 2&3 and saxitoxin), and the third toxin profile was observed in a few select animals (high in gonyautoxin 1&4). Results: The Neogen test consistently returned negative results for non-target toxins (selectivity). The probability of detection (POD) of PST in the lobster hepatopancreas using the Neogen test increased with increasing PST concentrations.

Bioremediation systems based on coupled bioturbation-microbial processing offer a promising route for waste management. We present, for the first time, a combined biogeochemical-molecular analysis of the short-term performance of one such system that is designed to receive nitrogen-rich particulate aquaculture wastes. Using sea cucumbers (Holothuria scabra) as a model bioturbator we provide evidence that adjusting the waste C : N from 5 : 1 to 20:1 promoted a shift in nitrogen cycling pathways towards the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), resulting in net NH4+ efflux from the sediment. The carbon amended treatment exhibited an overall net N-2 uptake, whereas the control receiving only aquaculture waste exhibited net N-2 production, suggesting that carbon supplementation enhanced nitrogen fixation. The higher NH4+ efflux and N-2 uptake was further supported by meta-genome predictions that indicate that organic-carbon addition stimulated DNRA over denitrification. These findings indicate that carbon addition may potentially result in greater retention of nitrogen within the system; however, longer-term trials are necessary to determine whether this nitrogen retention is translated into improved sea cucumber biomass yields. Whether this truly constitutes a remediation process is open for debate as there remains the risk that any increased nitrogen retention may be temporary, with any subsequent release potentially raising the eutrophication risk. Longer and larger-scale trials are required before this approach may be validated with the complexities of the in-system nitrogen cycle being fully understood.",10.5194/bg-15-1863-2018

Bivalve veligers take up glucose, maltose, cellobiose, and cellotriose but not L-rhamnose, isomaltose, maltotriose, or isomaltotriose. Similarly, gastropod veligers take up glucose and maltose, but not L-rhamnose or maltotriose.

The uptake of complex sugars, in addition to monosaccharides, permits molluscan larvae to utilize a greater part of the dissolved organic material in the sea as a source of nutrition.",10.3354/meps065233

The present studies were undertaken to ascertain whether the abalone enzyme has associated guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins. Membrane fractions were incubated with either islet-activating protein (IAP) or cholera toxin and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the presence of toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylated proteins. The supernatant from a Lubrol PX-extracted 48,000 .times. g pellet fraction contained a Mr = 41,000 IAP substrate. This substrate could not be ADP-ribosylated prior to detergent extraction. Lubrol PX-solubilized fractions of membrane preparations from mouse, bovine, and human sperm also contained a Mr = 41,000 IAP substrate. These proteins co-migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with the Mr = 41,000 .alpha.i-subunit of the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (Gi) from transformed chicken embryo fibroblast and mouse S-49 lymphoma membrane extracts. The sperm IAP substrates displayed similar protease digest patterns to .alpha.i of mouse S-49 lymphoma cells. Sea urchin sperm analyzed in a similar manner contained a Mr = 39,000 IAP substrate. Cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of specific sperm membrane proteins was not observed in any of the sperm preparations tested. The presence of the .beta.-subunit common to both the stimulatory and inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory heterotrimers was confirmed in sperm using an antiserum directed against the purified .beta.-subunit of the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins from bovine brain. It is concluded that all of the sperm tested, with the possible exception of sea urchin sperm, contain a Gi-like protein. Additional properties of these proteins and their role(s) in sperm function are currently being examined.",

The SOM-based two-stage methods are also compared to single-stage approaches applying traditional hierarchical and partitioning algorithms. These comparisons are initially based on the analysis of two reference data sets ( Iris and Abalone) which shows how the use of SOM improves clustering quality while reducing computational time. In order to further evaluate the proposed two-stage method, the comparison is extended to two industrial applications.

Due to intense use in abalone and alginate industries, severe problems of over-harvesting are emerging. We compared sporophyte-initiation and -growth in two populations from northern and southern Chile (Bahia Inglesa and Maicolpue) under laboratory conditions. Irradiance and temperature were the most important factors affecting gametophyte development. Meiospores harvested in spring exhibited maximum reproductive and growth potential, while spores released during autumn were moribund, and died within a few days. In both study sites, we found evidence for acclimation: Meiospores collected in summer required higher levels of irradiance and temperature for maximum development than winter spores. Juvenile sporophytes from both localities responded similarly to temperature and/or irradiance. The best conditions for recruitment of sporophytes from both localities were 15 degrees C and white fluorescent light of 4070molm2s1.

In this study we addressed the question of how the cryptic nature of juvenile T. niloticus can affect survival estimates in experiments to investigate seeding as a tool to enhance overfished stocks. We compared recapture rates of cultured trochus with only a numbered tag with that of flagged trochus, which had both a tag and an additional bright coloured piece of tape glued to the shelf. One experiment was done at Orpheus Island in Australia, and another at Moso Island in Vanuatu. For each experiment the areas were censused 2 or 3 days after release. At Orpheus Island, 76% of the flagged trochus were recaptured compared with 52% of the unflagged trochus. Corresponding values for Moso Island were 68% for flagged trochus and 56% for unflagged trochus. This pattern of higher recapture of flagged trochus was highly consistent among experimental plots, supporting the hypothesis that a significant proportion of the trochus are overlooked by the observer. Mean sighting probability of trochus after 2-3 days was 0.69 at Orpheus Island for an average size of 23 mm shell width (SW), and 0.81 at Moso Island for an average juvenile size of 30 mm SW. Without appropriate correction, survival rates could be underestimated by 30% at Orpheus Island and 19% at Moso Island. As indicated by our results, sighting probability will vary with locality and size.

"Hart, AM","Commercial scale invertebrate fisheries enhancement in Australia: Experiences, challenges and opportunities",2015,MARINE POLICY,62,,82,93,,"Stock enhancement or assisted recruitment for fisheries management in Australia is at an experimental R&D phase. Development of the science has focused largely on finfish targeted by the recreational sector; however it is considered that high value invertebrates will be the best candidates for commercial scale fisheries enhancement. Three main ingredients are required; technical capacity, governance capability, and the 'correct' species. The technical capacity needed is in the area of hatchery production and wild release methodologies, whilst the governance capability needed is informed policy that accounts for the complexities and interdisciplinary nature of stock enhancement. In particular, the appropriate articulation of policy to support economic development and integration into wild fisheries is currently lacking. If successful stock enhancement is implemented, the nature of fisheries management changes because the recruitment side of the fisheries equation is under substantial control, rather than just the production side. Management responses will require significant innovation, with a renewed emphasis on understanding the stock, rather than policing the fishers. By way of illustration, recent initiatives and key challenges encountered in Australian invertebrate fisheries are investigated through case studies. An example of a commercially-viable enhancement fishery that reflects solutions to the key challenges is also presented. The review ends with an argument to re-establish the context of stock enhancement in the discipline of ecological enhancement. This is a crucial and positive step forward for it recognises that, in principle, any renewable aquatic ecosystem has the potential to be enhanced instead of just depleted.

We initiated a breeding program to improve the heat tolerance of the C. gigas by backcrossing with the heat-adapted congeneric species, Crassostrea angulata. In addition, the parents of each generation of the backcross were selected by exposing to acute stress of extreme high temperature. The summer survival rate of the selected backcross populations (BC1, BC2 and BC3 representing different generations) were significantly higher than that of C. gigas. Compared to C. gigas heat stress at 37 degrees C for 12 h, BC3 exhibited significantly lower oxygen consumption rates and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, which indicated that the selected backcross populations exhibited superior tolerance to high-temperature conditions. Additionally, the phylogenetic analysis results demonstrate that the selected backcross populations were distinctly separable from the C. gigas, and 11 candidate genes (Aldo, GPX, PKA, glpK, AGK, DGK, sPLA2, Pcyt2, PARP, TRAF2, and VDAC1) mediating heat tolerance differentiation were identified through selective sweep analysis and gene expression differentiation analysis between populations with divergent heat tolerance. Our results confirm that the breeding strategy of interspecies backcrossing in combination with artificial selection will not only offer breeding approach for genetic improvement for the heat tolerance of the C. gigas, but also provide new insights into the genetic basis of heat tolerance traits for marine animals.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2025.742331

However, it remains unclear whether differences in pathogenicity between different V. mediterranei strains are associated with ECP compositions. In this study, genomics and proteomics approaches were integrated to compare the virulence factors in the ECP proteins secreted by two high-virulence V. mediterranei strains and one low-virulence strain. We found that the ECPs secreted by high-virulence V. mediterranei strains had a greater number and variety of virulence factors compared to low-virulence strains, and that 73 of the 95 specific ECP proteins in the high-virulence strains were not expressed in the low-virulence strain. These findings provide further insights into the role that virulent ECPs play in the pathogenesis of V. mediterranei to bivalves. Abstract Vibrio mediterranei, a bacterial pathogen of bivalves, has exhibited strain-dependent virulence. The mechanisms behind the variations in bivalve pathogenicity between V. mediterranei strains have remained unclear. However, a preliminary analysis of the extracellular product (ECP) proteomes has revealed differences in protein compositions between low- and high-virulence strains; in addition to 1265 shared proteins, 127 proteins have been identified to be specific to one low-virulence strain and 95 proteins to be specific to two high-virulence strains. We further studied the ECP proteins of the three V. mediterranei strains from functional perspectives using integrated genomics and proteomics approaches. The results showed that lipid metabolism, transporter activity and membrane transporter pathways were more enriched in the ECPs of the two high-virulence strains than in those of the low-virulence strain. Additionally, 73 of the 95 high-virulence strain-specific proteins were found to have coding genes in the genome but were not expressed in the low-virulence strain. Moreover, comparisons with known virulence factors in the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB) and the Pathogen-Host Interactions Database (PHI-base) allowed us to predict more than 10 virulence factors in the categories of antimicrobial activity/competitive advantage, the effector delivery system and immune modulation, and the high-virulence strain-specific ECP proteins consisted of a greater percentage of known virulence factors than the low-virulence strain. Particularly, two virulence factors, MtrC and KatG, were identified in the ECPs of the two high-virulence strains but not in those of the low-virulence strain. Most coding genes of the ECP proteins including known virulence factors were identified on chromosome 1 of V. mediterranei. Our findings indicate that variations in virulence factor composition in the bacterial ECPs may partially account for the differences in the bivalve pathogenicity between V. mediterranei strains.",10.3390/ani14050692

Preparation of high-quality protein samples remains the key in high-quality 2-DE for proteomic analysis. Samples with high endogenous levels of interfering molecules, such as salts, nucleic acids, lipids, and polysaccharides, would yield a low-quality 2-DE gel and hinder the analysis. Recently, a TRIzol-based protein extraction method has gained prominence and has attracted attention due to its promising performance in high-quality 2-DE. The authors evaluate the use of this approach for four valuable dried food products, namely two dried seafood products (abalone slices and whelk slices) and two traditional Chinese tonic foods (ganoderma and caterpillar fungus). The results indicate that 2-DE gels obtained through the TRIzol-based method are of high-quality and are comparable to those obtained through the trichloroacetic acid-acetone method in terms of spot number, spot intensity, and resolution. The TRIzol-based method is generally applicable to dried food samples and is simple and fast, which greatly streamlines the protein extraction procedure. Additionally, it enables the concurrent extraction and analysis of RNA, DNA, and protein from the same sample.",10.3390/ijms19071998

However its merits cannot be fully embodied by its current synthesis approaches, since most of them were normally tedious, costly, low yield or environment unfriendly, and poor in controlling multiple parameters of MnO2. Inspired by biopolymer-assisted synthesis of hierarchical inorganic materials in living systems, a marine biopolymer was used for structure-controllable synthesis of MnO2 in this study. Functioning as the reductant, surfactant and directing agent, alginate could tune the hierarchical architecture of MnO2 in multiple parameters including the dimension, nanometric size, crystallographic form and porosity, where delta-MnO2 nanocrystals with the size of 5 similar to 10 nm first assembled into nanosheets, and then flower-like structure with particle size tunable within 40 similar to 200 nm as well as micro-and mesopores. Due to these unique hierarchies in both the morphology and porosity, as-prepared MnO2 exhibited excellent performance as SC electrode, e.g. high power density (32.5 kW kg(-1)), high energy density (75.1 Wh kg(-1)) and great cycling stability. Given the green, low-temperature and scalable one-step process, this synthesis may pave a highly promising way to massive production of MnO2 electrode materials for SCs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Reliable culture techniques that provide high growth and survival rates for juvenile snails have been established; however, additional research is needed to improve breeding in captivity. The goals of this study were to efficiently relax the snails to identify the sex in order to conduct a study to understand the effect of different sex ratios on reproductive output. Of the seven chemical solutions used to relax the snails, benzocaine mixed in methanol was the most effective. To examine the effect of sex ratio, 10 snails were stocked into 75 L tanks within a recirculating aquaculture system at the ratios of 3 F:7 M, 5 F:5 M, 7 F:3 M, and 8 F:2 M for 8 weeks. There was a significant positive relationship between the number of egg clutches produced and a higher number of females in the tank. However, there were no significant differences in the number of eggs per clutch, egg diameter, percent hatch rates, female production (egg clutches per female per week), or the number of juvenile snails produced per female. The number of copulations was observed for the first three weeks of the experiment. When standardized to the number of copulations per male snails, no significant differences between treatments were detected. Our results suggest that a female-biased sex ratio may prove optimal and cost effective for large-scale captive breeding production. Future studies should determine the minimal proportion of males needed to limit the loss of genetic diversity in a female-biased stock enhancement program. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

Water-soluble proteins were extracted from nacre of the sea snail Haliotis laevigata by dissolving the mineral phase with 6% acetic acid. The influence of this protein mixture on CaCO3 precipitation rates was investigated at different concentrations. A well-established assay for measuring the pH-value during CaCO3 precipitation with and without protein additives was extended by calculating maximum precipitation rates from the pH-values. It could be shown that precipitation rates are greatly influenced by the mixtures of water-soluble nacre proteins. At very low protein concentrations (0.02 mu g/ml) a rate enhancement in comparison to the pure supersaturated calcium carbonate solution by a factor of 1.4 was observed. At higher protein concentrations, a strong inhibitory effect occurred, with total inhibition at concentrations of 1.0 mu g/ml and higher. Two unspecific proteins (bovine serum albumin and lysozyme) showed little or no modification of precipitation rates. In vivo, the function of the strong inhibition of CaCO3 precipitation by nacre proteins at higher concentrations is presumably to prevent uncontrolled crystallization in the extrapallial fluid. The rate-enhancing capability of proteins at low concentrations may be explained by the presence of acidic and/or hydrophilic moieties. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

There are, however, several constraints to consider throughout much of the Pacific, including, transport problems, fragile ecosystems, lack of suitable sites, limited economies, and the effects of customary marine tenure on access to growout sites. To overcome these problems, coastal aquaculture in the Pacific will need to focus either on species of high value, or those that yield non-perishable products. Valuable industries have been established for pearl oysters, penaeid shrimps, and the microalgae, Spirulina, in tropical Australia, the French territories and Hawaii, whereas enterprises for cultured giant clams, milkfish (Chanos chanos) as tuna bait, the macroalgae, Eucheuma, and sponges are emerging in the small island developing states.

We advocate an experimental approach to test the hypothesis that reseeded stocks will yield greater harvests than unseeded controls. We tested the effectiveness of releasing hatchery-reared juveniles to enhance stocks of the topshell Trochus niloticus in Australia, Indonesia and Vanuatu using a rigorous design enabling direct comparisons among countries. Trochus were released at different sizes (6-12, 16-27 nun) and densities (2-8 m(2)) at replicated sites in each region. Populations at those sites were subsequently compared with those at unseeded controls. Temporal variation in success was also assessed by repeating the experiment in Indonesia. Initial survival was monitored by tagging the juveniles with aluminium foil and recapturing them using underwater metal detectors. The majority of juveniles released in Australia and Indonesia died or disappeared within a month of release and stocks were not enhanced relative to controls. Predation, especially by fish, was considered likely to be the most important cause of loss, but further investigation is required. Losses in Vanuatu were also substantial, but up to 4.4% of 10-27 mm juveniles were recaptured alive after 12 months. Results froth Australia and Vanuatu suggested that survival may be improved by releasing juveniles in greater densities and at greater sizes.

The sediment accumulation rate in the abalone culture area and control area were 0.95 cm.a(-1) and 0.30 cm.a(-1), respectively. And the TOC and TN burial fluxes in the abalone culture area (35.41 +/- 0.25 g.m(-2).a(-1) and 4.58 +/- 1.70 g.m(-2).a(-1), respectively) were about 5 and 7 times higher than those in the control area (7.03 +/- 1.39 g.m(-2).a(-1) and 0.72 +/- 0.17 g.m(-2).a(-1), respectively), respectively. The source contributions and increasing trend of marine-sourced OC were significantly higher in the abalone culture area (range: 47-126%; average: 89 +/- 20%) than in the control area (range: 35-73%; average: 59 +/- 10%). In conclusion, our results indicated the burial process and sources of SOC in the mariculture areas and its adjacent areas were significantly enhanced by the mariculture activities and were influenced by the environmental changes.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.736421

Current understanding of virulence in V. harveyi is limited by strain-specific variability and complex host-pathogen dynamics. This study sought to integrate genomic investigation, phenotypic characterisation and in vivo challenge trials in barramundi (Lates calcarifer) to increase our understanding of V. harveyi virulence. We identified two hypervirulent isolates, Vh-14 and Vh-15 that caused 100% mortality in fish within 48 hours, and that were phenotypically and genotypically distinct from other V. harveyi isolates. Virulent isolates contained multiple plasmids, including a 105,412 bp conjugative plasmid with type III secretion system genes originally identified in Yersinia pestis. The emergence of this hypervirulent plasmid-mediated patho-variant poses a potential threat to the sustainable production of marine finfish in Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean and Australia. In addition, we observed an effect of temperature on phenotypic indicators of virulence with an increase in activity at 28 degrees C and 34 degrees C compared to 22 degrees C. This suggests that temperature fluctuations associated with climate change may act as a stressor on bacteria, increasing virulence gene secretion and host adaptation.

The technology for the cryopreservation of these objects includes the selection of freezing conditions and the use, in addition to traditional cryoprotectants, of combinations of exogenous lipids, antioxidants, and disaccharide trehalose as a membrane stabilizing agent. We propose an approach for the preservation of marine invertebrate cells. The approach is based on the use of biologically active substances obtained from the tissues of marine organisms. Our results demonstrated the synergistic activity of these components of cryoprotective mixtures, and, at the same time, the specificity of antioxidant effects. An analysis of the factors that determine the choice of cryoprotectors was performed for various cell types.

In this study, we investigated the responses of the larvae of the ascidian Herdmania curvata to haliclonacyclamine A (HA), the major component of a suite of cytotoxic alkaloids extracted from the sponge Haliclona sp. 628. Both Haliclona sp. 628 and Herdmania curvata inhabit the crest and slope of Heron Island Reef. High rates of settlement were induced in competent H. curvata larvae by a range of concentrations of HA, all lower than that naturally occurring in the sponge. HA did not induce precompetent larvae to settle. Although early metamorphosis of HA-induced larvae was normal, larvae exposed to all but the lowest concentration of HA were developmentally arrested after completion of tail resorption, at about 4 h after the initiation of metamorphosis. These postlarvae underwent extensive cellular necrosis within 24 h. We also demonstrate that the addition of a transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D, to larvae also causes inhibition of metamorphosis after tail resorption is completed. Analyses of incorporation of radiolabelled nucleotides to measure levels of transcription during normal development and after the addition of the transcriptional inhibitor indicate that there is a significant burst of transcriptional activity just after tail resorption is completed. Despite inhibiting metamorphosis at the same stage as actinomycin D, HA increases initial rates of RNA synthesis after induction of metamorphosis in a manner similar to that observed in normal postlarvae until the onset of cellular necrosis. We conclude that HA initially induces H. curvata larvae to settle and progress through early metamorphosis possibly by engaging the same pathway as other artificial and environmental cues but subsequently inhibits completion of metamorphosis, resulting in death of the postlarvae. Since HA does not affect overall transcription rates, it appears to disrupt another important developmental process during early metamorphosis.",10.1007/s002270100698
"Martone, RG; Bodini, A; Micheli, F",Identifying potential consequences of natural perturbations and management decisions on a coastal fishery social-ecological system using qualitative loop analysis,2017,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,22,1,,,34,"Managing for sustainable development and resource extraction requires an understanding of the feedbacks between ecosystems and humans. These feedbacks are part of complex social-ecological systems (SES), in which resources, actors, and governance systems interact to produce outcomes across these component parts. Qualitative modeling approaches offer ways to assess complex SES dynamics. Loop analysis in particular is useful for examining and identifying potential outcomes from external perturbations and management interventions in data poor systems when very little is known about functional relationships and parameter values. Using a case study of multispecies, multifleet coastal small-scale fisheries, we demonstrate the application of loop analysis to provide predictions regarding SES responses to perturbations and management actions. Specifically, we examine the potential ecological and socioeconomic consequences to coastal fisheries of different governance interventions (e.g., territorial user rights, fisheries closures, market-based incentives, ecotourism subsidies) and environmental changes. Our results indicate that complex feedbacks among biophysical and socioeconomic components can result in counterintuitive and unexpected outcomes. For example, creating new jobs through ecotourism or subsidies might have mixed effects on members of fishing cooperatives vs. nonmembers, highlighting equity issues. Market-based interventions, such as ecolabels, are expected to have overall positive economic effects, assuming a direct effect of ecolabels on marketprices, and a lack of negative biological impacts under most model structures. Our results highlight that integrating ecological and social variables in a unique unit of management can reveal important potential trade-offs between desirable ecological and social outcomes, highlight which user groups might be more vulnerable to external shocks, and identify which interventions should be further tested to identify potential win-win outcomes across the triple-bottom line of the sustainable development paradigm.",10.5751/ES-08825-220134

These are the first triploid sea urchins of any species that have been produced at any life stage and represent an initial step in a larger effort to yield triploid adult green sea urchins for large-scale land-based and near-shore commercial aquaculture ventures. Following fertilization, triploid mollusks and fish result by preventing release of the second polar body. Adult triploids in all of these organisms are sterile and may be larger than diploids based on accelerated growth of somatic tissues. Similar methods are impossible for sea urchins since haploid (1n) ova are released from the ovary after completion of both meiotic divisions. We have produced triploid green sea urchin embryos (3n = 63) by fusing two in ova (each n =21) and fertilizing the diploid products of these fusions with highly diluted spermatozoa (n = 21). Mechanical, proteolytic and acidic treatments were employed to remove the jelly coat and vitelline membrane prior to fusion. Results indicate that acidic removal of the extracellular structures, subsequent fusion with poly(Arg) in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and fertilization with highly diluted sperm yield 60.64 +/- 1.39% triploid embryos that reach prism pluteus stage (with spicules). Triploidy was verified at all developmental stages by counting chromosomes. We discuss scaling up our laboratory methods for embryos to the hatchery environment and also issues unique to the reproductive biology of sea urchins that will be vital for commercial aquaculture ventures to consider if triploid adult green sea urchins can ultimately be produced.

"Chapman, MG; Smoothey, AF",Sea urchins provide habitat for rare chitons in intertidal boulder-fields,2014,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,459,,31,37,,"Sea urchins provide habitat for many other invertebrates and fish which live in association with the spines or tests of the urchins. In boulder-fields in New South Wales, Australia, there is a large suite of chitons of the genus Ischnochiton, most of which show very overdispersed patterns of abundance among boulders, with many individuals aggregated onto few boulders. Most species are too sparse to manipulate experimentally to test hypotheses about their strong patterns of association with particular boulders, but the most common species, Ischnochiton australis, is strongly associated with the urchin, Heliocidaris erythrogramma, at two spatial scales. The two species occurred together on boulders more than expected by chance and, on boulders occupied by both species, abundances were positively correlated. In addition, I. australis were predominantly found under the spines and tests of the urchins. These patterns were general in time and space. Despite the relative rarity of the chiton, experiments were done to test hypotheses about the presence of each species influencing dispersal among boulders of the other species. Sample size was necessarily small because the chitons are not widespread among the boulders and not all experimental treatments and procedural controls could be included due to limited habitat containing chitons and urchins. Nevertheless, replicate small experiments showed that chitons decreased in abundance under boulders from which urchins had been removed, more than under boulders with chitons, although not all tests were significant. Urchins, in contrast, showed no effects of removal of chitons. Thus, it is likely that urchins provide habitat for chitons, rather than the reverse. Therefore, removal of urchins from these habitats by harvesting could have large negative effects on abundances of this relatively rare intertidal chiton, which appears to be a habitat-specialist. These experiments should offer insight into responses to habitat-needs for other rare molluscs and provide guidance on the value of experimental tests of habitat-specificity for rare species, even when rarity itself reduces the scope of the experimental treatments that can be used.

Changes to population demographics alter how effectively a species performs its ecological role. While a population may recover in density, this may not translate to recovery of ecological function. In 2013, a sea star wasting syndrome outbreak caused mass mortality of the keystone predator Pisaster ochraceus on the North American Pacific coast. We analyzed sea star counts, biomass, size distributions, and recruitment from long-term intertidal monitoring sites from San Diego to Alaska to assess regional trends in sea star recovery following the outbreak. Recruitment, an indicator of population recovery, has been spatially patchy and varied within and among regions of the coast. Despite sea star counts approaching predisease numbers, sea star biomass, a measure of predation potential on the mussel Mytilus californianus, has remained low. This indicates that post-outbreak populations have not regained their full predation pressure. The regional variability in percent of recovering sites suggested differences in factors promoting sea star recovery between regions but did not show consistent patterns in postoutbreak recruitment on a coast-wide scale. These results shape predictions of where changes in community composition are likely to occur in years following the disease outbreak and provide insight into how populations of keystone species resume their ecological roles following mortality-inducing disturbances.",10.1002/ece3.3953

The results of the study provided insights into the performance of quantum kernels when applied to both classical and quantum SVM models regarding classification and regression tasks. In classification tasks, the quantum kernels provided significant competitiveness in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 measure scores when compared to the classical kernels. Moreover, the quantum kernels have demonstrated promising outcomes in regression tasks, outperforming the classical kernels by achieving less mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and superior R-squared scores.",10.1007/s11128-025-04728-3

After the egg fertilized with genetically inactivated sperm, the fertilized eggs were treated with cytochalasin B (CB) at different concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 mg/L for 20 min. The ploidy of larvae under different induction concentrations were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the chromosome division process during sperm entry and cleavage was observed by fluorescence microscope. In addition, the ultrastructure of sperm, embryonic development, and chromosome were observed. The results showed that the fertilization rate and cleavage rate decreased gradually with the prolongation of UV irradiation time. We found UV irradiation for 9 s was the optimal time for haploid formation, with an induction rate of 100%. The CB treatment at 0.75 mg/L was the optimal concentration for the formation of D-larvae, and the induction rate was 9.60% +/- 5.10%. The results showed that the optimal conditions for inducing gynogenetic diploid of R. philippinarum were irradiation with UV intensity of 230 mu W (cm2s) for 9 s and inhibited second polar body release by CB at concentration of 0.75 mg/L.

"Jazwa, CS; Zoellner, A","Middle Holocene residential mobility in western Santa Rosa Island, California",2024,QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL,689,,16,29,,"The middle Holocene (8200-4200 cal BP) on California ' s northern Channel Islands (NCI) was a period of important population change, including the elaboration of settlement and subsistence systems during periods of environmental stress. On Santa Rosa Island (SRI), there is evidence for intensive settlement associated with greater sedentism along the relatively wet and productive northwest coast. We use faunal, chronological, and stable oxygen isotopic ( delta 18 O) data from middle Holocene interior residential base sites to reconstruct patterns of mobility between the coast and the interior of the island. Most of the interior sites on SRI dating to this period are oriented toward the northwest coast and previous isotopic studies have indicated they were used seasonally to access terrestrial plant resources and fresh water from fog. This is supported by the faunal record from CA -SRI50, which was occupied during the summer and fall and has a low -diversity faunal record associated with field processing prior to transporting marine foods to the site. CA -SRI -152 and -229, however, are two sites oriented toward the southwest coast, an area that is drier and less productive overall, but contained a high abundance of red abalone ( Haliotis rufescens ). These sites appear to have additional roles, including as stopover locations, reflected by a lower density but more diverse faunal record with settlement focused on the spring. This study indicates that the structure of interior residential bases on the NCI during the middle Holocene was not monolithic and that people traveled to the interior for different purposes. By understanding the diversity of sites in the context of environmental variability during the middle Holocene, we can better reconstruct patterns of seasonal mobility and site use during an important period of change that contributed to the eventual development of coastal hunter -gatherer -fisher social complexity.",10.1016/j.quaint.2023.10.011

The temperature of all cultivations averaged 12 degrees C. For greenhouse cultivation in 60-L aerated tanks (0.8 L air L-1 culture min(-1)), as the panel spacing decreased from 12 to 6 cm, biomass productivity per panel on the 30 x 30 cm panels decreased from to 165 to 112 g FW (fresh weight) m(-2) panel day(-1), due to reduced growth associated with light attenuation by fronds crowding into the space between panels. However, areal productivity was maintained at 17-18 g AFDW (ash-free dry weight) m(-2) day(-1), because twice as many panels were present in the same liquid surface area. Areal productivity for tumble culture was statistically higher at 21 g AFDW m(-2) day(-1).

The mantle, the arm and the two parts of the suckers: the infundibulum and the acetabulum were analysed independently. With the exception of the suckers, the general morphology of the epidermis does not vary from the first days post-hatching to adulthood. In general terms, histochemical techniques do not indicate changes in the composition of glycoconjugates of the epidermis main cells, epithelial and secretory cells. The epithelial cells of the mantle and arm show positivity for mannose (ConA+) in their apical portions, indicating the presence of n-glycoproteins that, among other things, provide lubrication to the surface of the body. In the suckers, the apical surface of the infundibulum contains sulphated glycosaminoglycans of the N-acetylglucosamine type that provide adhesive properties. In addition to observing three types of mucocytes, m1 and m2 are characteristic of the mantle and arm, and m3 is found in the suckers. The paralarva epidermis is characterised by the presence of Kolliker's organs whose exact function is unknown. In this study, the absence of staining with alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff(AB/PAS) prevents the possibility of attributing a secretory function.

Like many other oyster species, diploid C. hongkongensis undergo slow growth and high mortality during gametogenesis. Promoting the commercial culturing of triploids may be one way to solve these problems. We present the first study of the effects of ploidy, site and their interaction on the grow-out traits of C. hongkongensis reaching market size. According to our results, triploid larvae grew significantly faster (P < 0.05) than diploids, but there was no significant difference in survival rate between diploid and triploid larvae. Within each site, triploids often had higher shell height than diploids (P < 0.05), and there were significant differences (P < 0.001) in shell height among sites. Additionally, there were significant differences (P < 0.001) in whole weight based on both site and ploidy, but no significant interactions between site and ploidy were observed. The incremental survival rates of triploids were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those of diploids in December 2015, April 2016, August 2016 and April 2017, likely because triploids appeared less sensitive to environmental variations and displayed an obviously lower degree of gonad development than diploids. Moreover, there were significant differences (P < 0.05) in incremental survival rate among sites, suggesting that variations in environmental conditions may have great impacts on the survival rate of C. hongkongensis. In the reproductive phase, the relative expressions of the genes belonging to the insulin-like pathway were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in diploid C. hongkongensis, which is likely related to the high-energy consumption of gametogenesis in diploids. In the non-reproductive phase, the significantly higher (P < 0.05) expressions of insulin-like pathway genes in triploid C. hongkongensis matched their significantly faster growth, which may provide a new explanation for this fast growth of triploids. In conclusion, this study confirms the clear advantage of triploid C. hongkongensis over diploids in terms of growth, whole weight and survival rate, and supports the commercial promotion of triploid C. hongkongensis.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.04.017

To provide additional insights, we have created a proportionally defined combinatorial model consisting of two nacre-associated proteins, C-RING AP7 (shell nacre, Haliotis rufescens) and pseudo-EF hand PFMG1 (oyster pearl nacre, Pinctada fucata), whose individual in vitro mineralization functionalities are well-documented and distinct from one another.

Further, these two proteins jointly create nanoscale protein aggregates or phases that under mineralization conditions further assemble into protein-mineral polymer-induced liquid precursor-like phases with enhanced ACC stabilization capabilities, and there is evidence of intermolecular interactions between AP7 and PFMG1 under these conditions.

However, current liquid formulations have short shelf life and high risk of bacterial contamination. The aim of our study was to develop a stable functional formulation. Analytical techniques (nano-differential scanning calorimetry and spectroscopy) and biological assays (cytotoxicity and plaque reduction) were employed to measure the effect of sugar addition on the physical properties and shelf life of the solid formulated hemocyanin. Sucrose improved thermal stability significantly by both increasing the aggregation onset temperature (70 degrees C to >78 degrees C) and enhancing the activation energy (18%). Lyophilisation without trehalose caused degradation and unfolding of the alpha-helices of hemocyanin. However, the addition of an optimal proportion of trehalose:protein (5:1 by weight) prevented the degradation and unfolding during lyophilisation, hence maintained the protein solubility. The estimated ED50 values of the formulated solid (0.43 +/- 0.1) and liquid samples (0.37 +/- 0.06) were similar in magnitude, and were significantly lower than the respective controls; thus, confirming enhanced antiviral activity of the formulation. Formulated compounds were stable for six months at 5 degrees C storage. The enhanced shelf life and stable antiviral activity of the formulation offers its significant potential as effective therapeutic agent in future clinical applications.

Given the unique features of the COE gene, its proposed ancestral role in the specification of chemosensory neurons and the wealth of functional data from vertebrates and Drosophila, the evolutionary history of the COE gene can be readily investigated. We have examined the ways in which COE expression has diversified among the Metazoa by analysing its expression from representatives of four disparate invertebrate phyla: Ctenophora (Mnemiopsis leidyi); Mollusca (Haliotis asinina); Annelida (Capitella teleta and Chaetopterus) and Echinodermata (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus). In addition, we have studied COE function with knockdown experiments in S. purpuratus, which indicate that COE is likely to be involved in repressing serotonergic cell fate in the apical ganglion of dipleurula larvae. These analyses suggest that COE has played an important role in the evolution of ectodermally derived tissues (likely primarily nervous tissues) and mesodermally derived tissues. Our results provide a broad evolutionary foundation from which further studies aimed at the functional characterisation and evolution of COE can be investigated.",10.1007/s00427-010-0343-3

In the Abrolhos Archipelago, the vermetid Dendropoma irregulare (d'Orbigny, 1842) associated with the CCA Porolithon pachydermum (Foslie) Foslie, represents a significant portion of the reef edges. This study aimed to analyze the seasonal influence of the substrate and hydrodynamic exposure to vermetid D. irregulare settlement, and to verify if the biological cues might be acting in the vermetid settlement. Seasonal in situ settlement experiments were performed, testing different substrata (live coralline algae, dead coralline algae, and artificial substrate) in three study sites (Mato Verde, Caldeiros, and Siriba) and a seasonal exposure index was calculated. We found that P. pachydermum enhance settlement of D. irregulare in the Abrolhos reefs. The vermetid settlements were significantly higher on (1) substrates with live CCA, and (2) in the presence of substrates with live CCA cues. The highest vermetid settlements, which best reveal the positive effect of substrate cues (live coralline algae), were observed at Siriba during summer and autumn-winter, being more than twice that recorded in Mato Verde. It is suggested that features associated with live coralline surfaces may attract the settlement of the juvenile vermetid. This study revealed a significant positive correlation between settlements of the vermetid on live CCA and the degree of exposure to hydrodynamics, where the highest densities were observed in a moderate condition of exposure. Responses to the preferential settlement on live coralline algae surfaces in the present study are probably due to a complex of cues acting simultaneously, which includes the physical (hydrodynamics) and biological cues (biofilms). This study provides the first attempt to examination of the settlement factors of the vermetids, contributing to the role that live coralline may play as nursery habitats in the Abrolhos Archipelago. Because of its ability to induce settlement of the crawling juvenile vermetid, CCA play a fundamental role in the life cycle of many marine invertebrates, including D. irregulare.

The side effect of association rules hiding technique is to hide certain rules that are not sensitive, failing to hide certain sensitive rules and generating false rules in the resulted database. This affects the privacy of the data and the utility of data mining results. In this paper, a method called Gene Patterned Association Rule Hiding (GPARH) is proposed for preserving privacy of the data and maintaining the data utility, based on data perturbation technique. Using gene selection operation, privacy linked hidden and exposed data items are mapped to the vector data items, thereby obtaining gene based data item. The performance of proposed GPARH is evaluated in terms of metrics such as number of sensitive rules generated, true positive privacy rate and execution time for selecting the sensitive rules by using Abalone and Taxi Service Trajectory datasets.",10.1515/cait-2017-0032

In this study, disease surveillance and histopathological characterization were used to compare disease dynamics and conditions in both restored and extant wild populations. Disease had devastating effects on both wild and restored populations, but dynamics were highly variable and appeared to be site-specific with no significant differences in disease prevalence between wild versus restored sites. A subset of 20 haphazardly selected colonies at each site observed over a four-month period revealed widely varying disease incidence, although not between restored and wild sites, and a case fatality rate of 8%. A tropical storm was the only discernable environmental trigger associated with a consistent spike in incidence across all sites. Lastly, two field mitigation techniques, (1) excision of apparently healthy branch tips froma diseased colony, and (2) placement of a band of epoxy fully enclosing the diseased margin, gave equivocal results with no significant benefit detected for either treatment compared to controls. Tissue condition of associated samples was fair to very poor; unsuccessful mitigation treatment samples had severe degeneration of mesenterial filament cnidoglandular bands. Polyp mucocytes in all samples were infected with suspect rickettsia-like organisms; however, no bacterial aggregates were found. No histological differences were found between disease lesions with gross signs fitting literature descriptions of white-band disease (WBD) and rapid tissue loss (RTL).

We show that primary embryonic and established fibroblasts can be induced by interferons or by intracellular bacterial infection to express a perforin-like mRNA previously described as macrophage-expressed gene 1 (Mpeg1). The presence and level of the perforin-like mRNA correlate with the ability of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) to eliminate intracellular bacteria. In addition, siRNA knockdown of the perforin-like molecule abolishes bactericidal activity and allows intracellular bacterial replication. Complementation of MEF in which the endogenous perforin-like molecule has been knocked down with a red fluorescent protein-tagged version restores bactericidal activity. The perforin-like molecule has broad bactericidal specificity for pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, including Gram-positive and -negative, and acid fast bacteria. The perforin-like molecule renders previously lysozyme-resistant bacteria sensitive to lysis by lysozyme suggesting physical damage of the outer cell wall by the perforin-like protein.

BRD has been diagnosed in Ireland on only one occasion (1997) although the aetiological agent has recently been detected in apparently healthy Manila clams from a number of sites around the Irish coast. The present work investigated the susceptibilities to BRD of two stocks of Manila clams, one from Ireland and the second from Galicia, north-western Spain, where BRD has been reported on a number of occasions. Exposure of the clams was by addition of V. tapetis to the holding waters. Development of BRD was assessed by the appearance of brown ring signs on the host shells, by bacterial isolation and characterization, and by detection of the bacterium by PCR. The pathogen was recovered from infected individuals and confirmed as V. tapetis by biochemical tests and a slide agglutination test. Galician clams experienced significantly higher mortalities, BRD prevalences and V. tapetis levels than Irish clams. Background infection with V. tapelis in the control stocks prevented conclusions being drawn on comparative susceptibility of the two stocks. Irish clams were significantly affected by the experimental challenge, as demonstrated by the development of BRD and an increase in V. tapetis levels. Results illustrate the vulnerability of Irish clams to BRD and have implications for the movement and transfer of clam seed in Ireland. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Now, working with a retained column sample that yielded more than 12,600 vertebrate specimens weighing more than 2,435g and more than 4,220g of shellfish remains, we present a comprehensive archaeofaunal analysis that reveals a cyclic progression of three distinct Late Holocene occupational phases supported by use of diverse fish species and a single shellfish taxon, Megastraea (formerly Lithopoma) undosa (wavy top turban snail). Each occupational phase repeats a pattern of escalating use of fish and the wavy top snail over time, followed by abrupt declines in the use of these resources, signaling the onset of short-term inter-occupational hiatuses. Why each occupational phase declined is not known, nor can the nature of the inter-occupational hiatuses be discerned. However, while the overall pattern of subsistence procurement is the same in each phase, proportional use of the principal resources varies between the occupations, indicating changes over time in resource availability. A variety of warm-water fish species in the archaeofauna suggests that the cyclic occupations might reflect seasonal use of the site or that the hiatuses could have been responses to broader climatic episodes, such as droughts or El Ninos that would have had negative effects on the availability of environmentally sensitive taxa. Over-exploitation of the intensively exploited gastropod may also have been a contributing factor in periodic site abandonment.",10.1080/1947461X.2017.1292438

However, it was not until the late 1940s that cultivation of seaweeds in near-shore coastal areas began. Due to their location, the Korean peninsula, the Japanese islands and the Chinese coasts share a similar seaweed flora in their coastal waters, and it is not surprising that seaweed species chosen for cultivation, methods of farming and post-harvest processing in these countries have a lot in common. In 2016, the total seaweed production in these three countries reached 16,218,406 t, approximately 53.8% of global seaweed production (FAO).

In this article, the recent development of cultivar-related research and applications practised in Korea, Japan and China are reviewed with particular reference to the key commercial species: Saccharina japonica, Pyropia spp., Undaria spp., Cladosiphon okamurarus, and Nemacystus decipiens. In the past 21 years, 47 certified seaweed cultivars have been used in commercial cultivation in these countries.

Contrasting patterns of native and introduced ascidians in subantarctic and temperate Chile,2016,MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,7,1,77,86,,"We analysed the biodiversity of ascidians in two areas located in southern and northern Chile: Punta Arenas in the Strait of Magellan (53 degrees latitude, subantarctic) and Coquimbo (29 degrees latitude, temperate). The oceanographic features of the two zones are markedly different, with influence of the Humboldt Current in the north, and the Cape Horn Current System, together with freshwater influxes, in the Magellanic zone. Both regions were surveyed twice during 2013 by SCUBA diving and pulling ropes and aquaculture cages. Both artificial structures and natural communities were sampled. A total of 22 species were identified, three of them reported for the first time in Chilean waters: Lissoclinum perforatum, Synoicum georgianum, and Polyzoa minor. The first is an introduced species found here for the first time in the Pacific. No species occurred in both regions, highlighting the very different environmental conditions of subantarctic vs. temperate waters. In spite of exhaustive searches in aquaculture facilities and on artificial structures such as harbour docks and piers, no introduced species were found in the Punta Arenas area. Conversely, 5 out of 11 (45%) species found in northern Chile were introduced. The Coquimbo area has a history of ship traffic dating back at least 150 years, and cultures of native (e.g. scallop) as well as exotic species (e.g. abalone) have been deployed for ca. 35 years. Some of the introduced species, such as Ciona robusta (formerly C. intestinalis sp. A), constitute pests for scallop culture facilities in the area, causing serious losses to local farmers. It is surprising that the Punta Arenas zone, with a history of ship traffic dating back ca. 500 years and over 25 years of sustained mussel and salmon aquaculture activity, is apparently free from introduced species. The ascidian cover on artificial structures is high, but it is made up of native species such as Paramolgula sp., Cnemidocarpa verrucosa, or Polyzoa opuntia. It is hypothesized that cold waters (5 to 11 degrees C) are the determining factor hindering the development of introduced ascidians, which tend to be temperate-warm water species. The ongoing warming in the Southern Cone may change this picture and continued monitoring is strongly advised.",10.3391/mbi.2016.7.1.10

In this paper, the novel outlier detection approach Adaptive Mine Blast Optimization (AMBO) GAN is proposed for differentiating the fake data from the original one. GAN improves the data quality and efficiency by correcting errors and reducing the noise. GAN involves iterative backup loop between generator and descriminator. The network loss of GAN is minimized with AMBO algorithm which outperforms other metaheuristic approaches in terms of convergence and solution. In AMBO, the function values are minimized to near optimal solution during early iterations.

PAH has been confirmed to have antibacterial and antifungal properties, but its antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities against Vibrio parahaemolyticus (V. parahaemolyticus) have not been reported. This work aimed to explore the antibacterial and antibiofilm efficacy of PAH against V. parahaemolyticus and its potential application in seafood. PAH showed moderate inhibitory effect against V. parahaemolyticus with minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) ranging from 20 to 40 mM. PAH destroyed cell membrane integrity and structure, as evidenced by the leakage of intracellular components and decreased cell viability. Meanwhile, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) indicated the involvement of oxidative stress in bactericidal mechanisms. PAH at subinhibitory concentrations (SICs) effectively reduced biofilm biomass as measured by crystal violet staining and plate colony counts assay. Furthermore, biofilm inhibitory effect of PAH on V. parahaemolyticus was also manifested by loose structure, decreased extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) contents of biofilm cells and less viable cells inside the biofilm. RT-qPCR showed that the expression of genes involved in biofilm was suppressed by PAH. Lastly, PAH (MIC and 2MIC) significantly decreased the level of V. parahaemolyticus in spiked abalone and shrimp samples without affecting sensory acceptability.

This study investigates the feasibility of green technology utilising food waste as a renewable substrate for lactic acid and the resulting residue for subsequent carbon dot production through microbial fermentation and hydrothermal reaction, respectively, while evaluating seashell waste as a replacement for commercial neutralisation reagents. The results demonstrated that seashell waste exhibited effective neutralisation performance during lactic acid fermentation. Within the five types of seashell waste studied, apart from abalone seashells, which led to a significant decrease in lactic acid productivity, all resulted in similar lactic acid fermentations. Additionally, fine powders of seashells were found to be optimal when combined with food waste hydrolysate for lactic acid fermentation. The highest lactic acid productivity of 1.48 g L-1 h-1 obtained in 2 L bioreactor batch fermentation using fine shell powder was 1.64-fold and 0.41-fold higher than those obtained using shell pieces and shell powder, respectively. The results of cell immobilisation fermentation exhibited a superior performance with 2.90 g L-1 h-1 glucose consumption rate and 1.89 g L-1 h-1 lactic acid productivity, which were 1.23-fold and 0.97-fold higher compared to those obtained using NaOH as the neutraliser, respectively. The results of life-cycle assessment also revealed lower environmental impacts associated with lactic acid production using food waste and seashell waste.

Because seafood is a common source of arsenic exposure and some arsenolipids are toxic, studying the abundance and species of arsenolipids in seafood is crucial for health risk assessment. Current arsenolipid research is confined by analytical techniques and limited to raw seafood analysis, despite the fact that most seafood is ingested cooked. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate which seafood contributes to arsenolipid dietary intake and investigate the changes in arsenolipids before and after cooking. In Chongqing, China, popular seafood such as clam, shrimp, oyster, abalone, hairtail, and yellow croaker were collected. The raw and cooked samples prepared from these seafood products were examined using a non-targeted screening approach established for arsenolipids, which coupled high-performance liquid chromatography with data-independent high-resolution quadrupole-time-of-flight electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Arsenic-containing hydrocarbons (AsHC330, AsHC332, and AsHC360), arsenic-containing fatty acids (AsFA362, AsFA390, AsFA404, AsFA418, and AsFA422), trimethylarsine oxide, and thiolated trimethylarsinic acid were detected. The species of arsenolipids in each type of seafood remained intact after heating in the microwave oven. In cooked samples, the concentrations of AsFA362 and AsFA390 were significantly lower than in raw samples, whereas the concentrations of other arsenolipids were unchanged. Microwave cooking did not result in the thiolation of the detected arsenolipids. The most detected species in raw and cooked samples were AsFA362, AsFA390, and AsFA418. Most arsenolipid species were found in the highest levels in hairtails and yellow croakers. It is the first time that arsenolipids have been found in the oyster, abalone, abalone liver, and yellow croaker.

Multiple Pseudo-nitzschia spp. have been identified in the northern Benguela with the potentially toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia pungens and P. australis dominant inshore. The yessotoxin (YTX) producing dinoflagellates Gonyaulax spinifera, Lingulodinium polyedrum and Protoceratium reticulatum are all known to form blooms and YTXs have been the cause of massive mortalities of farmed abalone. Prominent fish-killing blooms include Karlodinium veneficum in the northern Benguela and Karenia cristata in the southern Benguela. Shellfish farms in an embayment of the southern Benguela have suffered reduced growth rates due to the ecosystem disruptive blooms of Aureococcus anophagefferens. High biomass dinoflagellate blooms often attributed to Tripos and Prorocentrum spp. characterise the entire region and major mortalities of marine life are regularly attributed to their decay and the subsequent development of anoxic conditions.",10.1016/j.hal.2020.101898

Studies reveal that the complications associated with diabetes can be reduced by proper management of the disease by continuously monitoring and forecasting the blood glucose level of patients. Objective. The prior prediction of blood glucose level is necessary to overcome the lag time for insulin absorption in diabetic type 1 patients. Method. In this research, we use continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data to predict future blood glucose level using the previous data points. We compare two neural network techniques. We apply the optimal feedforward neural network and then propose optimal nonlinear autoregressive neural networks for blood glucose prediction 15-30 minutes earlier for diabetic type 1 patients. We validate the proposed model with 2 virtual subjects using their 24-hour blood glucose level data. These two case studies have been compiled from AIDA, i.e., the freeware mathematical diabetes simulator. Results. In the prediction horizon (PH) of 15 and 30 minutes, improved results have been shown for minimal inputs for blood glucose level of a particular subject. Root mean square error (RMSE) is used for performance calculation. For the optimal feedforward neural network, the RMSE is 0.9984 and 3.78 ml/dl, and for the optimal nonlinear autoregressive neural network, it reduces the RMSE to 0.60 and 1.12 ml/dl for 15 min and 30 min prediction horizons, respectively, for subject 1. Similarly, for subject 2 for the optimal feedforward neural network, RMSE is 1.43 and 3.51 ml/dl which is improved using the optimal autoregressive neural network to 0.7911 and 1.6756 ml/dl for 15 min and 30 min prediction horizons, respectively. Validation. We further validate our proposed model using UCI machine learning datasets (Abalone and Servo), and it shows improved results on that as well. Conclusion and Future Work. The proposed optimal nonlinear autoregressive neural network model performs better than the feedforward neural network model for these time series data. In the future, we intend to investigate a greater collection of AIDA scenarios and data that are real and influence other factors of BGLs.",10.1155/2021/6611091

The concentration of HCB porogen varied among 10, 20, 30, and 40 wt%. The Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis revealed that the Ca/P molar ratio of CHA was 1.73, which was close to natural bone's Ca/P molar ratio of 1.71. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD) tests revealed that the formed phase of the synthesized CHA was of the B-type. Analysis of the pores structure showed an increasing porogen concentration, pores size, and porosity of the scaffold. The addition of HCB porogen also decreased the crystallite size. This was very good for bone growth because the low crystallinity created dislocations, making it easier for cells to proliferate. Based on the results of cell viability assay on scaffold CHA + HCB 40 wt%, the growth of MC3T3E1 cells was inhibited beginning at a scaffold concentration of 500 mu g/mL because the percentage of viability decreased to similar to 115 % and the IC50 value of MC3T3E1 cells on the scaffold to 691830.97 mu g/mL. Based on to the one-way ANOVA, those result reflected no statistically significant differences in the average of cell viability value in the five groups (p > 0.05). The cell metabolic activity and morphology of the CHA + HCB 40 wt% scaffold enable it to facilitate the attachment of MC3T3E1 cells on its surface. Thus, HCB 40 wt% was the best concentration to fabricate the scaffold based on the criteria for pores structure, crystallographic properties, chemical decomposition process and cell viability for biomedical applications.",10.1016/j.mtcomm.2021.102135

In this study, the effect of sulfated polysaccharides from pacific abalone (AGSP) on the human gut microbiota was analyzed via an in vitro fermentation model. The results revealed that AGSP altered the overall structure of the gut microbiota and increased relative abundances of some Bacteroidales members, implying that intestinal Bacteroidales can play important roles in the bioactivities of AGSP. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, some species from the Bacteroides and Parabacteroides within Bacteroidales were isolated, and their characteristics on AGSP utilization were analyzed. It showed that AGSP utilization by intestinal Bacteroidales was species-dependent, and some species that liberated AGSP breakdown products promoted the growth of others unable to live in AGSP, forming an AGSP utilization network. The in vitro cell model showed that AGSP oligosaccharides had better anti-inflammatory activity and weaker cytotoxicity, implying that microbial degradation of AGSP can influence its reaction with host cells. These results indicated that the interaction between polysaccharides and gut microbes can together determine the beneficial effects of polysaccharides on the host health. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Notwithstanding the upturn, their conventional synthesis at extremely high temperatures yielding limiting compositions stands in the way of achieving a paradigm shift in gCN fabrication. With the ultimate goal of surpassing these hurdles, we utilize N-doped carbon nanosheets (N-CNS) as a filler in free-radical-mediated aqueous copolymerization. By dispersing N-CNS in a polymer matrix, high-performance mechanically robust composites could be developed and tailored to individual applications. As-synthesized hydrogel nanocomposite systems are used to decode the balance for emulating evolutionary accomplishments of nature's nanocomposites like the abalone's nacre. At a lower concentration (0.05%), N-CNS disperse homogeneously and interact intimately with the polymer matrix forming an interphase zone around individual nanofillers dramatically affecting the mobility of polymer chains to yield sheet architectures. On increasing the filler concentration (0.3%), the intercalation phenomenon gets perturbed due to an intrinsically oriented aggregation of nanofiller giving rise to a surge in entropy that leads to conspicuous buckling and tubular aggregates. At the interfacial regime, the poly(acrylic acid) domains come in closer proximity to the hydrophobic cages of N-CNS, and a nanoconfinement effect exerts high pressure manifesting acid-catalyzed condensation of melamine units to form, for the first time, quasi-two-dimensional heptazine-gCN (h-gCN) within hydrogel nanocomposites. Polymer properties are enhanced by the addition of N-CNS through complex interfacial interactions and the unique distributions of internanofiller distances. Endowed with mechanical properties that closely mimic natural skin and combined with the repurposed drug Iosartan, these hydrogel nanocomposites offer scarless healing of second-degree burns.",10.1021/acsapm.0c01020

Albeit comprising only brittle constituents, extrinsic reinforcement mechanisms impart to these nacre-like ceramics high toughness and non-catastrophic crack propagation properties. While several models have been developed to understand the mechanical properties of natural and synthetic brick-and-mortar materials, they have always considered a ductile interface and focused mostly on intrinsic toughening mechanisms. Modeling so far has not captured the extrinsic toughening mechanisms responsible for the properties of nacre-like ceramics. Here we show that the Discrete Element Method (DEM) can account for reinforcement mechanisms such as microcracking and crack deflection, and quantitatively assess strength, initiation toughness and crack growth toughness. Two approaches are studied to enhance strength and toughness of nacre-like ceramics, either by reinforcing the interface globally (an increase of the interface strength) or locally (addition of nano-bridges). We combine the results to provide design guidelines for synthetic brick-and-mortar composites comprising only brittle constituents.",10.1016/j.compositesb.2019.107699

In this study, we investigated the inheritance of the orange shell color trait crossing the orange variant with two other color variants (white and black). The shell color morph was determined for each in 27 first- and 12 s-generation crosses as well as 13 test crosses. We found that the orange shell color is recessive trait compared to black and white, and is determined by two independent recessive genes. In addition, our data revealed that the genetic loci controlling orange shell have no effects on the formation of black foreground pigment.

This is certainly true for the mollusk shell, where glycosylated intracrystalline proteins such as AP24 (Haliotis rufescens) exist but their functions and the role of glycosylation remain elusive. To assess the effect of glycosylation on protein function, we expressed two recombinant variants of AP24: an unglycosylated bacteria expressed version (rAP24N) and a glycosylated insect cell-expressed version (rAP24G). Our findings indicate that rAP24G is expressed as a single polypeptide containing variations in glycosylation that create microheterogeneity in rAP24G molecular masses. These post-translational modifications incorporate O- and N-glycans and anionic monosialylated and bisialylated, and monosulfated and bisulfated monosaccharides on the protein molecules. AFM and DLS experiments confirm that both rAP24N and rAP24G aggregate to form protein phases, with rAP24N exhibiting a higher degree of aggregation, compared to rAP24G. With regard to functionality, we observe that both recombinant proteins exhibit similar behavior within in vitro calcium carbonate mineralization assays and potentiometric titrations. However, rAP24G modifies crystal growth directions and is a stronger nucleation inhibitor, whereas rAP24N exhibits higher mineral phase stabilization and nanoparticle containment. We believe that the post-translational addition of anionic groups (via sialylation and sulfation), along with modifications to the protein surface topology, may explain the changes in glycosylated rAP24G aggregation and mineralization behavior, relative to rAP24N.",10.1021/acs.biochem.5b01186

A shell color segregation study with progenies from a full factorial cross generated among Pacific oysters exhibiting distinct shell colors (golden, white and black) was conducted to investigate the inheritance of the golden shell color and its correlation with dark pigmentation. Random samples from twenty-three full-sib families were obtained and the shell coloration of offspring within each family was recorded. Results revealed that golden coloration was inherited in a different pattern from dark pigmentation, indicating its different genetic basis. Dark pigmentation was identified as a foreground color while golden or white color were background ones. The locus controlling background colors has two alleles with the allele for golden background being dominant to the allele for white background. In addition, the overlying foreground pigmentation of shells with a golden background was significantly lighter than that of shells with a white background, which suggested an epistatic effect of background color on shell foreground pigmentation.

LbAly35 showed practically no similarity to other molluscan alginate lyases in the N-terminal amino-acid sequence of 20 residues and no cross-reactivity with anti-abalone alginate lyase antiserum. These led us to consider that the primary structure of LbAly35 is considerably deviated from other molluscan enzymes. Thus, in the present study, we first compared the thermal stability of LbAly35 with an abalone alginate lyase, HdAly, and found that the first order inactivation rate constants for LbAly35 at 40 and 45 A degrees C were 1/20 and 1/45 of those for HdAly, respectively. Then, we cloned cDNAs encoding LbAly35 and characterized its deduced amino-acid sequence comparing with those of other molluscan alginate lyases. The cDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 5'- and 3'-RACE PCRs from the L. brevicula hepatopancreas cDNA using degenerated primers synthesized on the basis of partial amino-acid sequences of LbAly35. The cDNA covering the entire translational region of LbAly35 comprised 1,093 bp and encoded an amino-acid sequence of 296 residues. The amino-acid sequence consisted of an initiation methionine, a putative signal peptide for secretion (22 residues), a propeptide-like region (10 residues), and a mature LbAly35 domain of 263 residues. Although the N-terminal region of LbAly35 was significantly deviated from those of other molluscan alginate lyases, the catalytic domain of LbAly35 showed similar to 45 % identity to other molluscan enzymes which had been classified under polysaccharide-lyase-family-14 (PL-14). In addition, the amino-acid residues crucially important for the catalytic actions of PL-14 enzymes were also conserved in LbAly35. Accordingly, LbAly35 was regarded as a member of PL-14 as other molluscan alginate lyases despite the significant deviation of its N-terminal region.",10.1007/s12562-012-0517-1

Research has shown that their emergent mechanical properties are owed in part to their specific self-organization in hierarchical molecular structures, from nanoscale to macroscale, as well as their mixing and bonding. To apply these findings to manmade materials, researchers have devoted significant efforts in developing a fundamental understanding of multiscale mechanics of materials and its application to the design of novel materials with superior mechanical performance. These efforts included the utilization of some of the most promising carbon-based nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, and graphene, together with a variety of matrix materials. At the core of these efforts lies the need to characterize material mechanical behavior across multiple length scales starting from nanoscale characterization of constituents and their interactions to emerging micro- and macroscale properties. In this report, progress made in experimental tools and methods currently used for material characterization across multiple length scales is reviewed, as well as a discussion of how they have impacted our current understanding of the mechanics of hierarchical carbon-based materials. In addition, insight is provided into strategies for bridging experiments across length scales, which are essential in establishing a multiscale characterization approach. While the focus of this progress report is in experimental methods, their concerted use with theoretical-computational approaches towards the establishment of a robust material by design methodology is also discussed, which can pave the way for the development of novel materials possessing unprecedented mechanical properties.",10.1002/adma.201104850

In addition, they are present in numerous invertebrates, from cnidarians to urochordates. Many of those from non-mammalian groups are poorly understood with respect to function or phylogeny. Those well characterized so far are waprins from snakes, perlwapins from bivalves and crustins from decapod crustaceans. Waprins are venom proteins with a single WAP domain at the C-terminus. They display antimicrobial, rather than proteinase inhibitory, activities. Perlwapins, in contrast, possess three WAP domains at the C-terminus and are expressed in the shell nacre of abalones. They participate in shell formation by inhibiting the growth of calcium crystals in the shell. The crustin group is the largest of all WFDC-containing proteins in invertebrates with the vast majority being highly expressed in the haemocytes. Most have a single WAP domain at the C-terminus. The presence and type of the domains between the signal sequence and the C-terminus WAP domain separate the different crustin types. Most of the Type I and II crustins are antimicrobial towards Gram-positive bacteria, whereas the Type III crustins tend to display protease inhibition. Expression studies show that at least some crustins have other important biological effects, as levels change with physiological stress, wound repair, tissue regeneration or ecdysis. Thus WAP domains are widely distributed and highly conserved, serving in diverse physiological processes (proteinase inhibition, bacterial killing or inhibition of calcium transport).",10.1042/BST0391403

We investigate here the possibility of a probiotic biocontrol strategy to eradicate a well established, often pathogenic, non-chelating population by supplementing the system with generally regarded as safe siderophore producing bacteria.

We report here novel findings which implicate AP7 as a member of the intrinsically disordered protein class (IDP) and reveal new aspects of AP7 mineralization activity. AP7 is partially disordered but can undergo additional folding in the presence of TFE. AP7 binds Zn(II) ions in a non-tetracoordinate complex but does not require Zn(II) either for folding or for in vitro function. In addition to limiting calcite crystal growth, AP7 is also observed to induce aggregate formation within in vitro mineralization assays, and these aggregates are either amorphous (type A) or crystalline (type B) in appearance. The type A aggregate displays an irregular morphology and round, dark, electron dense deposits that do not give rise to a diffraction pattern. In contrast, the type B aggregates possess either organized parallel crystal clusters or highly dense hexagonal clusters that are confirmed by electron diffraction to be aragonite. This stabilization of aragonite is remarkable in that it occurred in the presence of AP7 alone and did not require typical aragonite stabilization agents such as Mg(II), other nacre proteins, or an organized organic matrix. The ability of a partially disordered C-RING protein to perform inorganic phase stabilization represents a new twist on both the RING domain and IDP stories, and this process of aggregate formation may provide an important clue with regard to the protein-mediated nacre formation process.",10.1021/bi802148r

The representative eight species, chum salmon, scallop, red sea bream, flounder, kuruma prawn, swimming crab, abalone and sea urchin, are investigated. It has been proven for chum salmon, scallop and red sea bream that stock enhancement contributes to the augmentation of net fishery production with economic feasibility. However, marked variations between prefectures in the scale of release were observed, and large variations in their stocking effectiveness were suggested in the six of the eight species (apart from chum salmon and scallop). There are two basic measures for evaluating stocking effectiveness. One is a direct measure of total returns and the other is the post-release survival rate. To estimate total returns, sample surveys of commercial landings in fish markets have generally been used in Japan, and a general estimating method of effectiveness from a two-stage sample survey has been developed. Methods for estimating post-release mortality rates based on lag recoveries have also been developed for the problems of over dispersion and correlation caused by the aggregation and mixture of released individuals. Key factors for success, the impact of stocking on fisheries management and wild stocks are also discussed. The present challenge is how to use stock enhancement for sustainable fishery production in addition to the proper management of the wild stock. Scientific evaluation of stocking effectiveness and responsible use of hatchery enhancement are the key points in the coming phase of stock enhancement.",

Patterns and mechanisms observed over 25 years in a large kelp forest suggest that definition of a meaningful benchmark is impossible, because many of the large animals have been gone for years to decades, and kelps are sensitive to large-scale, low-frequency El Nino-Southern Oscillation events and longer term regime shifts. A shift in the oceanographic climate has significantly reduced the average size and carrying capacity of the dominant plant. The animals that have been functionally removed from the community include sea otters, black sea bass, yellowtail, white sea bass, and abalones. Other species are still present, but fisheries have had huge effects on the abundances, size-frequencies, and/or spatial distributions of sheephead, kelp bass, rays, flatfish, rock fish, spiny lobsters, and red sea urchins. Now even sea cucumbers, crabs, and small snails are subject to unregulated fishing. The plants continue to exist without a hint of the effects of the loss of so much animal biomass. Furthermore, most of the megafauna have been removed with very little documentation or historical understanding of what the natural community was like. Thus, our ability to separate anthropogenic impacts from the natural dynamics of the system is severely compromised. We discuss the importance of both an ecosystem focus on productivity and careful monitoring of as many populations as possible. In addition, we show that this community is not tightly integrated with mutual dependencies; hence, many species can be removed without much affecting the rest of the ecosystem.",10.2307/2641070

Over the past twenty-five years, bacterial pathogens associated with faecal contamination have represented only 4% of the shellfish-associated outbreaks, while naturally-occurring bacteria accounted for 20% of shellfish-related illnesses and 99% of the deaths. Most of these indigenous bacteria fall into the family Vibrionaceae which includes the genera Vibrio, Aeromonas and Plesiomonas. In general, Vibrio spp, are not associated with faecal contamination and therefore faecal indicators do not correlate with the presence of Vibrio. Viruses are the most significant cause of shellfish-associated disease: in New York State, for example, 33% and 62% of 196 outbreaks between 1981 and 1992 were caused by Norwalk virus and gastrointestinal viruses (small round structured viruses), respectively. In addition, several illnesses are a result of toxic algal blooms, the growth of naturally occurring bacteria and diatoms causing neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning, diarrhoetic shellfish poisoning, amnesic shellfish poisoning and ciguatera. Current estimates place the annual number of ciguatera cases at 20,000 world-wide. Scombroid poisoning is the most significant cause of illness associated with seafood. Scombrotoxin is of bacterial origin and halophilic Vibrio spp. causing high histamine levels are implicated as the source. Scombroid poisoning is geographically diverse and many species have been implicated, namely: tuna, mahi-mahi, bluefish, sardines, mackerel, amberjack and abalone. Temperature abuse has been cited as a major cause of scombroid poisoning. For routine work, the use of faecal indicators to predict the relative level of faecal contamination should not be disposed of. However, the main source of seafood illness is due to species which are not predicted by these organisms. In order to protect public health, routine surveillance using new pathogen-specific techniques such as polymerase chain reaction should be used. This, in combination with risk assessment methods and hazard analysis and critical control points, will begin to address the need for improvement in the safety of seafood.",10.20506/rst.16.2.1048

Fusion products between wild (brown color) and mutant (green color) type protoplasts and between pairs of protoplasts of wild type were visually identified and used to determine the fusion efficiency. Cell wall digestions were carried out in solutions consisting of two kinds of enzymes. One was derived from the marine bacterium Pseudomonas sp. and the other was from one of the following sources: abalones Natohaliotis discus (AAP), top shells Turbo cornutus (TSAP), sea hares Aplysia kurodai (SHAP) or sea urchins Anthocidaris crassispine (SUAP). Both AAP and TSAP, either one combined with bacterial crude enzymes, showed approximately similar effects on the protoplast fusion. Under these enzyme treatments, a maximum of 15 to 20% of the isolated protoplasts formed hybrids after exposure to electric pulses. However, their fusion activities were quite unstable and the fusion rates declined immediately. Thus, fusion rates were only a few percent even when protoplast isolation reached maximum. In the case of the combined SUAP and bacterial enzymes, optimal fusion rate of protoplasts also was observed at approximately 20% but protoplasts could form hybrids with relatively high rates (more than 10%) for at least 2 h during enzyme treatment. Conversely, little or no fusion product was obtained from the protoplasts prepared with the combined SHAP and bacterial enzyme or with the combination of partially purified enzyme from abalone and bacterial, although protoplast production was effective in these solutions. Consequently, the combination of SUAP and bacterial crude enzyme was the most efficient enzyme system for protoplast electrofusion among all the systems examined. In addition, study of the survival rates of the algal protoplasts suggested that the electrofusion efficiency would be largely influenced by the viability of protoplasts during treatment with the wall-lytic enzymes.",10.1016/0044-8486(92)90106-U

This condition is consistently linked to an increased cardio-metabolic risk. It is essential to evaluate this risk at the phenotype level to identify the most vulnerable subgroup within the PCOS population. Aim and Objectives: To phenotype the PCOS patients as per the standard Rotterdam's criteria and to assess the metabolic syndrome markers in those phenotypes. Material and Methods: A total of seven hundred participants (n=700) were assessed and categorized based on the Rotterdam criteria. Clinical, radiological, and biochemical assessments were conducted and analyzed statistically. Chi-square and two-way ANOVA tests were conducted using SPSS version 19 statistical software. The results indicated that phenotype A was the most prevalent, comprising 83.2% (583) of the cases, followed by phenotype C at 8% (56), phenotype D at 5.55% (39), and phenotype B at 3.1% (22). Notably, phenotype B, while being the least prevalent, exhibited the highest metabolic risk. This phenotype was significantly associated with increased levels of hirsutism, postprandial hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and hormonal imbalances. Additionally, although not statistically significant, there was a higher occurrence of family history of metabolic syndrome, elevated waist circumference (greater than 35 inches), obesity, stress, and dyslipidemia associated with this phenotype. Conclusion: The highest metabolic risk was observed in phenotype B, which was characterized by a combination of hyperandrogenism and irregular menstruation in the absence of polycystic ovaries.",

However, the threat has not been estimated for the coming decades in a form that meets the needs of these industries. Tasmanian fisheries and aquaculture in southeast Australia have been severely impacted by marine heatwaves in recent years, especially the oyster, abalone, and salmon industries. In a series of semi-structured interviews with key Tasmanian fishery and aquaculture stakeholders, information was gathered about the following: (i) the impacts they have experienced to date from marine heatwaves, (ii) their planning for future marine heatwaves, and (iii) the information that would be most useful to aid planning. Using CMIP6 historical and future simulations of sea surface temperatures around Tasmania, we developed a marine heatwave hazard index guided by these stakeholder conversations. The region experienced a severe marine heatwave during the austral summer of 2015/16, which has been used here as a reference point to define the index. Our marine heatwave hazard index shows that conditions like those experienced in 2015/16 are projected to occur approximately 1-in-5 years by the 2050s under a low emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) or 1-in-2 years under a high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5). Increased frequency of marine heatwaves will likely reduce productivity by both direct (mortality) and in-direct (ecosystem change, greater incidence of disease) impacts on target species. The illustrative hazard index is one step towards a marine heatwave risk index, which would also need to consider aspects of exposure and vulnerability to be of greater utility to stakeholders.",10.1007/s10584-024-03684-8

Although the heritability of shell color variation has been conducted by experimental crossing, little is known about molecular basis involved in these patterns. Tyrosinase-like proteins are important enzymes which are members of the type-3 copper protein superfamily. In this research, two tyrosinase-like protein genes including CgTyp-1 and CgTyp-3 were identified in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Tissue expression analysis showed that CgTyp-1 and CgTyp-3 were dominantly expressed in the mantle. Particularly, they were expressed significantly higher in the edge mantle than that in the central mantle whether on the left or right mantles. Additionally, expressions of CgTyp-1 and CgTyp-3 were mainly found in the black shell color oysters, with relative lower levels in the white shell color oysters. In situ hybridization showed that positive signals for CgTyp-1 and CgTyp-3 were both detected within the outer epithelium of the outer fold either in the black or white shell color oysters. After interference, the expression levels of CgTyp-1 and CgTyp-3 mRNA were significantly attenuated, and the efficiency of RNAi reached 84.72% and 71.58%, respectively. Besides, knockdown CgTyp-1 or CgTyp-3, obviously decreased the tyrosinase activity of mantles. Furthermore, the number of the melanosomes within epithelium of the outer fold was sharply reduced by silencing of each Typ. These findings argue that CgTyp-1 and CgTyp-3 may be involved in the melanin synthesis, which lends insight into regulation mechanism of shell pigmentation in C. gigas.",10.1016/j.gene.2022.146742

Twenty-four HPL male patients and 10 age-matched controls (H LT) were enrolled. Early morning fasting blood and urine samples were collected on days 0 and 14th of TCE treatment and subjected to lipid profiling and Q-TOF-MS analysis. Multivariate analysis showed urinary levels of urocanic acid, hydroxyphenylacetate, linolenic acid, phenylpropionate, hypoxanthine, and indole acetate produced by Peptostreptococcs asaccharolyticus, Clostridium difficile, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bifidobacterium, Subdoligranulum, Lactobacillus, Clostridium sporogenes, E. coli were depleted in HPL patients as compared to healthy controls. In contrast, levels of serotonin, acetylleucine, hippuric acid, and arabinitol were found to be increased (>2.0 fold, p<0.005). However, TCE treatment reverted the levels of these metabolites and therefore, gut microflora. Also, Cloacibacterium haliotis, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, and Bifidobacterium population decreased in HPL patients. Increased secretion of yeast or Candida albicans associated metabolites was because of their increased population.

A new species, Anoplodiscus hutsonae n. sp. is proposed for museum specimens originally collected from species of Scolopsis Cuvier (Nemipteridae) off Heron Island and Lizard Island, Australia. Additionally, Anoplodiscus tai Ogawa, 1994 is synonymised with Anoplodiscus cirrusspiralis Roubal, Armitage & Rohde, 1983 due to a lack of support for differential characters, and Anoplodiscus richiardii is considered a species inquirenda. Anoplodiscus cirrusspiralis causes visible lesions on the skin and fins of its host, and may also contribute to poor food conversion rates in sparid aquaculture. Anoplodiscus cirrusspiralis has been recorded from cultured sparids in Australia, Japan, South Africa, and South Korea, and was implicated as a disease agent in fish from the former two countries. However, the discovery of A. cirrusspiralis on Chrysoblephus gibbiceps (Valenciennes), Ch. laticeps (Valenciennes) and Cymatoceps nasutus (Castelnau) in South Africa, ?Pagrus major (Temminck & Schlegel) in South Korea, and P. auratus (Forster) in Australia, New Zealand and Japan suggests that this species may have a wide distribution and low host-specificity within the Sparidae.

"Punt, AE; Deng, RA; Siddeek, MSM; Buckworth, RC; Vanek, V",Data weighting for tagging data in integrated size-structured models,2017,FISHERIES RESEARCH,192,,94,102,,"Increasingly, stock assessments for hard-to-age species such as crabs, prawns, rock lobsters, and abalone are being based on integrated size-structured population dynamics models that are fit to a variety of data sources. These data sources include tagging data to inform growth. Diagnostic statistics and plots have been developed to explore how well integrated population models fit the data types typically used for assessment purposes (index data, size- and age-compositions, and conditional age-at-length data). However, such statistics and plots are not available for tagging data, when these data are used to estimate growth. This paper outlines two diagnostic statistics that can be used to evaluate fits to tagging data, and develops a method based on 'Francis weighting' for weighting tagging data in integrated models. For illustration, the methods are applied to Aleutian Islands golden king crab (Lithodes aequispinus) in Alaska, and tiger prawns (Penaeus semisulcatus and P. esculentus) in Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery. Some degree of growth model mis-specification was revealed for P. semisulcatus, and there were conflicts in the data for the tiger prawns. The standard errors for the estimates of mature male biomass for golden king crab were larger when the tagging data were downweighted based on the proposed weighting method. This serves to emphasise that assessments and their interpretations can be impacted by how tagging data are weighted. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The phospho-metabolite profile of a living organism is often indicative of imbalances that may have been caused by environmental stressors, such as surfactants. This study utilizes in vivo P-31 NMR to monitor temporal changes in the phospho-metabolite profile of Artemia caused by Tx-100, CPC, and SDS and the ability of humic acid (HA) to mitigate the toxicity of these surfactants. It was found that, while Tx-100 does not have any effect on the phospho-metabolite profile, both CPC and SDS cause a complete retardation in growth of the phosphodiester (PDE) peak in the P-31 NMR spectrum, which is indicative of the inhibited cell replication. This growth inhibition was independently verified by the decreased guanosine triphosphate (GTP) concentration in the CPC and SDS-exposed Artemia. In addition, upon introduction of HA to the CPC and SDS-exposed Artemia, an increase of PDE peak over time is indicative of HA mitigating toxicity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Untreated adult thalli and unmanipulated specimens served as controls. Fragments of both species were attached to boulders or rock platforms with elastic bands or cyanoacrylate glue. Transplanted fragments quickly formed new haptera, colonized new substrata, and reached reproductive maturity. Macrocystis regenerates increased in total length and holdfast diameter in one or both directions of the rhizome, forming a pair of stipes, followed by rhizome and haptera development. In Lessonia, tissue of non-injured zones took over new holdfast growth. Success of this propagation method varied with season and substrata. Both species proceeded to complete regeneration of holdfasts. However, holdfasts of older Macrocystis thalli partly decomposed, resulting in two apparently identical individuals. Advantages of these propagation methods are discussed in ecological and restoration contexts.",10.1007/s10811-016-0827-2

In the southern Benguela, most of South Africa's commercial fisheries have a long history of exploitation and this, coupled with spatio-temporal changes in key species over the last three decades has severely impacted some of South Africa's fisheries and ecosystems. This review summarizes these spatio-temporal changes and investigates possible drivers thereof. It incorporates both past and current research, with a large portion of the latter having formed part of the University of Cape Town's Ma-Re BASICS (Marine Research in the Benguela and Agulhas Systems for supporting Interdisciplinary Climate-change Science) 2010-2013 program. Almost all described changes involve a temporal decline or a spatial shift in species. Fishing seems to have played a role in many of the observed stock declines, for example through geographically disproportionate catches in relation to stock distribution. In some cases, changes in the physical environment seem to have played an additional role, e.g., rock lobsters on the west coast have been affected by fishing as well as changes in the physical environment. In almost all cases these changes have taken place since the 1980s/1990s, except for one or two resources, which have experienced declines since at least the mid 20th century. Spatial shifts in species have either involved an eastward expansion of cool-water species, including kelps, rock lobster and pelagic fish, or a retraction of warm-water species such as the brown mussel, suggesting a cooling of inshore waters along the south-west coast since the 1980s. This suggested cooling is revealed in ocean temperature (SST Pathfinder), wind and upwelling data for the Cape Peninsula and south-west coast region during the same period. The absence or inconsistency of long-term data is problematic when trying to identify drivers of ecosystem change, and actual ecosystem change itself. We discuss this using ocean temperature in the southern Benguela as an example. In addition, the complex interplay between climate and anthropogenic (notably fishing) drivers makes identification of drivers difficult and disentangling these combined effects will require interdisciplinary collaboration, co-ordinated ecosystem projects, increased modelling effort and the continuation, but also establishment, of new, long-term monitoring studies.

Aquaculture of the species exists in close proximity to native populations, but very little is known about the health of native populations. Baseline information on endosymbiont identification, prevalence, intensity, and geographic distribution are necessary to facilitate management and/or mitigation of potential disease interactions between cultured and natural shellfish stocks. A survey of Pacific geoduck (P. generosa) parasites from three natural populations in Washington state (Totten Inlet, Thorndyke Bay, Freshwater Bay) was conducted in 2008 to 2010. Histopathology of 634 animals was used to explore trends of parasite presence and to identify potential environmental factors (site distribution, collection depth, and season) that influence parasite assemblages. Endosymbionts observed on histological examination included Rickettsia-like organisms (RLOs) in the ctenidia (n = 246); an unidentified metazoan parasite in the siphon epithelium (n = 220); and microsporidia-like species in the intestine (n = 103), siphonmuscle (n = 28), and ova (a Steinhausia-like parasite; n = 99). This study reveals the presence of three microsporidia-like organisms (including Steinhausia-like parasites) not previously described in geoducks. Assemblages of most parasites showed strong seasonal variations and site-specific distributions throughout the year. The presence of Rickettsia-like organisms may be driven by seasonal elevated temperatures, and was extremely common at Freshwater Bay. Metazoans and microsporidia were common in South Puget Sound and exhibited high infection intensity year-round. Spawning season drove Steinhausia-like parasite presence with no spatial driver.

The South African coastline comprises several distinct coastal ecoregions that support a wide range of coastal (inshore) ecosystems, including rocky, sandy and mixed shores, kelp beds, estuaries and seagrass communities. A growing body of evidence indicates that local air and sea temperatures, wind patterns, ocean current speed and upwelling regimes are all being affected by human-mediated climate change. In addition, anthropogenic activities, such as shipping (introducing coastal bioinvasives), exploitation of coastal marine resources, industry (releasing pollutants) and urban development, act synergistically with climate change to place pressure on coastal ecosystems and their biota. The aim of this review was primarily to synthesise and update research into causes of direct and indirect human-mediated global change and their effects on South African coastal systems. It incorporates both historic and the latest regional research on climate change and anthropogenic threats across the ecosystems listed above, much of which was supported by the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research (SANCOR), specifically the SEAChange programme in recent years. It is evident that all these ecosystems are vulnerable to all the drivers considered, albeit to differing degrees, depending on their location on the coast. Whereas some bioinvasives have had a dramatic impact on rocky shore systems on the West Coast, their impact has been moderate on the South Coast and minimal on the East Coast; exploitation shows the reverse pattern. Furthermore, the impacts of human-mediated drivers on coastal ecosystems are synergistic. Of major interest is the fact that the West Coast and parts of the South Coast are exhibiting cooling trends in offshore sea surface temperatures, rather than warming. Correspondingly, a geographical spread of organisms associated with West and South-West Coast rocky shores and kelp beds has tended to be eastwards around Cape Point, rather than northwards along the West Coast as would have been expected with warming sea temperatures. Overall, significant progress has been made toward a better understanding of the combined pressures on each ecosystem and knowledge gaps have been identified, thus helping to direct future research themes.",10.2989/1814232X.2013.830147

The commercially-important West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii is one of these, and its shift in distribution has had profound effects on the rest of the ecosystem along the south-west coast. Reasons for these shifts are not fully understood, but are probably linked to changes in environmental conditions. We applied a sequential t-test algorithm for analyzing regime shifts (STARS) to physical (wind and upwelling) and biological (rock-lobster catch and growth, Bank Cormorant abundance) data for the southern Benguela inshore region and performed sensitivity tests on each of the variables. Regime shifts were defined as 'robust' or 'possible' if they were detected for >= 70% or >= 60% of the sensitivity tests respectively. To corroborate the shifts detected by STARS, we then applied two additional methods: change point analysis and the Chow breakpoint test. The STARS method outperformed the other two methods because it could handle shorter time series and detect shifts towards the end of the time series, but most of the significant shifts detected by STARS were also detected by one or both of the other methods. A significant shift in Cape Point winter winds occurred in 1983, an El Nino year. However, measurement methodology changed during the same period and this is discussed in relation to the shift. A decline in rock-lobster growth rate occurred in the mid 1980s, and significant increases in upwelling variability and mean summer winds were detected in the early-to-mid 1990s - the same period in which rock lobster abundance underwent an eastward shift, declining on the west coast and increasing on the southwest coast. Bank Cormorants underwent respective declines and increases in the mid-to-late 1990s on the west and south-west coasts following the shift in lobsters. Further shifts in mean wind and upwelling were detected in the 2000s. These results are a step towards developing ecosystem indicators for the region, which can be monitored with the intended use of providing an early warning system for long-term, ecosystem-scale changes.

Primary genotypic and phenotypic identification including 16S rDNA sequence analysis, multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) of four housekeeping genes (gapA, ftsZ, mreB and topA) and biochemical tests suggested that strain MM5 was a Vibrio species closest to but different from Vibrio furnissii. Our previous study indicated that MM5 could induce a high mortality of M. meretrix (Yue et al., 2010). Quantitative challenge test was performed in this study to further evaluate the pathogenic potential of MM5, which showed that at 84 h post-inoculation, the cumulative mortalities of the MM5-injected group were significantly higher than those of control groups (P < 0.05). Cytopathological and histopathological features of the clam infected by MM5 were carried out by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, respectively. Cytopathologically, foci of MM5 were found in hepatocytes of the clam infected by MM5. In addition, cytopathological lesion was detected in foot of infected clam. Histopathologically, MM5 was detected in different tissues of infected clam, including hepatopancreas, mantle and gill. Challenge test combined with pathological features indicated that MM5 was virulent to M. meretrix. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.jip.2010.10.006

Protein profiles and IgE-binding proteins were detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel-electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting using sera from 23 patients with positive skin prick test to raw squid extract. SDS-PAGE of the raw extract exhibited 21 protein bands (10-170 kDa) but those ranging from 19 to 29 kDa and 41 to 94 kDa were not found in the cooked extract. Immunoblotting of raw extract demonstrated 16 IgE-binding bands, ranging from 13 to 170 kDa. A heat-resistant 36 kDa protein, corresponding to squid tropomyosin, was identified as the major allergen of both extracts. In addition, a 50 kDa heat-sensitive protein was shown to be a major allergen of the raw extract. Our findings indicate that the allergen extract used for diagnosis of squid allergy should contain both the 36 kDa and 50 kDa proteins.",

Five of the six species (collected at Wreck Rock, Western Australia in 1985) exhibited a high turnover of phosphorus (P) relative to nitrogen (N). In contrast to N, P turnover was related to the concentration of P in body tissues. A relatively high demand for P in the diet is required to support the observed rapid turnover of P with respect to N.

The high respiration rate of newly released larvae (mean=306.3 pmol O-2 larva(-1) h(-1), range=149.3 to 466.6, n=18 trials, 22.5 degrees C) from adults collected at Link Port, Fort Pierce, Florida during the winter/spring of 1990-1991 reflects their active swimming behavior. The average energy content per larva was 15.24 mJ (range: 13.35 to 20.17 mJ ind(-1), n=5 groups). If all cells have an identical energy content and metabolic rate, then 2 and 20% of the total energy content would be consumed by the onset (2 h post-release) and the loss (24 h post-release) of metamorphic competence. Larvae of B. neritina are a composite of both larval and juvenile tissues and the loss of metamorphic competence may be due to regional depletion of labile energy stores in transitory ''larval'' cells, particularly the ciliated cells that comprise the locomotory organ, the corona. Although ''nonfeeding'', B. neritina larvae can acquire nutrients from the environment in the form of dissolved organic materials (DOM) in seawater. Both the amino acid alanine and the fatty acid palmitic acid can be transported from seawater ([S]=1 mu M, 22.5 degrees C). The rates of alanine influx (appearance of label in tissue) averaged 0.366 pmol larva(-1) h(-1) and, based on comparisons between rates of solute transport and metabolism, would contribute little (<1% of required energy) to offset the metabolic demand. The average rate of palmitic acid influx was 4.668 pmol larva(-1) h-l and, assuming that the measured influx equals the net solute flux, could account for 21 to 72% of energy requirements. These data suggest that the duration of planktonic life of B. neritina larvae is principally regulated by the amount of endogenous energy stores, but may be modulated by available DOM in seawater.",10.1007/BF00354313

The use of 5% dymethyl sulfoxide as a cryoprotectant resulted in greater cell survival and a scarcity of destroyed cells lacking cytosol among dead cells. In this case, almost all cells died through necrosis or apoptosis, which appeared to increase in mussel cell cultures after a freeze-thaw cycle. Apoptosis was not a main death pathway in mussel cells, but it was induced in a significant part of these cells (up to 24%) immediately after thawing and depended mostly on the cryoprotectant used. Regardless of the type of the used cryoprotectant, we observed some nuclear aberrations in cells after freezing-thawing, such as few multipolar mitoses or the absence of a division spindle in mitotic cells. After analyzing different methods for assessing cell damage, the best results were obtained from optimal approaches that could provide information regarding the cell disruption level after freezing-thawing and could be considered for future studies.

Pavanelliella jcrrii sp. n. is characterized by the presence of 3-4 rings in the male copulatory organ, the absence of rings around the vaginal atrium and by its sinuous vaginal canal, which sometimes forms 0.5-1 rings in the distal portion. The sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal DNA (ssrDNA) and internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS-1) of three species of Pavanelliella, Vancleaveus cicinnus, and an undetermined dactylogyrid allowed the phylogenetic reconstruction of these dactylogyrids. The analysis indicated that P. jarii sp. n. is closely related to Pavanelliella takemotoi and Pavanelliella pavanellii, which formed a sister Glade to ancylodiscoidines parasites of siluriform fish from the Oriental and Afrotropical regions. The analysis also corroborated the non-monophyly of Ancyrocephalinae, revealing that ancylodiscoidines arose between ancyrocephalines lineages, in a sister relationship to pseudodactylogyrines + marine ancyrocephalines + ancyrocephalines parasites of afrotropical perciforms + dactylogyrines. Cladistical analysis indicates that the haptoral anchor/bar complex has been lost several times in the evolutionary history of Dactylogyridae.

By integrating enhanced random feature mapping and dynamic pseudo-input selection, MSGP achieves significantly improved computational efficiency while maintaining competitive predictive performance. Although some combinations of feature mapping and pseudo-input selection may show reduced accuracy in specific datasets, MSGP generally outperforms standard GPR on benchmark datasets. For example, on the Winequality-red dataset, MSGP-C reduces computation time to 0.61 s versus GPR's 14.45 s, with comparable accuracy (88.92% versus 90.26%). On the high-dimensional Online News Popularity dataset, MSGP achieves improved accuracy as dimensionality increases. MSGP also demonstrates stable computation times and improved error metrics as volume grows in the Bike Sharing dataset. Robustness tests show MSGP performs reliably in noisy environments (e.g. 94.17% accuracy on noisy Abalone data in 2.91 s versus GPR's 138.32 s). However, in certain complex datasets, such as Abalone with static pseudo-input selection, MSGP may show lower accuracy. These results highlight MSGP's potential as a scalable and robust solution for large-scale machine learning, while future work will focus on improving performance on smaller datasets and optimizing tuning.",10.1093/comjnl/bxaf066

In a few mollusk species, these bacteria have been associated with mortality events and production losses. The type of relationship between the RLOs and the pleasure oyster is largely unknown and further investigations are needed to determine if these bacteria warrant management concern in C. corteziensis . In this study, the morphological characteristics of the RLOs were studied by histology and SEM, and the taxonomic affiliations of the bacteria were evaluated by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. In addition, the prevalence and intensity of the RLOs was recorded from 2007 to 2017 by histology. The RLOs were observed inside circular basophilic cytoplasmic membrane bound vacuoles (MBVs) that had an average length and width of 15.70 +/- 15.24 mu m and 15.42 +/- 14.95 mu m respectively. Apart from cellular hypertrophy, no tissue alterations were observed in the areas adjacent to the RLOs. Individual bacteria within the MBVs were coccoid in shape with an average length of 0.65 +/- 0.12 mu m and an average width of 0.38 +/- 0.09 mu m. The bacterial microbiota of a selected number of samples (one sample without RLOs and two samples with RLOs) showed the presence of intracellular parasite OTUs corresponding to the families Rickettsiaceae and Anaplasmataceae, suggesting that the RLOs from the pleasure oyster is associated with the order Rickettsiales . A mean prevalence of 5 % was observed throughout the study period and the majority of the organisms (89 %) presented low intensity of Grade 1 (30 -61 RLOs) of the MBVs. A higher prevalence of the RLOs was observed during warmer months. The lack of tissue alterations, the low prevalence and the low intensity of the MBVs suggest that the RLOs from C. corteziensis is a commensal endosymbiont that presents little risk for oyster production in Nayarit, Me xico.

Land-based aquaculture of red seaweed typically employ tumble culture systems, where compressed air is delivered to the bottom of the tank to provide gas exchange and promote mixing. However, aeration is a potentially costly process because compressed air must be bubbled into the liquid, and power is required to drive the air compressor. In this study, fundamental relationships between aeration rate, biomass productivity, and aeration power consumption were developed for tumble tank cultivation of the red seaweed Pacific dulse under CO2-replete growth conditions. The biomass productivity (g biomass L-1 d-1) of D. mollis in tumble culture was measured over seven weekly harvest cycles over a range of aeration rates (0.086-0.684 L air L-1 liquid min-1) for fine-bubble (1-5 mm) and coarse-bubble (2-3 cm) aerators, and then correlated to the CO2 transfer rate (CO2-TR, mmol CO2 L-1 h-1). The CO2-TR consolidated aeration rate, CO2 partial pressure, boundary layer diffusion, and gas sparger characteristics (bubble size, interfacial area) into a single parameter. This analysis required measurements of the gas-to-liquid mass transfer coefficient (kLa) for estimation of CO2-TR, and pressure drop across the gas diffuser for aeration power consumption. CO2-replete biomass productivity required a CO2-TR that was three times the CO2 demand. For fine-bubble aeration, both CO2-TR and aeration power consumption were higher than for coarse-bubble aeration over the range of aeration rates tested. However, when the aeration rate needed to achieve CO2-replete biomass productivity was approached, fine-bubble aeration required less energy consumption due to lower aeration requirement. The optimum was achieved at an aeration rate of 0.26 L air L-1 culture min-1 using fine-bubble aeration, which provided an areal biomass productivity of 490 g FW m- 2 d-1 (fresh mass) or 32 g AFDW m- 2 d-1 (ash-free dry mass), at an aeration energy power requirement of 1.5 kWh/kg FW (22 kWh/kg AFDW). Overall, this study showed that aeration systems can easily limit biomass productivity and result in high aeration energy consumption per kg of biomass produced if the aeration processes are not thoughtfully considered. The key tradeoff was that aeration energy consumption increased significantly as CO2-replete biomass productivity was approached. Therefore, optimization would require the use of an aerator system that provides the best possible kLa and lowest pressure drop at the lowest possible aeration rate.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.740638

With this review we want to draw attention to less recognized mechanisms behind vector-borne transmission pathways to humans. We have focused on how the immune systems of edible marine shellfish, the blue mussels and Norway lobsters, are affected by climate related environmental stressors. Future ocean acidification (OA) and warming due to climate change constitute a gradually increasing persistent stress with negative trade-off for many organisms. In addition, the stress of recurrent hypoxia, inducing high levels of bioavailable manganese (Mn) is likely to increase in line with climate change. We summarized that OA, hypoxia and elevated levels of Mn did have an overall negative effect on immunity, in some cases also with synergistic effects. On the other hand, moderate increase in temperature seems to have a stimulating effect on antimicrobial activity and may in a future warming scenario counteract the negative effects. However, rising sea surface temperature and climate events causing high land run-off promote the abundance of naturally occurring pathogenic Vibrio and will in addition, bring enteric pathogens which are circulating in society into coastal waters. Moreover, the observed impairments of the immune defense enhance the persistence and occurrence of pathogens in shellfish. This may increase the risk for direct transmission of pathogens to consumers. It is thus essential that in the wake of climate change, sanitary control of coastal waters and seafood must recognize and adapt to the expected alteration of host-pathogen interactions.",10.1016/j.envres.2017.11.032

"Traini, C; Menier, D; Proust, JN; Sorrel, P",Transgressive systems tract of a ria-type estuary: The Late Holocene Vilaine River drowned valley (France),2013,MARINE GEOLOGY,337,,140,155,,"The understanding of control parameters of estuarine-infilling at different scales in time and space is important for near-future projections and better management of these areas facing sea-level change. During the last 20 years, the stratigraphy of late Quaternary estuaries has been extensively investigated leading to the development of depositional models which describe the sedimentary facies distribution according to changes in sea level, tidal range and wave activity but few of them describe in detail the influence of the estuarine geomorphology. On the Atlantic coast, recent studies provide a detailed understanding of the sedimentary infill succession of incised valleys during the late Holocene transgression with recent emphasis on the macrotidal bay of the Vilaine River in South Brittany. The latter has shown the importance of the inherited morphology in controlling the preservation of the sedimentary deposits. However, until now, there has been little information available on the geometry of the underlying bedrock of the estuary and its immediate approaches including the Holocene history of the most proximal part of the Vilaine River estuary. The recent acquisition of very-high resolution seismic reflection (Chirp) and sediment core data in the Vilaine Estuary provides the opportunity to address several of these issues leading to the identification of the controlling factors that played a role in the sedimentary filling of the estuary. The estuary of the Vilaine River is one of the most sheltered estuaries of the Atlantic coast and thus shows an excellent record of the successive transgressive phases since the last glacial period. The valley of this ria-type estuary is incised in the Hercynian magmatic and metamorphic rocks of the Armorican Massif along the striking branches of the South Armorican Shear Zone and filled with well-stratified sediments. The study of the morphology of the substratum in the estuary reveals narrow paleovalleys (I km wide) with a maximum depth of 20 m. The shapes and dimensions of these paleovalleys are comparable with those observed upstream in the present-day Vilaine River valley. Fades analysis of seismic and sedimentary data, complemented by 21 AMS radiocarbon age dating, enables the reconstruction of the infilling of the estuarine valley. The valley is filled by Pleistocene to early Holocene alluvial, coarse-grained, pebbly sands overlain by mid- to late Holocene marine sands, silts and muds. From 10,000 to 5000 cal. BP, the marine transgression shows a rapid initial phase of transgression followed by a progressive slowing down which can be recognised over more than 90 km in an upstream direction. The rapid transgression developed homogeneously over the entire length of the estuary with a widespread expression of tidal currents (tide-dominated estuary). The slow phase of the transgression gives rise to a differentiated expression of the hydrodynamic factors according to the geomorphological setting. The sedimentary deposits of the innermost and narrow part of the estuary reflect a strong control of tidal and river currents when the influence of tidal currents increases at the expense of fluvial control in a downstream direction. The sedimentary filling of the outer reaches of estuary shows a strong influence of tidal currents modulated by changes in sea level where, from 5700 to 3000 cal. BP, the progressive decrease in accommodation space promotes the expression of wave action (wave-dominated estuary). Finally, from 5000 years BP to present day, the stabilisation of sea level gives birth to scour and lag sedimentary morphologies (scour and lag estuary). The sedimentary record appears thus strongly marked by the Holocene transgression and the geomorphological setting where hydrodynamic parameters superimposed on the geomorphological and eustatic contexts expressed in different ways in time and space govern the evolution of the estuarine system.

For a long time it was believed that only protozoa, bacteria, and fungi, in addition to plants and photosynthetic bacteria, are able to synthesize cellulases encoded by their own genes. However, the widespread distribution of cellulases throughout the animal kingdom has recently been recognized. Conventionally, animals digest cellulose utilizing cellulases derived from symbiotic bacteria in the digestive organs. However, recent molecular biological studies have shown that some cellulase genes are actually encoded on animal chromosomes. In addition, the homologous primary structure of cellulases obtained from various invertebrate phyla indicates the possible vertical transfer of the cellulase gene from ancient organisms that are now extinct. The results of studies on cellulases with unique enzymatic properties are expected to be applied to bioethanol production and aquaculture.

Although BRD infection is often lethal, some clams recover by mineralizing a new repair shell layer, which covers the brown deposit and fully isolates it from living tissues. In order to understand this specific shell repair process, the microstructures of repaired zones were compared to those of shells unaffected by BRD. In addition, the organic matrix associated with unaffected shells and to repair patches were extracted and compared by biochemical and immunological techniques. Our results show that the repaired zones exhibit microstructures that resemble the so-called homogeneous microstructure of the internal layer, with some marked differences, like the development of crossed-acicular crystals, which form chevron-like patterns. In the three tested batches of repaired layers, the matrices exhibit certain heterogeneity, i.e., they are partially to widely different from the ones of shells unaffected by BRD, as illustrated by SOS-PAGE and by serological comparisons. Our results strongly suggest a modification of the secretory regime of calcifying mantle cells during the shell repair process. Polyclonal antibodies, which were developed against specific protein fractions of the shell, represent relevant tools for localizing by immunohistology the cells responsible for the repair.

The main digestive enzymes (amylase and proteinases) were not detectable in one-day-old juveniles, and increased during development. The stomach, including digestive glands, was the major digestive organ for both carbohydrate and protein. The optimum conditions for amylase activity were 40 degrees C and pH 7; for acidic proteinases they were 60 degrees C and pH 5. Two main alkaline proteinases were found in the intestine, with optimum conditions of 30 degrees C and pH 8 and 60 degrees C and pH 8. To improve mussel survival by finding suitable phytoplankton species and age as food for juveniles and adults, an in-vitro digestibility test was performed on ten algal species three and seven days old using amylase and proteinases in crude enzyme extracts from different mussel life stages.

The most recent advances deal more particularly with the structure of shell biominerals at nanoscale and the identification of an increasing number of shell matrix protein components. Although the matrix is quantitatively a minor constituent in the shell of mollusks (less than 5% w/w), it is, however, the major component that controls different aspects of the shell formation processes: synthesis of transient amorphous minerals and evolution to crystalline phases, choice of the calcium carbonate polymorph (calcite vs aragonite), organization of crystallites in complex shell textures (microstructures). Until recently, the classical paradigm in molluscan shell biomineralization was to consider that the control of shell synthesis was performed primarily by two antagonistic mechanisms: crystal nucleation and growth inhibition. New concepts and emerging models try now to translate a more complex reality, which is remarkably illustrated by the wide variety of shell proteins, characterized since the mid-1990s, and described in this chapter. These proteins cover a broad spectrum of pI, from very acidic to very basic. The primary structure of a number of them is composed of different modules, suggesting that these proteins are multifunctional. Some of them exhibit enzymatic activities. Others may be involved in cell signaling. The oldness of shell proteins is discussed, in relation with the Cambrian appearance of the mollusks as a mineralizing phylum and with the Phanerozoic evolution of this group. Nowadays, the extracellular calcifying shell matrix appears as a whole integrated system, which regulates protein-mineral and protein-protein interactions as well as feedback interactions between the biominerals and the calcifying epithelium that synthesized them. Consequently, the molluscan shell matrix may be a source of bioactive molecules that would offer interesting perspectives in biomaterials and biomedical fields.

We investigated local enhancement of trochus Trochus niloticus (Gastropoda) on 3 coral reefs in Western Australia. 12 000 tiny hatchery-produced juveniles, 1 to 4 mm basal shell width (BSW), were released onto each of 4 intertidal sites on each reef. Visual surveys were conducted at stocked sites and control sites on each reef at 3-monthly intervals. Juvenile trochus <25 mm BSW hide within the reef matrix and are found rarely on the upper reef surfaces, so detectable enhancement was expected from 12 mo after release, when they would be at sub-adult size (25 to 50 mm BSW). Abundance estimates of wild sub-adults fluctuated seasonally, and appear related to heat stress; i.e. they tended to be more exposed on the reef surface in periods of higher cloud cover and/or lower temperature. A cyclical trend in the abundance of sub-adult trochus is attributed to seasonal variation in their visibility in censuses. Temporal changes in adult abundance showed no consistent pattern. Due to the lag in detecting stocking of sub-adults and the cyclical nature of population estimates, we tested stocking success using a nonlinear mixed-effects model. From 12 to 18 mo post-release, sub-adults at stocked sites were more abundant (54% increase) compared to control sites. Although statistically significant, the absolute enhancement was small. Variation in the stocking effect among sites underscores the need for multiple sites in restocking. Releases of tiny, cultured trochus juveniles could be used to rebuild nucleus breeding populations for fishery restocking, but improved release methods leading to higher survival of juveniles are needed to make this approach cost-effective.",10.3354/ab00253

Subjects with reported allergy to hake, yellowtail, salmon and mackerel were investigated by means of skin-prick tests, RASTs and Western blot analysis. For those subjects with test results that were either all negative or equivocal, a definitive diagnosis of clinical sensitivity was made on the basis of DBPCFC. Setting. Volunteer population-based cohort in the Western Gape. Participants. 105 volunteer subjects with suspected fish allergy were recruited by advertising in the local press. Main outcome. Species-specific bony fish allergy was confirmed or refuted by DBPCFC. Results. The four most common seafood species reported to cause adverse reactions were prawns (46.7%), crayfish (43.8%), abalone (35.2%) and black mussels (33.3%). The four most common bony fish species to cause reactions were hake (24.8%), yellowtail (21.9%), salmon (15.2%) and mackerel (15.2%). Seven DBPCFCs were performed and two open challenges. Skin-prick tests produced one false-negative result. Western blots produced one false-negative and one false-positive result. The PAST had a 100% correlation with DBPCFC. Conclusions. Local bony fish represent a significant cause of clinical reactions to seafood in the Western Cape. Although skin-prick tests, RASTs and Western blotting tests assist in the documentation of an IgE responder state, confirmation of clinical sensitivity can only be made with certainty by means of DBPCFC.",

Physicochemical parameters such as temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, pH, chlorophyll-a, rainfall within the last 48 h, total dissolved solids, and atmospheric pressure were also recorded to evaluate if there was a correlation between environmental parameters and the level of Shewanella. The highest total Shewanella counts were 1.8 x 107 CFU/g in oysters and 4.0 x 102 CFU/mL in seawater. 16S rRNA sequencing was performed on 1,344 representative isolates of which 890 (713 oyster, 177 seawater) were confirmed as Shewanella within 16 species. The top four species isolated from oysters and seawater were S. khirikhana a known shrimp pathogen (49%), S. marisflavi (19%), S. loihica (11%), and S. algae (8%). Testing for alpha and beta hemolysis were performed on all confirmed Shewanella isolates. Beta hemolysis was observed in 405 (46%) of the isolates of which 313 were in oysters and 92 in seawater. In oysters, beta-hemolysis was most prevalent in S. khirikhana (233 of 344 isolates, 68%), while in seawater 64 of 92 isolates (70%) were beta-hemolytic strains. Beta-hemolysis suggests that these could be potentially pathogenic strains. Correlations were performed between physicochemical attributes of the seawater and Shewanella counts. Only seawater temperature and dissolved oxygen correlated with Shewanella counts (r = 0.45 and - 0.41), respectively. No correlations were observed between the physicochemical parameters and Shewanella abundances in oysters.

Here, we assess the role of these factors in the variation of predicted larval dispersal and settlement patterns from 15 locations around Aotearoa New Zealand.Methods The Moana Project Backbone circulation model paired with OpenDrift was used to simulate Lagrangian larval dispersal in the ocean with basic vertical control across four differing PLD groups (7, 14, 30, and 70 days) for each of twelve months.Results Considerable variation was observed in the pattern of particle dispersal for each major variable: release location, PLD group, and the month of release. As expected, dispersal distances increased with PLD length, but the size of this effect differed across both release location and month. Increased and directional particle dispersal matched some expectations from well-known currents, but surprisingly high self-recruitment levels were recorded in some locations.Discussion These predictions of larval dispersal provide, for the first time, an empirical overview of coastal larval dispersal around Aoteaora New Zealand's main islands and highlight potential locations of barriers to dispersal. This dataset should prove valuable in helping predict larval connectivity across a broad range of species in this environment for diverse purposes.",10.3389/fmars.2023.1292081

LNF and MF were effective in shortening the entire freezing period and their muscle tissue microscopic structures were more homogeneous and thicker than the RF group, also with smaller and more regular ice crystal. Additionally, the LNF-treated samples had good water holding capacity and textural characteristics and significantly delayed changes in immobilized water content, effectively suppressing the increase in L* values in grass carp samples (p < 0.05). However, MF was not as effective as LNF and RF in inhibiting the formation of TBARS and TVBN. In conclusion, LNF played a more positive role in quality retention of freshwater fish.",10.1016/j.lwt.2023.115520

Based on systematically investigating soybean aphid populations in the field from 2018 to 2020, this study adopted the inverse logistic model for the first time, and combined it with the classical logistic model to describe the changes in seasonal population abundance from colonization to extinction in the field. Then, the increasing and decreasing phases of the population fluctuation were divided by calculating the inflection points of the models, which exhibited distinct seasonal trends of the soybean aphid populations in each year. In addition, multifactor logistic models were then established for the first time, in which the abundance of soybean aphids in the field changed with time and relevant environmental conditions. This model enabled the prediction of instantaneous aphid abundance at a given time based on relevant meteorological data. Taken as a whole, the successful approaches implemented in this study could be used to build a theoretical framework for practical IPM strategies for controlling soybean aphids.",10.1016/j.jia.2023.02.021

Two novel fucoidans named ANP-6 and ANP-7 and found in A. nodosum, were separated and purified and their structures were elucidated by HPGPC, HPLC, GC-MS, FT-IR, NMR, and by the Congo red test. They both possessed a backbone constructed of -> 2)-alpha-L-Fucp4S-(1 ->, -> 3)-alpha-L-Fucp2S4S-(1 ->, -> 6)-beta-D-Galp-(1 ->, and -> 3,6)-beta-D-Galp4S-(1 -> with branches of -> 2)-alpha-L-Fucp4S-(1 -> and -> 3)-beta-D-Galp-(1 ->. Moreover, ANP-6 and ANP-7 could prevent the inflammation of the LPS-stimulated macrophages by suppressing the NO production and by regulating the expressions of iNOS, COX-2, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-10. Their inhibitory effects on the TLR-2 and TLR-4 levels suggest that they inhibit the inflammation process via the blocking of the TLR/NF-kappa B signal transduction. In addition, ANP-6, with a molecular weight (63.2 kDa), exhibited stronger anti-inflammatory capabilities than ANP-7 (124.5 kDa), thereby indicating that the molecular weight has an influence on the anti-inflammatory effects of fucoidans.",10.3390/foods11152381

A total of 149 haplotypes were identified from 358 individuals from the four wild and two hatchery populations with 109 substitutions. The genetic diversity of the wild populations and Geoje hatchery population were high, whereas the total number of haplotypes, population-specific haplotypes, and haplotype diversity were comparatively low in the Goheung hatchery population. The fixation index (F-ST) indicated that there was no significant genetic difference between the four wild populations. However, the Goheung hatchery population was significantly different from that of the Geoje hatchery, exhibiting the most pronounced difference, and two wild populations (Jinhae and Yeosu). The low genetic diversity indices exhibited by the Goheung hatchery population might have resulted from farm propagation using a limited parental stock.

A possible mechanistic link may therefore exist between the Haploops colonies and the shallow pockmarks. To test this hypothesis, interferometry sonar and sub-bottom profiler chirp data were acquired in two new areas located in the marine estuary of the Loire River, La Lambarde and Le Croisic. The new sites share the same sedimentary and geological characteristics as those found in the Bay of Concarneau. The three sites are similarly located in shallow and muddy environments above a faulted Middle Eocene formation that is incised by paleo-valleys. Despite different hydrodynamic conditions and estuarine influence, in the two new investigated areas, the Haploops also settle within the pockmarks field limits. To better constrain the association pockmarks/Haploops, we compared the sedimentary features, seismic signatures and total organic carbon (TOC) content of the sediment. Active pockmark chimneys displaying highly reworked profiles and slightly higher TOC contents suggest a local deeper source of organic matter, which might be an important source of nutrient for the Haploops. In Southern Brittany the pockmarks/Haploops spatial overlap is not a simple coincidence and may therefore present a general pattern for identification of settlement preferences of the specie.",10.1016/j.margeo.2019.105961

The QN Orange scallop, a new scallop strain successively selected from the interspecific hybrids of the bay scallop (Argopecten irradians irradians) and the Peruvian scallop (Argopecten purpuratus), is distinguished from other scallops by its orange adductor muscles. In this study, to reveal the mechanisms of the formation of adductor muscle coloration in the QN Orange scallops, we compared the proteome and transcriptome of orange adductor muscles of the QN Orange and those of white adductor muscles of the Bohai Red scallop, another strain selected from the interspecific hybrids of the bay scallop and the Peruvian scallop.ResultsTranscriptomic analysis revealed 416 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between white and orange adductor muscles, among which 216 were upregulated and 200 were downregulated. Seventy-four differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), including 36 upregulated and 38 downregulated proteins, were identified through label-free proteomics. Among the identified DEGs and DEPs, genes related to carotenoids biosynthesis including apolipophorin, and Cytochrome P450 and those related to melanin biosynthesis including tyrosinase and Ras-related protein Rab-11A were found to express at higher levels in orange adductor muscles. The high expression levels of VPS (vacuolar protein sorting) and TIF (translation initiation factor) in orange adductor muscle tissues indicated that carotenoid accumulation may be affected by proteins outside of the carotenoid pathway.ConclusionsOur results implied that the coloration of orange adductor muscles in the QN Orange scallops may be controlled by genes modulating accumulation of carotenoids and melanins. This study may provide valuable information for understanding the mechanisms and pathways underlying adductor muscle coloration in molluscan shellfish.",10.1186/s12864-019-5717-y

This polychaete proved to be a threat to local diversity as it displaced native species and modified the natural intertidal community structure. However, nothing is known about its latitudinal distribution in the country and the degree of its invasion. It is possible that due to deficiencies in taxonomy and lack of ecological studies, other localities of the Argentine coast were also invaded by this polychaete but have not yet been registered. The goal of the present study was to survey the latitudinal distribution of B. proboscidea in the coastal area of Argentina from 37 degrees S to 54 degrees S. In addition, this study aimed to evaluate the type of substrate colonized, investigate the presence of sewage effluence as a conditional factor for B. proboscidea establishment, and evaluate differences in the composition of species assemblages associated with the intertidal community invaded by the polychaete. Boccardia proboscidea was found latitudinally from 37 degrees S to 47 degrees S. The highest abundance was found on hard substrates and with intertidal sewage effluent. The opportunistic nature (r strategy) of B. proboscidea coupled with a continuous supply of organic matter (sewage effluent) may indicate the mechanism that has led to the success of its introduction into new localities.",10.3391/ai.2018.13.3.04

Granular and agranular epithelial cells, hyalinocytes, and fibroblast-like cells were observed in the initial stages of culture. Epithelial cells later formed pseudopodial cell networks containing clusters of granulated cells, which upon maturation released their colored granules. These granules induced formation of nacre crystal deposits on the bottom of the culture plate. Cultures comprised of only granulated epithelial cells were established through periodic sub-culturing of mantle cells and maintained for over 18 mo in a viable condition. Reverse transcriptase PCR of cultured cells demonstrated gene expression of the shell matrix protein, nacrein. To further evaluate the functional ability of cultured granulated epithelial cells, nuclear shell beads were incubated in culture medium containing these cells to induce nacre formation on the beads. Observation of the bead surface under a stereomicroscope at periodic intervals showed the gradual formation of blackish yellow colored nacre deposits. Examination of the bead surface by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis at periodic intervals revealed a distinct brick and mortar formation characteristic of nacre, comprised of aragonite platelets and matrix proteins. Calcium, carbon, and oxygen were the major elements in all stages examined. Our study shows that mantle epithelial cells in culture retain the ability to secrete nacre and can therefore form the basis for future studies on the biomineralization process and its application in development of sustainable pearl culture.",10.1007/s11626-018-0269-z

The most resolved molecular phylogenetic study to date at the family level in Vetigastropoda was based on molecular data of complete mitochondrial genomes, but only 15 mitochondrial genomes are available and the taxonomic coverage remains insufficient to resolve many systematic questions. Notably, among the vetigastropod superfamilies, 'Trochoidea' is the most diverse, but no mitogenome has been yet published for its representative family Trochidae. We here provided eight newly reconstructed mitogenomes from the following vetigastropods: Angaria delphinus, Phasianella australis, Astralium haematragum, Lunella granulata, Chlorostoma argyrostomum, Omphalius nigerrimus, Stomatella planulata and Variegemarginula punctata. Stomatella planulata is the first available mitogenome for Trochidae. Our analyses of the extended mitogenome dataset show that the two trochoid families Turbinidae and Tegulidae group together, while their relationship to Trochidae (represented by S. planulata) is uncertain. Within the Tegulidae, monophyly of the genus Tegula is not recovered. The analysis with additional fissurelloid mitogenome confirms that within Vetigastropoda this superfamily is a distinct clade. Except for V. punctata the mitogenomes reconstructed show the ancestral gene order for Vetigastropoda. The additional fissurelloid mitogenome reveals that gene order in Fissurelloidea is variable, which might suggest a faster rate of mitochondrial evolution that in turn may cause artefacts in phylogenetic analyses.",10.1093/mollus/eyw027

Methods: Partial sequences of the 28S rRNA gene of 40 specimens representing 25 dactylogyrid species were analysed together with sequences from GenBank using Bayesian inference, Maximum likelihood and Parsimony methods. Monophyly of dactylogyrids infecting catfishes and the Ancyrocephalinae was evaluated using the Approximately Unbiased test. Results: The Ancyrocephalinae is a paraphyletic group of species clustering in three main clades as follows: (i) clade A comprising freshwater dactylogyrids from the Holarctic parasitising perciforms clustering together with species (Ameloblastella, Unibarra and Vancleaveus) parasitising Neotropical catfishes; (ii) clade B including species of Dactylogyrus (Dactylogyrinae) and Pseudodactylogyrus (Pseudodactylogyrinae) along with Ancyrocephalus mogurndae, and marine dactylogyrids with cosmopolitan distribution, parasites of scorpaeniforms and perciforms, along with the freshwater Cichlidogyrus and Scutogyrus (infecting African cichlids [Cichlidae]) and (iii) clade C containing exclusively dactylogyrids of siluriforms, freshwater and marine, with Palaearctic, Ethiopian, Oriental and Neotropical distributions; species of Aphanoblastella and Dactylogyridae gen. sp. 4 from the Neotropical region clustering together with species allocated in the Ancylodiscoidinae, along with species of Cosmetocleithrum, Demidospermus and Dactylogyridae gen. spp. Conclusions: The position of the Ancylodiscoidinae within a larger clade of dactylogyrids (ancyrocephalines) indicates that this subfamily does not represent a natural group. Instead, species allocated to this clade (dactylogyrids of siluriforms along with species of the Ancylodiscoidinae) should be considered as a separate subfamily within the Dactylogyridae. The erection of this taxon requires the search for morphological diagnostic characters in addition to phylogenetic information. A similar strategy should be considered for a new classification of the paraphyletic Ancyrocephalinae. Members of the three clades do not seem to share obvious morphological synapomorphies nor clear patterns in host-parasite associations, zoogeographical distribution or ecology. Clade A should be considered as the Ancyrocephalinae sensu stricto since it includes the type species Ancyrocephalus paradoxus Creplin, 1839. A new subfamily should be proposed to accommodate species currently allocated to Ancyrocephalinae clustering within clade B.

Average concentration of Ca was 36 g/kg in all Ca sources (except CS and LS). Calcium content was 20.35 and 20.32% in CS and LS, respectively. The mineral composition analysis showed values of P varying from 0.03 to 1.8%, Mg from 0.01 to 1.2%, K from 0.005 to 0.32%, Na from 0.02 to 0.81%, Mn from 7.22 to 2168 mg/kg, Zn from 23.8 to 120.5 mg/kg, Fe from 0 to 37.9 mg/kg, Cu from 10.4 to 41 mg/kg, and boron from 0 to 163 mg/kg. There was significant interaction (P < 0.05) between Ca sources and time for solubility for different particle size of Ca sources. In vitro solubility was dependent upon Ca source and particle size (P < 0.0001) with small particle generally having a greater in vitro solubility than large particle at the same time. The in vitro solubility rate of these Ca sources would provide a new and adequate source of Ca and a steady rate of Ca during the dark period. It was concluded that the observed mineral concentration and in vitro solubility differences between the examined Ca sources could be exploited to ensure optimum supply of Ca and most minerals, but lower in vitro solubility and Ca content of CS and LS would likely limit the use of CS and LS.",10.3382/japr.2013-00752

We evaluated geographic variation in interactions between most extant native populations of Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) and the associated resistant-propagule community (RPC) of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi, using a reciprocal cross-inoculation experiment with all factorial combinations of plant genotypes and soils with fungal guilds from each population. Our results suggest that the pine populations have diverged in community composition of their RPC fungi, and have also diverged genetically in several traits related to interactions of seedlings with particular EM fungi, growth, and biomass allocation. Patterns of genetic variation among pine populations for compatibility with EM fungi differed for the three dominant species of EM fungi, suggesting that Monterey pines can evolve differently in their compatibility with different symbiont species.",10.1890/11-1715.1

In spite of numerous researches, the shell protein content of a limited number of model species has been investigated. This paper presents biochemical data on the common edible land snail Helix aspersa maxima, a model organism for ecotoxicological purposes, which has however been poorly investigated from a biomineralization viewpoint. The shell matrix of this species was extracted and analyzed biochemically for functional in vitro inhibition assay, for amino acid and monosaccharides compositions. The matrix was further analyzed on 1 and 2D gels and short partial protein sequences were obtained from 2D gel spots. Serological comparisons were established with a set of heterologous antibodies, two of which were subsequently used for subsequent immunogold localization of matrix components. Our data suggest that the shell matrix of Helix aspersa maxima may differ widely from the shell secretory repertoire of the marine mollusks studied so far, such as the gastropod Halioris or the pearl oyster Pinctada. In particular, most of the biochemical properties generally attributed to soluble shell matrices, such as calcium-binding capability, or the capacity to interfere in vitro with the precipitation of calcium carbonate or to inhibit the precipitation of calcium carbonate, were not recorded with this matrix. This drastic change in the biochemical properties of the landsnail shell matrix puts into question the existence of a unique molecular model for molluscan shell formation, and may be related to terrestrialisation.

Among the wide diversity of mollusc shell textures, nacro-prismatic shells represent a tremendous opportunity for the investigation of the SMP evolution. Indeed, nacro-prismatic texture appears early in Cambrian molluscs and is still present in the shell of some bivalves, gastropods, cephalopods and very likely also, of some monoplacophorans. One key question is to know whether these shells are constructed from similar matrix protein assemblages, i.e. whether they share a common origin. Most of the molecular data published so far are restricted to two genera, the bivalve Pinctada and the gastropod Haliotis. The shell protein content of these two genera are clearly different, suggesting independent origins or considerable genetic drift from a common ancestor. In order to describe putatively conserved mollusc shell proteins, here we have investigated the SMP set of a new bivalve model belonging to another genera, the edible mussel Mytilus, using an up-to-date proteomic approach based on the interrogation of more than 70,000 EST sequences, recently available from NCBI public databases. We describe nine novel SMPs, among which three are completely novel, four are homologues of Pinctada SMPs and two are very likely homologues of Haliotis SMPs. This latter result constitutes the first report of conserved SMPs between bivalves and gastropods. More generally, our data suggest that mollusc SMP set may follow a mosaic pattern within the different mollusc models (Mytilus, Pinctada, Haliotis). We discuss the function of such proteins in calcifying matrices, the molecular evolution of SMP genes and the origin of mollusc nacro-prismatic SMPs.",10.1007/s00239-011-9451-6

We describe here the structure of the hemocyanin Helix lucorum (H1H), species in the series of molluscan hemocyanins. In contrast with other molluscan hemocyanins, three different hemocyanin isopolypeptides were isolated from the hemolymph of the garden snail H. lucorum, named as beta-H1H, alpha(D)-H1H and alpha(N)-H1H. Their molecular masses were determined by size exclusion chromatography to be 1068 kDa (beta-H1H) and 1079 kDa (alpha(D)-H1H, and alpha(N)-H1H). Native H1H exhibits a predominant didecameric structure as revealed by electron microscopy and additionally few tridecamers are shown in the electron micrographs of H1H resulting from the association of a further decamer with one didecamer. The three isoforms are represented mainly as homogeneous didecamers, but they have different behaviour after dissociation and reassociation in the pH-stabilizing buffer, containing 20 mM CaCl2. All isoforms were reassociated into didecamers and tubules with different length, but in contrast to alpha(D)-H1H isoform, longer tubules were observed in beta-H1H.

In the presence of different concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions and pH values, the subunits differ not only in their reassociation behaviour, but also in their formation of helical tubules and multidecamers. RvH1 revealed a greater stability at higher pH values compared to RvH2. Overall, the stability of reassociated RvH and its structural subunits was found to be pH-dependent. The increasing stability of native Hc and its subunits, shown by pH-induced CD transitions (acid and alkaline denaturation), can be explained with the formation of quaternary structure. The absence of a Cotton effect at temperatures 20-40 degrees C in the pH-transition curves of RvH2 indicates that this subunit is stabilized by additional factors, e.g.: non-ionic/hydrophobic stabilization and interactions of carbohydrate moieties. A similar behaviour was observed for the T-transition curves in a wide pH interval for RvH and its structural subunits. At higher temperatures, many of the secondary structural elements are preserved especially at neutral pH, even at extreme high temperatures above 90 degrees C the protein structures resemble a globule state.

"Davies, MS; Hatcher, AM",The energy budget: a useful tool?,1998,ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI,35,4,231,240,,"Studies of energy flow and allocation in biological systems often result in the production of energy budgets. Our aim is to describe the potential mis-representations that energy budgets can produce and draw together the various criticisms levied at energy budgets. While such budgets purport to represent accurately energy allocation we, by discussing the literature, propose that many offer little. This is because in practice they rarely reflect actual energy relationships due to problems with their empirical derivation. These problems include both the omission of some energy budget terms (such as dissolved organic matter, non-lethal predation and metabolic faecal loss) and their underestimation (e.g. mucus production). Recalculation of budgets to account for these terms often results in new conclusions being drawn. Moreover, problems of extrapolation of measurements made in the laboratory to the field, coupled with misconceptions over the expression of temporal and spatial variation in budget terms, produce budgets that are both approximate and specific to an individual or population at the time each budget is constructed. In addition, the set of assumptions that are used in the construction of one budget are rarely the same as those for another and so budgets should be used with extreme care in comparative studies. We suggest that energy budgets have little value in the context of other studies and are of interest and value only as descriptors under a set of what should be well-defined assumptions. We urge caution in their use and propose that more modest studies of energy allocation with precise goals are more appropriate.",

To test this hypothesis, we compared the population genetic structure of P. hoplura to that of Boccardia polybranchia since both species have similar larval developmental modes (and consequently natural dispersal potential) and distribution ranges in southern Africa. However, since B. polybranchia is not a pest, its population structure should reflect the effects of only biogeographic barriers on natural dispersal. Boccardia polybranchia was collected from five wild sites along the South African coast, and P. hoplura from seven wild sites and four oyster farms; two each were on-shore and off-shore. Analyses of mtDNA Cyt b sequence data indicate two distinct lineages for B. polybranchia, supporting Cape Point as a biogeographic barrier to the dispersal of larvae. In contrast, no distinct geographic lineages were identified for P. hoplura occurring in the wild, and haplotype sharing suggest possible cross infestation between farm and nearby wild sites. At farms the genetic diversity of P. hoplura is lower but also more structured, suggesting separate anthropogenic introductions at each site possibly from genetically distinct source populations. Furthermore, more limited genetic sharing was detected between worms from on-shore and nearby wild sites, whereas the opposite was observed for off-shore farms and associated wild sites. This suggests that populations in on-shore farms are more contained with most of the individuals carrying parasites corresponding to the source of introduction while those on off-shore farms display much more genetic exchange with wild populations. Thus oysters in off-shore facilities are probably more vulnerable to infestation by polydorid pests than are those in on-shore facilities.

The EPC is defined as a substantial thickening of both the spire callus and the callus on the ventral shell surface such that it covers 50% or more of the surface. Caenogastropods as a whole construct the EPC convergently, using a variety of low-density, poorly organized microstructures that are otherwise uncommon in caenogastropod non-callus shell construction. Within clades, however, we see evidence for parallelism in decreased regulation in both the shell and callus microstructure. Low-density and poorly ordered microstructure-such as used for the EPC-uses less organic scaffolding and is less energetically expensive than normal shell microstructure. This suggests the EPC functions to rapidly and inexpensively increase shell thickness and overall body size. Tests of functional ecology suggest that the EPC might function both to defend against crushing predation through increased body size and dissipation of forces while aiding in shell orientation of highly mobile gastropods. These interpretations hinge on the current phylogenetic placement of caenogastropod families, emphasizing the essential contribution of phylogeny when interpreting homoplasy.",10.1017/pab.2020.33

We categorized them into type Ⅰ (vtg1,4,5 and 6), type Ⅱ (vtg2) and type Ⅲ (vtg3) based on differences in their subdomain structure. The promoter sequence of vtgs has multiple estrogen response elements, and their abundance appears to correlate with the responsiveness of vtg gene expression to estrogen. Gene expression analyses revealed that the vitellogenesis of Sichuan bream involves both heterosynthesis and autosynthesis pathways, with the dominant pathway originating from the liver. The drug treatment experiments revealed that 17β-estradiol (E2) tightly regulated the level of vtg mRNA in the liver. Feeding fish with a diet containing 100 μg/g E2 for three weeks significantly induced vtg gene expression and ovarian development, leading to an earlier onset of vitellogenesis. Additionally, it was observed that the initiation of vtg transcription required E2 binding to its receptor, a process primarily mediated by estrogen receptor alpha in Sichuan bream. The findings of this study provide novel insights into the molecular information of the vitellogenin gene family in teleosts, thereby contributing to the regulation of gonadal development in farmed fish. © 2024 by the authors.",10.3390/ijms25126739

Sludge has been proposed as a feed stock for polychaete production, which in turn can be utilized live in shrimp aquaculture or as an aquafeed ingredient. However, the biosafety of such value chains has not yet been addressed. We conducted an experiment exposing the polychaete Hediste diversicolor to aquaculture sludge spiked with four different fish pathogens (Mycobacterium salmoniphilum, Yersinia ruckeri, Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis (IPN) and Infectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA)) known to cause diseases in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Moreover, we assessed whether heavy metals and other potentially hazardous elements present in fish sludge bioaccumulates in the polychaetes. Neither of the bacteria nor viruses could be detected in the polychaetes after 14 days of continuous exposure. Seven of the 15 elements we analysed showed bioaccumulation factors significantly below one, meaning biodilution, while the other eight did not differ from one, meaning no bioaccumulation. None of the elements showed a significant bioaccumulation. Further on, none of the heavy metals found in the polychaetes at the end of our experiment exceeded the EU regulatory maximum levels for fish feed ingredients. The current results suggest that a H. diversicolor can reared on aquaculture sludge, and aquaculture sludge may serve as feed stock for polychaete production without the product exceeding EU regulations for contaminants in animal feed. © 2024",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.122073

The use of abalone interspecific hybrids is gaining attention due to their improved growth and tolerance to environmental challenges. However, hybrids may respond differently to dietary inputs compared to their parental species, which could be optimized to achieve maximum growth potential. Accordingly, we previously reported that the postlarvae of a hybrid cross obtained by mating red and green abalone (H. rufescens [♀] x H. fulgens [♂]) presented higher growth and survival rates than red abalone postlarvae when fed with Macrocystis pyrifera (M) and a mixture of Ulva onhoi and Navicula incerta (UN). Here, to gain a deeper insight into the physiological and metabolic responses of both crosses, we report the results of a transcriptome sequencing analysis to unveil the diet-driven physiological changes within each cross. Our findings indicate that the diet induces modulation in the transcriptional machinery related to macromolecules breakdown, especially, the mixed diet UN induced higher expression of lysosomal enzymes, especially in enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan catabolism, such as arylsulfatases, glucosidases, and alpha-fucosidases, which might indicate a higher ability to break down complex carbohydrates from algae. These transcriptional responses might explain the growth difference between pure and hybrid as well as for abalone fed with M and UN. © 2025",10.1016/j.cbd.2025.101484

This two-part experiment aimed to investigate first (i) the dose effect of replacing soy protein concentrate with SCP in Australian hybrid abalone diets (Haliotis laevigata Haliotis rubra) and second, (ii) the potential for improved palatability of the SCP by using commercially produced liquid protein hydrolysate (PH). This was assessed in a 2 × 2 factorial experimental design. The diets were formulated to be iso-proteic (~40% crude protein as fed) and iso-energetic (~18 MJ kg−1 as fed). The diets (SCP 0%, SCP 5%, SCP 10%, SCP 20%, SCP 0% + PH, and SCP 20% + PH) were fed to the abalone (~9.25 g initial weight) once daily in the evening for 94 days to apparent satiation. The growth performance and feed utilization of abalone fed with up to 10% SCP was comparable to the control; however, there was a significant reduction in most parameters at the highest inclusion of 20%. In the second experiment, there was a decline in measured protein and energy retention in the abalone fed 20% SCP, with a concomitantly lower apparent biological value. Positively, there were significant improvements in the apparent digestibility of the diet at the 20% SCP inclusion. There was no significant impact of using the PH on growth performance or feed intake. No effects were observed on the digestive enzyme activity (α-amylase, lipase, and trypsin) examined among the treatments. Considering these results collectively, the maximum recommended inclusion of methanotrophic SCP meal should be 10% for hybrid abalone. Reasons for the decline in performance at the highest inclusion may be related to palatability; however, this remains to be fully confirmed. Copyright © 2025 Michael J. Salini et al.

It also evaluated a mark in the shell detected after transferring abalone from the hatchery to the ocean as a predictor of the size-at-release for the abalone. The research was carried out as part of commercial operations on the sea ranch which limited some of the data collected. A total of 117 tagged H. laevigata were released on the Abitats and harvested across three areas (lines). Growth in shell length (SL) was significantly slower on one line (1.96 mm month-1) than the others (2.33 mm month-1 and 2.44 mm month-1), possibly due to different pre-seeding histories. Slower growing abalone were retained in the hatchery for an additional 74 days compared to the faster growing abalone. However, growth in wet weight did not differ significantly among lines (2.22 g month-1). This study provides the first estimates of the different shell-length characteristics for juvenile abalone: the mean (± 1 SE) SL: shell width ratio was 1.31 ± 0.005 and the SL: shell depth ratio was 4.94 ± 0.057, much greater than these ratios for mature H. rubra in southern Australia. The hatchery mark at harvest was a significant linear predictor of the shell length at seeding and was still present in abalone at harvest size (~100 mm SL), providing a way of estimating growth in H. laevigata on the sea ranch without the need for tagging. © Asian Fisheries Society.",10.33997/j.afs.2025.38.1.002

In this study, AS-stabilized and reinforced carboxymethyl chitosan/collagen/PLGA porous bionic composite scaffolds (AS/CMCS/Col/PLGA) were fabricated through the emulsion polymerization and bionic hybrid technology. As the addition of AS increased from 0.75 to 3.0 wt%, homogeneous distribution of flower-like particles could be observed on the inner surface of the scaffold, and its mechanical properties were improved. Particularly, 3.0 wt% AS-doped scaffolds (S3 and C + S3) exhibited excellent inorganic mineral deposition and osteoblast proliferation and differentiation abilities in vitro. In a SD rat calvarial defect model, they effectively promoted new bone formation in the defect and accelerated expression of osteogenic-angiogenic related proteins (COLI, OCN, VEGF).

Results: We developed a multiplex quantitative real-time PCR assay that can accurately detect all genera of Francisellaceae, including Francisella, Francisella-like endosymbionts, Allofrancisella, Parafrancisella and Pseudofrancisella. In addition, we developed a qPCR assay to differentiate the major clades (B.4, B.6 and B.12 [B.71 and B.72]) of F. tularensis ssp. holarctica strains. Both primer sets were shown to work on isolated DNA out of human and tick samples. Conclusion: Since the developed qPCRs are able to detect all genera of Francisellaceae tested, an easy and fast identification of opportunistic Francisella strains causing tularemia-like symptoms in humans or animals is possible now. The application of these qPCR assays will thus improve the capability for clinical diagnostics and molecular typing during epidemiological investigations. © The Author(s) 2025.",10.1186/s12866-025-03751-9

Superior hybrids are widely utilized in aquaculture with large benefits. As a typical example, interspecific hybrid “Lvpan” abalone (Haliotis discus hannai ♀ × H. fulgens ♂) also has excellent growth performance, as well as advantaged thermal tolerance. Nevertheless, the mechanisms responsible for this growth heterosis in “Lvpan” hybrid abalone have remained elusive. In this study, a two-month thermostatic acclimation experiment was conducted for “Lvpan” abalone and its parental species at three temperatures (14, 18, and 24 °C). The results showed that the interspecific hybrid ‘Lvpan’ abalone exhibited significant growth heterosis when compared to its parental species, especially at high temperatures. Transcriptome dynamics in the foot muscles of abalones also unveiled that most genes expression patterns represented to be maternal-biased, which are involved in growth-related process. It indicated that maternal effects on gene expression in hybrid abalones play can play an important role in growth heterosis. Moreover, we observed that most genes expressed non-additively in the hybrid abalone are involved in the regulation of growth and cell differentiation during development, which play pivotal roles in the formation of growth heterosis. Consequently, we have provided new insights into abalone interspecific heterosis, emphasizing the pivotal role that non-additive gene expression plays in generating heterosis through cross-breeding. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.741657

Due to their potential to flocculate and deposit when interacting with high ionic strength media, GO poses a threat, especially to benthic organisms like polychaetes. In addition to chemical contamination, estuaries also face a severe threat from invasive species, which can cause irreversible damage to ecosystems. The combination of abiotic and biotic stressors may work together on native species, decreasing their resilience. Thus, this study aims to assess the effects of an abiotic stressor, GO nanosheets (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 mg GO/Kg dw) on Hediste diversicolor (native species) and Arenicola marina (invasive species) through several behavioral assays and biochemical markers. The impact of invasive species A. marina (biotic factor) on H. diversicolor avoidance behavior was also evaluated. Obtained results demonstrated that H. diversicolor fled from lower GO contamination compartments to higher ones and that exposure to increased GO concentrations negatively impacted its burrowing activity. They were unable to escape from higher contamination compartments, but at the highest concentrations, the bioturbation activity was significantly higher, which may indicate that H. diversicolor tended to dwell deeper in the sediment. A. marina showed an escape behavior from compartments with higher GO concentrations. Additionally, this species' bioturbation activity significantly decreased when exposed to GO. Moreover, avoidance tests demonstrated that the presence of A. marina affected the behavior of H. diversicolor. Regarding oxidative stress, H. diversicolor seems to be more impacted than A. marina, since Lipid peroxidation levels were higher in all GO concentrations and Superoxide dismutase activity significantly increased in the lowest GO levels. Overall, H. diversicolor spatial distribution may be severely constrained under abiotic and biotic stress, while A. marina's higher foraging activity may promote its propagation in the estuary. Behavioral tests, combined with biochemical markers have shown to be relevant tools for the development of more environmental-realistic assessment and monitoring frameworks for estuaries. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.marenvres.2024.106821

Subtidal, adult pāua experience irregular food supply. The effects of prolonged starvation have not been examined. Aim. To examine effects of 105-day starvation on body mass, respiration and haemolymph proteins. Methods. Pāua, maintained at 15°C, were divided into groups that were either fed Macrocystis pyrifera, or starved; each group was further divided between pāua whose haemolymph was sampled at intervals and those sampled only at the beginning and end of the experimental period. Body mass, condition, oxygen uptake and gonad index were measured at the start and end. Key results. Total mass of both fed and starved groups did not change significantly. The condition of the starved individuals decreased significantly. Haemocyanin accounts almost entirely for haemolymph proteins. The haemolymph haemocyanin concentration in fed abalone fell by 17–27% over 105 days, and by 49–63% in starved individuals. Final normoxic oxygen uptake was similar in starved and fed pāua and declined similarly during hypoxia. Conclusions. Pāua may survive extended periods of starvation by metabolising body tissues and haemocyanin, with only minor changes in their mass, condition and aerobic respiration. Implications. These primitive gastropods have mechanisms to survive stressors associated with low food availability. Maintenance of body volume in this osmoconformer supports gill perfusion and the functioning of the hydraulic skeleton in locomotion. © 2025 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).",10.1071/MF24147

The Puget Sound Restoration Fund, in collaboration with state and federal agencies, has been outplanting juvenile pinto abalone at sites in the San Juan Archipelago, and some sites are much more successful than others despite similar physical characteristics. The sites, however, likely differ in oceanic parameters, such as temperature, salinity, and pH, which are in turn changing as the climate of the Earth is changing. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of temperature fluctuation and pCO2levels on the survival, growth, and oxygen consumption of juvenile pinto abalone. In a fully crossed experiment, juvenile pinto abalone were held at either currently ambient (400 ppm) or elevated (1,200 ppm) pCO2and at constant (10°C) or fluctuating (10 → 14 → 10°C) temperature. Survival was monitored weekly and growth was measured after 4 wk. In a second experiment, abalone were held in the same crossed pCO2and temperature treatments, and oxygen consumption was measured. High pCO2and fluctuating temperature both significantly decreased abalone survival. Abalone growth was not affected by pCO2level (temperature could not be analyzed due to very poor survival in the fluctuating temperature treatments). In addition, there was an interaction between fluctuating temperature and pCO2level on abalone oxygen consumption. Abalone in the constant temperature treatment had higher oxygen consumption when exposed to elevated pCO2; however, this pattern was not observed in the fluctuating temperature treatment. The results of this experiment indicate that outplant sites with minimal temperature fluctuation and lower pCO2levels could lead to improvements in outplanting success of juvenile pinto abalone. © 2024 National Shellfisheries Association.

Abalone requires bacterial extracellular enzymes to aid the digestive process by breaking down complex macromolecules. This study aims to determine the ability of Bacillus from abalone to hydrolyze complex macromolecules, antibacterial activities against pathogenic Vibrios and to select Bacillus that has the potential as a probiotic candidate. Test the ability of Bacillus to hydrolyze several complex compounds such as agar, fat,protein, and starch using SWC agar media which has been enriched by the substrate to be hydrolyzed. Hydrolysis test data were obtained from 2 methods, namely by observing the clear zone using cell culture and the clear zone formed from the cell-free supernatant containing the crude extract of the enzyme. The clear zone formed becomes an indicator of Bacillus capable of hydrolyzing complex compounds. The datawere analyzed descriptively through a semi-quantitative potency test. Test the ability of Bacillus isolates in inhibiting the growth of Vibrio sp. carried out by the well-diffusion method.The results showed that Bacillus SL1K1 was the best at hydrolyzing starch and agar with a starch hydrolysis index of 2.25 and a agar hydrolysis index of 4.73. Isolate Bacillus SL2K2 was the best at hydrolyzing lipids with a lipid hydrolysis index of 1.27, isolate Bacillus CA2K6 was the best at hydrolyzing proteins with a proteinhydrolysis index of 3.13. The enzymatic ability of Bacillus based on the clear zone formed showed that Bacillus SL1K1 isolate was the best at hydrolyzing agar-agar and starch. The antibacterial test results of the four isolates of Bacillus against Vibrio bacteria showed that the isolate of Bacillus CAK1 against Vibrio parahaemolyticus had the highest activity with an average inhibition zone of 14.5 mm. Thus, both Bacillus SLK1 and CAK1 isolates have the potential to be used as probiotic candidates. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.",10.1063/5.0212008

In Pacific oysters, the inheritance patterns of several shell colors have been investigated, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms of melanogenesis and pigmentation. cAMP-response element binding proteins (CREB) are important transcription factors in the cAMP-mediated melanogenesis pathway. In this study, we characterized two CREB genes (CREB3L2 and CREB3L3) from Pacific oysters. Both of them contained a conserved DNA-binding and dimerization domain (a basic-leucine zipper domain). CREB3L2 and CREB3L3 were expressed highly in the mantle tissues and exhibited higher expression levels in the black-shell oyster than in the white. Masson-Fontana melanin staining and immunofluorescence analysis showed that the location of CREB3L2 protein was generally consistent with the distribution of melanin in oyster edge mantle. Dual-luciferase reporter assays revealed that CREB3L2 and CREB3L3 could activate the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) promoter and this process was regulated by the level of cAMP. Additionally, we found that cAMP regulated melanogenic gene expression through the CREB-MITF-TYR axis. These results implied that CREB3L2 and CREB3L3 play important roles in melanin synthesis and pigmentation in Pacific oysters. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.cbpb.2024.110970

However, there is very limited research on Elovl in abalone. In this study, an elongase gene encoding 303 amino acids was found to exhibit higher homology with the Elovl2/5 sequences of mollusks (60 %) than the Elovl5 of fish and mammals (about 43.30 %). Heterologous expression in yeast showed that abalone Elovl could efficiently catalyze the extension of C18:3n-3, C18:3n-6 and C18:4n-3, moderately elongate C18:2n-6, C20:4n-6 and C20:5n-3 to corresponding products. However, it has extremely weak ability to extend C20:3n-6 and C20:4n-3 and no affinity for C22 PUFA. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the sequence of abalone Elovl is closely related to Elovl2/5 of the cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) and octopus (Octopus vulgaris). Tissue distribution revealed that the Elovl was highly expressed in female and male gonads, moderately in hepatopancreas, and minimally in other tested tissues. The expression levels of Elovl in hepatopancreas of abalone fed 50 % FO and 75 % FO diets were significantly higher than that in the 100 % FO control group. And no significant differences were found in the expressions of 0 % FO, 25 % FO and control groups. The EPA in 75 % FO group is significantly higher than those of other groups.

Tuberculata Chang (Camellia L.): genomic features, comparative analysis, and phylogenetic relationships",2024,BMC Genomics,25,1,,,108,"Background: Sect. Tuberculata belongs to Camellia, and its members are characterized by a wrinkled pericarp and united filaments. All the plants in this group, which are endemic to China, are highly valuable for exploring the evolution of Camellia and have great potential for use as an oil source. However, due to the complex and diverse phenotypes of these species and the difficulty of investigating them in the field, their complex evolutionary history and interspecific definitions have remained largely unelucidated. Results: Therefore, we newly sequenced and annotated 12 chloroplast (cp) genomes and retrieved the published cp genome of Camellia anlungensis Chang in sect. Tuberculata. In this study, comparative analysis of the cp genomes of the thirteen sect. Tuberculata species revealed a typical quadripartite structure characterized by a total sequence length ranging from 156,587 bp to 157,068 bp. The cp.genome arrangement is highly conserved and moderately differentiated. A total of 130 to 136 genes specific to the three types were identified by annotation, including protein-coding genes (coding sequences (CDSs)) (87–91), tRNA genes (35–37), and rRNA genes (8). The total observed frequency ranged from 23,045 (C. lipingensis) to 26,557 (C. anlungensis). IR region boundaries were analyzed to show that the ycf1 gene of C. anlungensis is located in the IRb region, while the remaining species are present only in the IRa region. Sequence variation in the SSC region is greater than that in the IR region, and most protein-coding genes have high codon preferences. Comparative analyses revealed six hotspot regions (tRNA-Thr(GGT)-psbD, psbE-petL, ycf15-tRNA-Leu(CAA), ndhF-rpl32, ndhD, and trnL(CAA)-ycf15) in the cp genomes that could serve as potential molecular markers. In addition, the results of phylogenetic tree construction based on the cp genomes showed that the thirteen sect. Tuberculata species formed a monophyletic group and were divided into two evolutionarily independent clades, confirming the independence of the section. Conclusions: In summary, we obtained the cp genomes of thirteen sect. Tuberculata plants and performed the first comparative analysis of this group. These results will help us better characterize the plants in this section, deepen our understanding of their genetic characteristics and phylogenetic relationships, and lay the theoretical foundation for their accurate classification, elucidation of their evolutionary changes, and rational development and utilization of this section in the future. © 2024, The Author(s).",10.1186/s12864-024-09982-w
Macías-Sánchez E.; Huang X.; Willinger M.G.; Rodríguez-Navarro A.; Checa A.,Organic macromolecules transport a significant proportion of the calcium precursor for nacre formation,2025,Acta Biomaterialia,191,,140,148,,"The mechanism of nacre formation in gastropods involves a vesicular system that transports organic and mineral precursors from the mantle epithelium to the mineralization chamber. Between them lies the surface membrane, a thick organic structure that covers the mineralization chamber and the forming nacre. The surface membrane is a dynamic structure that grows by the addition of vesicles on the outer side and recedes by the formation of interlamellar membranes on the inner side. By using a combination of electron microscopy imaging and spectroscopy, we have monitored the journey of the vesicles from the mantle epithelium to the mineralization chamber, focusing on the elemental composition of the organic structures at each stage. Our data reveal that transport occurs in lipid bilayer vesicles through exocytosis from the outer mantle epithelium. After release into the surface membrane, chitin undergoes a process of self-assembly and interaction with proteins, resulting in progressive changes of the internal structure of the surface membrane until the final structure of the interlamellar membranes is acquired. Finally, these detach from the inner side of the surface membrane. Elemental analysis revealed the transport of a considerable amount of calcium bound to proteins, likely forming calcium-protein complexes. Statement of significance: The formation of nacre tablets occurs through the incorporation of organic and mineral precursors extruded from the mantle epithelium. Although much attention has been paid to the presence of amorphous phases in recent decades, the calcium transport system has not yet been elucidated. We have monitored the packaging of organic and mineral precursors in the form of vesicles from the mantle epithelium to the mineralization chamber. We have shown that the surface membrane represents the zone where chitin and protein polymerization takes place, acquiring the final structure for the formation of interlamellar membranes. Interestingly, these organic structures transport a considerable amount of organic calcium into the mineralization chamber, which support a transport system based on acidic calcium-binding proteins. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.actbio.2024.11.025

In this study, Laminaria digitata fucoidan (LF) was extracted from Laminaria digitata, and purified using DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow gel column to obtain four different grades. Among those, LF4 (Mw:165 kDa), mainly composed of fucose(56.80 %), had the highest total sugar (66.91 %) and sulfate (17.07 %) content. FT-RT and NMR results showed that LF4 was mainly composed of galactosylated galactofucose, and has a sulfate group attached to fucose C4. With the animal experimentation, it was revealed that hyperlipidaemic mice had significantly higher levels of TC (5.52 mmol/L), TG (2.28 mmol/L) and LDL-C (5.12 mmol/L) and significantly lower levels of HDL-C (2 mmol/L). However, LF had the efficacy in modulating the lipid metabolism disturbances induced by hyperlipidemia, as well as the ability to regulate cholesterol transport in serum. Moreover, it regulated AMPK/ACC, PPAR-α/LAXRa, Nrf2/Nqo1, TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway genes and proteins expression in the liver. In addition, it promoted the production of beneficial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) while improving the composition and structure of gut microbiota, including balancing the abundance of Bacteroidota, Firmicutes, Muribaculaceae, Alloprevotella, Escherichia-Shigella, Prevotella and NK4A136.

Additionally, DEAD-box family genes have also been identified as being related to gonadal development in many species. However, the function of vasa and PL10 in abalone is poorly understood on a molecular level. Methods: In the present study, we individually isolated and characterized the vasa and PL10 orthologs in Haliotis discus hannai (Hdh-vasa and Hdh-PL10). We also characterized the mRNA distributions of vasa and PL10 in various tissues from adult organisms and different embryonic developmental stages using real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) techniques. Furthermore, spatial and temporal expression of Hdh-vasa and Hdh-PL10 throughout embryonic and larval development was examined by whole-mount in situ hybridization (WMISH). Results: The two predicted amino acid sequences contained all of the conserved motifs characterized by the DEAD-box family. Homology and phylogenetic analyses indicate that they belong to the vasa and PL10 subfamilies. We found that vasa and PL10 mRNA were not solely restricted to gonads but were widely expressed in various tissues. WMISH showed that Hdh-vasa and Hdh-PL10 largely overlapped, with both being maternally expressed and specifically localized to the micromere lineage cells during early cleavage stages. By the gastrulation stage, Hdh-vasa were expressed strongly in two bilaterally symmetrical paraxial clusters, but Hdh-PL10 was dispersed in entire endodermal region. Our results suggest that Hdh-vasa-expressing cells are located as a subpopulation of undifferentiated multipotent cells that express Hdh-PL10. As such, we infer that primordial germ cells are specified from these vasa-expressing cells at some point during development, and inductive signals (epigenesis) play an important role in specifying primordial germ cells (PGCs) in H. discus hannai. Conclusions: This study provides valuable insights into the molecular characteristics and expression patterns of Hdh-vasa and Hdh-PL10, contributing to a better understanding of their roles in germ cell specification and early embryonic development in H. discus hannai. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/genes16030329

This study evaluated the reproductive performance of tropical abalone (Haliotis squamata) broodstock, induced by feeding them formulated feed containing macroalgae as one of its protein sources. The experimental broodstock specimens were fed a formulated diet consisting of a combination of three macroalgae species: Gracillaria sp., Ulva sp., and Sargassum sp., with increasing protein levels (30, 35, 40, and 45%). The broodstocks were reared in a flow-through water system and fed the respective diet twice a day (5 AM and 8 PM). The gonad maturity level, gonad somatic index, fecundity, and hatching rate were measured at the end of the experiment. This study indicates that the gonad somatic index, fecundity, and hatching rate of the eggs were significantly influenced by the protein level of the diet, with higher values being obtained from the broodstock fed with high protein diets (40-45% crude protein). However, the gonad maturity level showed no difference across all treatments. This study suggests that broodstock reproductive performance can be improved by feeding them a high protein diet with macroalgae as one of the protein sources. © 2025, BIOFLUX SRL.

The PAE pollution levels in the five shellfish species were as follows: Ostreidae (mean = 1064.12 ng/g dw) > Mytilus edulis (mean = 509.88 ng/g dw) > Babylonia areolate (mean = 458.14 ng/g dw) > Mactra chinensis (mean = 378.90 ng/g dw) > Haliotis diversicolor (mean = 335.28 ng/g dw). Dimethyl phthalate (DMP, mean = 69.85 ng/g dw), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP, mean = 41.39 ng/g dw), dibutyl phthalate (DBP, mean = 130.91 ng/g dw), and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP, mean = 226.23 ng/g dw) were the most abundant congeners. Notably, DEHP constituted the most predominant fraction (43.98 %) of the 13 PAEs detected in all shellfish from the PRD. Principal component analysis indicated that industrial and domestic emissions served as main sources for the PAE pollution in shellfish from the PRD. It was estimated that the daily intake of PAEs via shellfish consumption among adults and children ranged from 0.004 to 1.27 μg/kgbw/day, without obvious non-cancer risks (< 0.034), but the cancer risks raised some alarm (2.0 × 10−9–1.4 × 10−5). These findings highlight the necessity of focusing on marine environmental pollutants and emphasize the importance of ongoing monitoring of PAE contamination in seafood. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.172984
Zhang K.; Wang Y.; Zhang Z.,Research progress on mechanism of response to hypoxia stress in abalone; [鲍低氧胁迫响应机制的研究进展],2023,Journal of Fisheries of China,47,9,,,99101,"Aquaculture of abalone has become an important part of China's marine economic development. In recent years, mass mortality events of farmed abalone caused by hypoxia stress, that combined with hypoxia, had often occurred, which had brought serious economic losses to the abalone aquaculture industry and had become an important environmental factor hindering the healthy and sustainable development of the abalone aquaculture industry. In this paper, research progress on the mechanism of response to hypoxia in abalone is reviewed from the perspectives of growth, survival, physiological and biochemical indexes (including, heart rate, metabolism, enzyme activity, pH, etc.), immune function as well as stress response genes and their expression regulation, with a view to providing a reference for further research on abalone's mechanism of response to hypoxia stress and developing new varieties of abalone resistant to hypoxia. In addition, the prevention and control measures of abalone hypoxia stress are also proposed, hoping to help farmers reduce the losses caused by the large-scale death of cultured abalone-caused hypoxic stress in summer.

To evaluate the anti-aging activity of ARE, longevity, exercise ability, lipofuscin level, reproductive ability, and anti-stress ability of Caenorhabditis elegans were detected respectively. The results showed that the main component of ARE was protein. Compared with the control group, the high, middle, and low dose of ARE could significantly prolong the life span of C. elegans, improve the movement ability of C. elegans (the proportion of type A movement increased), and reduce the level of lipofuscin in vivo. Among them, the highest dose of ARE treatment group (2.50 mg/mL) had the strongest effect. The levels of the above indicators changed by 17.36%, 56. 66%, and 21. 93% respectively (P < 0. 05). ARE improved the anti-stress ability of C. elegans. Specifically, the 2. 5 mg/mL ARE treatment group compared with the control group improved the survival rate of heat-damaged C. elegans by 35. 85%, and increased the average life span of C. elegans by 25. 73% under paraquat induced stress condition. Meanwhile, ARE increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) in C. elegans and significantly reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) level. In addition, ARE increased reproductive capacity accompanied with prolonged life span of C. elegans. In conclusion, ARE exhibits good anti-aging activity, which lays a good foundation for the development of abalone functional food. © The Author(s) 2023.",10.13995/j.cnki.11-1802/ts.035128

Additionally, abalone hold essential ecological value by serving as a grazer and providing a microhabitat for various benthic organisms. Currently, seawater is experiencing a decrease in pH due to increased carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. It is projected that by 2100, the pH of seawater will decrease by approximately 0.3–0.4 units, with this trend continuing to 0.7–0.8 units by 2300. Abalone is particularly susceptible to ocean acidification due to its limited ability to maintain acid-base balance. Moreover, even if the effects on abalone are not lethal, world production values and ecosystem balance are likely to be impacted. This review examines the economic and ecological significance of abalone, as well as the morphological and physiological effects of ocean acidification on abalone during its early development, juvenile, and adult stages based on previous studies. In summary, the adverse effects of ocean acidification on abalone depend on several aspects, including the species, developmental stage, size, and duration of exposure. © 2024 The Korean Society of Fisheries and Aquatic Science.",10.47853/FAS.2024.e68

In this study, we investigated the effect of Bacillus sp. KRF-7 (KRF-7), Bacillus sp. PM8313 (PM8313), β-glucooligosaccharide (BGO), and their synbiotics on the growth, digestive physiology, immunity, and gut microbiota of abalone, Haliotis discus hannai. The control diet (CON) was sprayed with 108 CFU/g KRF-7 (PRO1) or PM8313 (PRO2) as probiotics, 0.10% BGO (PRE) as prebiotic, and their combinations (SYN1: PRO1 + BGO; SYN2: PRO2+ BGO) as synbiotic treatments. These diets (triplicates) were given once daily to the abalone (initial body weight: 1.32 ± 0.05 g, initial shell length: 21. 69 ± 0.19 mm) for 12 weeks. The results showed that the PRE diet induced a significant 15% shell length and body weight increase against the CON (SLGR: 45.77% vs. 53.04%; WGR: 182.77% vs. 210.22%), the highest among dietary supplements (P < 0.05). The level of IGF and IGFBP in the cell-free hemolymph, protein expression of IGF signaling, and gene expression of myosin heavy chain in the adductor muscle increased significantly (P < 0.05) following dietary supplementation. Correspondingly, PRE-, PRO1-, and PRO2-fed abalone had the highest trypsin, lipase, and amylase secretion in the hepatopancreas (P < 0.05) and increased histomorphometry (stomach epithelial thickness and intestinal villi height) (P < 0.05). Regarding antioxidative capacity and immunity, the hepatopancreatic expression of SOD, CAT, IRAK-4, NF-Kb, TNF-α, and β-defensin were significantly upregulated in abalone fed with dietary additives compared to the CON (P < 0.05). In terms of gut microbiota profile, PRE-fed abalone had a significant reduction in microbial richness (P < 0.05). The phylum level was similarly occupied, while a diet-specific core microbiota at the genus level was apparent. The findings illustrated that BGO, KRF-7, and PM8313 can be used in abalone aquaculture as growth-promoting and immune-stimulating supplements. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.aqrep.2024.102027

This study also investigated whether betaine as an attractant supplementation could be used to facilitate RBM as a replacement for KM. In Trial 1, RBM was used to replace 25%, 50%, and 100% of the dietary KM (RBM25, RBM50, and RBM100, respectively) based on a diet containing 30% KM (Con). In Trial 2, RBM50 was the same as in Trial 1, and betaine was supplemented in RBM50 at 0.2% (B1), 0.4% (B2), and 0.8% (B3) in the diets. Abalone (weight approximately 4 g) were randomly assigned to four groups replicated in triplicate (60 abalone/replicate). The abalone were fed the experimental diets for 10 weeks. In Trial 1, compared to the Con group, no significant differences were observed in final weight (FW), final shell length (FSL), specific growth rate (SGR), or daily increment in shell length (DISL) at 25% KM replacement by RBM. However, 50% KM replacement significantly reduced the FW, FSL, SGR, and DISL compared to the Con group. There were no significant differences in the proximate composition of the soft body tissues of the abalone. In Trial 2, growth performance parameters of the hybrid abalone were significantly improved with increasing levels of betaine in the diets compared to those fed diet RBM50, reaching the maximum value in the B2 group. Consistent with the feed intake results, the hormone concentrations of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and orexins in the digestive gland and cerebral ganglia of abalone were significantly increased when the supplementation level of betaine in the diets was increased to 0.2%. However, no apparent impacts were observed on NPY or orexin concentrations among the B1, B2, and B3 groups. Finally, we suggest 0.4% betaine supplementation along with replacing 50% of the KM with RBM in the hybrid abalone diet. The optimal diet is a cost-effective alternative feed formulation that can reduce the dependence on KM for abalone production in China. This study also demonstrates the potential of betaine as a feed attractant in abalone aquaculture. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.740161

The halophyte sea purslane (Sesuvium portulacastrum) is nutritionally valuable and shows potential as a novel bait source for abalone. We analyzed the nutrient composition of blanched and salted sea purslane to assess the value of sea purslane as abalone feed. Subsequently, blanched and salted sea purslane were separately used as the sole feed for Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) with the same specifications in each group (shell length: 5.161±0.315 cm, body weight: 16.90±3.07 g). The red alga Gracilaria lemaneiformis served as the control feed. The abalone were feed once every 4 days over an 80-day culture cycle, with sufficient feed dispensed each time to ensure the provision of adequate feed and the generation of leftovers. There were four main findings. First, moisture, energy, crude protein (dry basis), crude fat, carbohydrate, and ash contents were (89.08± 0.01)%, (103.44±0.15) kJ/100 g, (12.49±0.28)%, (2.93±0.06)%, (20.34±0.28)%, and (29.10±0.08)%, respectively, for blanched sea purslane and (59.37±0.04)%, (139.38±0.79) kJ/100 g, (4.16±0.08)%, (1.25±0.01)%, (5.74±0.18)%, and (72.80±0.05)%, respectively, for salted sea purslane. Both types of sea purslane feed contained 18 amino acids, indicating a comprehensive amino acid profile that was relatively close to that of Pacific abalone muscle in terms of the presence of 11 important amino acids. Second, the two types of sea purslane feed significantly influenced the feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of Pacific abalone (P<0.05). The FI and FCR were highest in abalone that fed on salted sea purslane and lowest in abalone that fed on G. lemaneiformis. Neither type of sea purslane feed significantly influenced the survival rate, average daily shell length gain, average daily body weight gain, specific growth rate of shell length, specific growth rate of body weight, condition factor, or meat yield of Pacific abalone (P>0.05). Third, both types of sea purslane feed significantly increased the ash content and reduced the moisture, collagen, and total amino acid contents of Pacific abalone muscle (P<0.05); however, they did not significantly influence the crude fat content, essential amino acids/total amino acids ratio, first limiting amino acid content(P>0.05). The sea purslane feed could increase the linoleic acid and α-linolenic contents of Pacific abalone muscle. Fourth, there were no significant differences in the influence of the two types of sea purslane feed on the springiness and resilience of Pacific abalone muscle tissue (P>0.05). However, blanched sea purslane significantly reduced the hardness and chewiness of the muscle tissue (P<0.05), while salted sea purslane significantly increased the hardness of the muscle tissue (P<0.05). In conclusion, both types of sea purslane feed can replace G. lemaneiformis as feed for Pacific abalone within an 80-day culture cycle. Pacific abalone fed with sea purslane had good production performance and nutritional value, with salted purslane contributing to improved abalone muscle texture. © (2024), (Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences).

It is an intriguing subject that involves biology, engineering, design, and materials science. Biomimicry for impact resistance designs is able to draw inspiration from a range of species, including molluscs like abalone, arthropods such as beetles and crustaceans, fish scales, and creatures like mantis shrimp and armadillos, each presenting distinct structural and defence mechanisms. In addition, helicoidal designs, bone-like structures, sutures, and tubular arrangements in nature are investigated for their impact-resistant characteristics and toughening mechanisms. Implementing biomimicry involves examining nature's details for a specific problem and then shifting those concepts into novel designs or processes. Interestingly, creating actual engineering product requires advanced manufacturing techniques utilising existing resources (or fabrication facilities) such as slip casting, powder metallurgy, additive manufacturing, and so on. These manufacturing methods are also discussed in detail, along with appropriate examples, for the fabrication of bioinspired composites.

The hybrid abalone (Haliotis discus hannai ♀ × H. fulgens ♂, DF), is one of the main varieties of abalone cultured in Fujian Province, China, to resist the high temperature. In this study, the high-temperature resistance of DF abalones was assessed under 28 °C - 32 °C. 31 °C was applied in the subsequent screening experiments of high-temperature resistant individuals. A total of 614,321 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified via super genotyping-by-sequencing (S-GBS), and 69 SNPs involved in 42 candidate genes were identified by genome-wide association study (GWAS). In addition, according to gene functional annotation, the locus with the lowest P value was screened within the threshold range (−log10 P = 4.98296). The genotyping was verified by Sequenom MassARRAY, and 7 SNPs were proved to be related to high temperature resistance in DF population of 100 individuals. 7 candidate genes (fabp, e3rglg4, rgs2, tanc2x6, osbp1, arsb, and uch1) were identified near these SNPs. Finally, these candidate genes were further proved to be associated with the high-temperature resistance trait of DF by the analysis of differential expression genes between sensitive and tolerant individuals. These candidate genes involved regulatory mechanisms such as cell stability, protein repair, lipid metabolism and immune regulation. Notably, the mechanism by which the e3rglg4 gene was involved in the degradation of abnormally folded proteins of abalone under heat stress, corroborating the reliability of the results of GWAS and Sequenom MassARRA. These results complement the shortage of molecular markers for heat resistance of hybrid abalone, provide a reference for marker-assisted selection (MAS) and accelerate the development of heat-resistant abalone varieties. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739576

Six isoenergetic and isolipidic diets containing graded levels of protein (15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, and 40%) were fed to the hybrid abalone for 90 days. Based on the specific growth rate, the optimum dietary protein levels for adult hybrid abalone using a quadratic curve model were estimated to be 28.07% and 26.47% of the diet at 23 °C (optimum temperature) and 27 °C (high temperature), respectively. The amount of crude protein in the abalone body increased linearly with the dietary protein levels and water temperature. Antioxidation enzyme activities of abalone muscle, including GPx and GST were significantly affected by the interaction of dietary protein levels and water temperature. As for texture analysis, the abalone kept at 23 °C exhibited higher meat hardness than those fed the same diets at 27 °C. The n-3 PUFAs (particularly DHA and EPA) in abalone meat were significantly influenced by dietary protein levels, and the highest content was observed in the 30% dietary protein group. These levels were not affected by water temperature. In addition, higher dietary protein levels and water temperatures increased the total contents of free amino acids and flavor amino acids (Asp + Glu + Gly + Ala + Arg + Tau). The cooking loss of abalone meat was reduced with increased protein levels and was significantly lower in the 23 °C group, along with a higher meat postmortem pH value. The collagen fiber ratio and collagen content of abalone meat were higher in the 23 °C group. In summary, for multiple diet feeding strategies in practical production of abalone aquaculture, the balance between the seasonally specific feeds cost benefits and the abalone meat quality should be carefully evaluated. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739907

Abalone muscle digestion products (AMDP) were prepared by subjecting dried abalone to in vitro simulated digestion. Our aim was to investigate the effect of microwave treatment during the drying of abalone muscle on the in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activities of AMDP. The results showed that the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of AMDP from fresh abalone muscle for scavenging capacity against hydroxyl (·OH) radicals, N,N-dimethylp-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (DMPD) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-phenylhydrazine (DPPH) radical were 3.04, 15.18 and 21.12 mg/mL, respectively. The IC50 values for the scavenging of these three radical species decreased gradually with increasing the drying time of abalone muscle. After being fed AMDP from abalone muscle dried for 120 days, the body length of Caenorhabditis elegans increased from 768.90 to 1 034.62 μm, the head swing frequency increased from 206 to 281 times/min, and the life span was extended by 36.16% under normal conditions and by 59.41% and 38.48% under heat stress and oxidative stress conditions, respectively compared with the control group. Meanwhile, with prolonging the drying time of abalone muscle, the antioxidant enzyme activities, reduced glutathione (GSH) content and total antioxidant capacity of C. elegans fed AMDP increased, and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content decreased. In summary, prolonging the drying time and using microwave treatment during the drying process could improve the antioxidant capacity of AMDP. © 2023 Chinese Chamber of Commerce.

Antibiotic resistance in gut microbiota has been extensively researched. The effects of cadmium (Cd) was investigated on the gut microbiota and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) of Haliotis diversicolor, a commercially important abalone species. By exposing H. diversicolor to four concentrations of Cd (0 μg L−1 (control), 6.5 μg L−1 (low), 42.25 μg L−1 (medium), and 274.63 μg L−1 (high)) for 30 and 60 days, 16 types of ARG (aadA-01, aadA-02, cfr, dfrA1, ermB, floR, folA, mecA, sul2, tetB-01, tetC-01, tetD-01, tetG-01, tetM-02, tetQ, vanC-01), and 1213 genus and 27 phylum microbiomes were detected. ARGs can be resistant to aminoglycoside, beta-lactamase, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B, multidrug, florfenicol, macrolide, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and vancomycin. Cadmium exposure significantly alters the abundance of tetC-01, tetB-01, tetQ, sul2, and aadA-01. About 5% (61) of genus-level microorganisms were significantly affected by Cd exposure. Microbiota alpha and beta diversities in the 60-day 42.25 μg L−1 Cd treatment differed significantly from those in other treatments. In addition, 26 pathogens were detected, and two pathogens (Vibrio and Legionella) were significantly affected by Cd exposure. Significant correlations between pathogens and ARGs increased with increased Cd concentration after 60 days of Cd exposure. Cadmium exposure may cause gut microbiota disturbance in H. diversicolor and increase the likelihood of ARG transfer to pathogens, increasing potential ecological and economic risks. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.141507

Temperature is a crucial environmental factor influencing abalone's physiology and energetics, leading to a change in nutritional requirements. However, feeds are generally formulated to match the nutritional requirements at their optimal temperature. Hence, there is a need to optimise dietary protein levels to match temperature-specific requirements during extreme conditions (winter and summer). Given this, a growth trial evaluating five experimental feeds consisting of graded protein inclusion levels (320, 350, 380, 410, and 440 g·kg-1) was conducted on subadult hybrid abalone (Haliotis rubra × H. laevigata) at three different temperatures reflecting winter (12°C), summer (22°C), and the annual average water temperature (17°C) for 143 days. At lower water temperature (12°C), there was a marginal improvement in growth performance as dietary protein levels increased from 320 to 440 g·kg-1. However, at higher water temperatures (when the culture water temperature is above 17°C), there was a significant improvement in growth performance as dietary protein levels increased from 320 to 440 g·kg-1 as evidenced by an improved weight gain, specific growth rate, and feed conversion ratio. Furthermore, increasing dietary protein levels did not compromise the nutritional quality of the abalone tissue at all three tested temperatures. Therefore, during periods of higher water temperatures, feeding Australian hybrid abalone with a relatively high dietary protein level (410 g·kg-1) is expected to result in improved growth, shorter culture duration, and profit maximisation.  © 2023 Abdul Lathiff Inamul Hassan et al.",10.1155/2023/1676340

Restricted by the level of comprehensive utilization technology, the utilization rate of shells is extremely low, resulting in serious waste and pollution. The research shows that the unique brick-mud structure of shells makes them have diverse and good functional characteristics, which guides them to have great utilization potential in different fields. Hence, this review highlights the constitutive relationship between microstructure-function-application of shells (e.g., gastropods, cephalopods, and amniotes), and the comprehensive applications and development ideas in the fields of biomedicine, adsorption enrichment, pHotocatalysis, marine carbon sink, and environmental deicer. It is worth mentioning that marine shells are currently well developed in three areas: bone repair, health care and medicinal value, and drug carrier, which together promote the progress of biomedical field. In addition, an in-depth summary of the application of marine shells in the adsorption and purification of various impurities such as crude oil, heavy metal ions and dyes at low-cost and high efficiency is presented.

High water temperature (>24 °C) is widely accepted as a key contributor to elevated summer mortality. High crude protein levels in modern abalone diets may interact with elevated water temperature to produce detrimental effects on abalone physiological processes but have received scant attention. This study measured the energy used in the digestion, absorption, and assimilation (i.e., specific dynamic action (SDA)) of hybrid abalone (Haliotis laevigata x H. rubra) after four months of acclimation to three protein levels (32, 38 and 44%) at three culture temperatures (12, 17 and 22 °C). Hybrid abalone exhibited significant stepwise increases in meal size as temperature increased from 12 through to 22 °C, contributing to significantly different SDA between the temperature treatments. Resting (standard) aerobic metabolic rate and peak metabolism (peak ṀO) during SDA both increased with temperature, while SDA duration was lowest at 17 °C. No effect of dietary protein was observed within the temperature treatments for the SDA metrics. Abalone held at 12 °C exhibited significantly higher rates of gonad maturation, particularly among females. When 22 °C-acclimated abalone were exposed to a simulated summer heatwave up to 26 °C, they exhibited similar mortality and metabolic responses across protein treatment groups and there was a trend of steadily decreasing ṀO with sustained 26 °C water temperature, probably due to fasting. These results help to inform best farming practices to ensure optimal diet, growth, metabolic performance, and survival of hybrid abalone in the dynamic farm environment. © 2023",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.740185

Cell engineering breeding is an important tool in abalone genetic breeding, and the triploids obtained through this method have high commercial value. However, current research mainly focuses on establishing induction methods and evaluating the growth traits of triploids, while there is a lack of basic research on triploid cytogenetics. Method: In this study, Cytogenetic analysis of triploid Haliotis discus hannai larvae (produced by chemical treatment) and diploid larvae was performed. Result: The results showed that triploid H. discus hannai had a chromosome number of 3n = 54, consisting of 30 metacentric (m) and 24 submetacentric (sm) chromosomes, while the diploids had a chromosome number of 2n = 36, consisting of 20 metacentric (m) and 16 submetacentric (sm) chromosomes. Notably, both triploids and diploids displayed variation in the number of NORs and/or their diameter. The average number of NORs in triploid was significantly higher than that in diploids (p < 0.05), but the average diameter of NORs of triploid was no significant different from that of diploid (p > 0.05). Additionally, 5S rDNA localization to 3 submetacentric chromosomes was observed in triploids, compared to 2 submetacentric chromosomes in diploids. The number of 18S rDNA sites displayed positional conservancy and quantitative variability in both diploids and triploids. Specifically, 18S rDNA was found at the end of the chromosome in both groups, with triploids exhibiting a significantly higher number of loci than diploids (p < 0.01). Conclusion: This study provides valuable insights into the cytogenetic characteristics of triploid H. discus hannai, which could facilitate further research on the stability of the chromosome set in this species.  © 2023 S.

However, its degradation products are acidic and not conducive to subsequent bone tissue regeneration. The main component of abalone shell is calcium carbonate, which can effectively regulate the pH of the microenvironment after bone cement degradation. Because it contains organic factors and trace elements, it greatly improves the biocompatibility of bone cement. In this paper, by adding abalone shell to the bone cement, the injectable property could be increased to 97.20%±0.28%. This is mainly due to the addition of abalone shell powder, which affected the hydration process of the bone cement and prolongated the setting time (up to 26.93 士 0.31 min). On the other hand, abalone shell powder inhibited the growth of calcium sulfate hemihydrate crystals, which made the calcium sulfate hemihydrate crystals smaller (from 1.42 士 0.77 μm to 0.90 士 0.36 μm) in composite bone cement, and effectively alleviated the decrease of pH during the degradation of composite bone cement (from 6.08 士 0.06 to 6.93 士 0.02). The cell survival rate was greatly improved from 87.00% ± 1.60% to 96.41%±1.44%. Therefore, this study indicates that the addition of abalone shell is a potentially effective means to improve the biocompatibility of bone cement in clinical practice. © 2023 Journal of Functional Materials.

This study aimed to establish a method for the analysis of 52 PFASs in typical aquatic products, such as crucian carp, large yellow croaker, shrimp, and clam, by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) after automated solid phase extraction (SPE). After optimization of the conditions of SPE, the recovery and precision of the method is within an acceptable range. The intra-day and inter-day average recoveries of spiked samples ranged from 66.5% to 122.3% and 64.5%-128.0% for crucian carp, large yellow croaker, shrimp, and clam, with intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviation (RSD) of 0.78%-11.4%, and 2.54%-24.2%. The ranges of method detection limits (MDLs) and quantification limits (MQLs) of PFASs were 0.003–0.60 ng/g and 0.005–2.0 ng/g, respectively. The accuracy of the method was also verified by standard reference material (SRM), and the measured values of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were in the allowable range. The method was applied to analyze aquatic products from the local supermarket. The concentrations of ∑PFASs ranged from 13.9 ng/g ww to 75.5 ng/g ww. PFOS was the dominant pollutant, accounting for 79.6% of ∑PFASs. The branch-chain isomers, perfluoro-3-methylheptane sulfonate (P3MHpS) and perfluoro-6-methylheptane sulfonate (P6MHpS) accounted for one-quarter of PFOS. Long-chain perfluoro carboxylic acids (PFCAs) were also detected in most samples. The estimated daily intake of PFOS was over the recommended tolerable intake by several organizations such as the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), the New Jersey Drinking Water Quality Institute (NJDWQI), and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). PFOS would have posed health risks to consumers through dietary exposure. © 2023",10.1016/j.jchromb.2023.123736
Chen W.; Zhang Y.; Lu J.; Xu N.; Sun X.,Effects of trehalose on the physiological parameters and gene expression of high-temperature stressed Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis; [海藻糖对高温胁迫龙须菜的生理及基因表达的影响],2024,Journal of Fisheries of China,48,6,,,69605,"Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis is a kind of cultivated seaweed with the second highest production in China, which is mainly used to feed abalone and extract agar, but its yield and cultivated period are limited due to the high temperature of the summer in the southern coast. As a signaling molecule, non-reducing disaccharide trehalose plays an important role in enduring high temperature, drought and other adverse stresses. To explore the role and mechanism of trehalose in the stress resistance of G. lemaneiformis, this paper investigated the effects of exogenous trehalose on the growth, stress resistance-related substances, metabolic enzymes, endogenous salicylic acid and related genes under high temperature stress using physiological and biochemical test, HPLC-MS/MS and real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). The results showed that application of 10 mmol/L trehalose promoted the algal growth and proline content of G. lemaneiformis with 0.34-fold (3 d) and 0.30-fold increases (24 h) compared to the control, respectively. Meanwhile, trehalose significantly activated the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and the activities of superoxide dismutase and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, but malonaldehyde content and lipoxidase (LOX) activity were reduced. Moreover, trehalose significantly stimulated the activity and gene expression of isochorismate synthase, the key enzyme in salicylic acid biosynthesis, and the accumulation of salicylic acid (2.05-fold). Finally, supplementation with trehalose could maintain the stable increase of the gene expression level of heat shock protein 70, while the lox2 gene expression was downregulated at 12 h. All of these results revealed that trehalose could promote algal growth through scavenging the reactive oxygen species, alleviating the lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane, enhancing the accumulation of osmolytes and phytohormones and so on. This study verifies that exogenous trehalose plays a vital role in resisting high temperature, which will provide a reference for future breeding efforts to improve the stress resistance of G. lemaneiformis.

Elliott N.,Genetic variation is the foundation for the future of abalone conservation and exploitation,2023,Developments in Aquaculture and Fisheries Science,42,,161,188,,"Knowledge and application of genetic variation is the foundation for the survival and exploitation of abalone, and its potential will be reached through greater communication and collaboration. Genetics encompasses a broad field of disciplines focused on the building blocks of life, the DNA molecules, which make up the genome of an organism. Whether working with individual genes or their protein products, random segments of DNA sequence or the entire genome, or the resulting phenotypes, variation is observed between individuals, populations, and species. It is utilized to assist in elucidating the phylogeny and relationships of the more than 50 extant species and subspecies of Haliotis. Genetic variation helps to determine connectivity between natural populations, which in turn helps managers determine fishery and conservation strategies to ensure sustainability and survival. Selective breeding programs—essential tools for the sustainable growth of the aquaculture sector—are founded upon and exploit the genetic variation of economically important traits. Genetic technologies are rapidly changing and to understand their potential requires ongoing communication with end users. This is particularly so as technologies become more cost-effective for application to the multiple needs of abalone, and within reach of research and commercial budgets. The recent sequencing of abalone species genomes is anticipated to have major flow-on in delivering greater knowledge and tools at a biological and molecular level not previously available. The application of genomic tools, as well as those of other disciplines such as metabolomic, proteomic, and epigenetic, has the potential to add significantly to the core areas of taxonomy, fishery management, conservation, and aquaculture. To exploit these fully for the benefit of all sectors requires improved international collaboration to maximize scientific knowledge. In addition to the new tools, opportunities need to be grasped to integrate other scientific disciplines with genetic studies, be that biogeographic and oceanographic to assist understanding natural populations, or nutritional and physiological to support aquaculture production. The culture of abalone globally will continue to expand, and to support such growth will require an increase in the application of selective breeding programs. These will take advantage of the inherent genetic variability present in abalone, as well as the opportunities presented by the ease of interspecies hybridization and the incorporation of genomic information to assist selection decisions. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/B978-0-12-814938-6.00006-3

Each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate groups of 18 abalones (34.27 ± 2.93 g) that were stocked in sea cages for 8 weeks. Results showed that the maximum weight gain (WG) and specific growth rate (SGR) were obtained in hybrid male abalone fed D10 diets. The highest gonad somatic index (GSI) value was found in the D14 diet. Moreover, the ANOVA results showed that only dietary protein could significantly affect the GSI of hybrid male abalones (P < 0.05). A significant difference was observed among the groups in terms of total protein, total cholesterol, triglyceride, acid phosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of vasa in the testis of D14 abalone was the lowest. Abalones fed the D14 diet had higher testosterone levels and sperm in the testis than those fed other diets. In conclusion, protein of 300 g/kg, VE of 0.1 g/kg, and VC of 1.5 g/kg (D10) and protein of 350 g/kg, VE of 0.1 g/kg, and VC of 1 g/kg (D14) might be the optimal combinations in the diet for growth and gonadal development of hybrid male abalones respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/s10499-023-01100-z

Yet, such information is lacking for Australian hybrid abalone (Haliotis rubra × Haliotis laevigata), particularly with respect to life stage and water temperatures. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of dietary protein inclusion level on the growth performance, nutrient utilisation and nutritional quality of juvenile (3·3 g) Australian hybrid abalone reared at three different temperatures representative of winter (12°C), average annual (17°C) and summer (22°C) grow-out periods and fed five diets containing graded dietary protein levels of 35, 38, 41, 44 and 47 %. Abalone growth increased with increasing water temperature with weight gains of approximately 100, 280 and 380 % of their initial weight at 12, 17 and 22°C, respectively. Furthermore, the present study clearly demonstrated that higher dietary protein inclusion levels (41 %) than those currently used commercially (35 %) would significantly improve the growth performance when water temperatures are ≥17°C without any adverse impacts on nutrient utilisation, nutrient deposition or nutritional quality of the abalone soft tissue. For example, at 22°C abalone fed a diet containing 41 % protein obtained a significantly higher weight gain percentage (421 %) compared with those fed a diet containing 35 % protein (356 %). Lastly, it is suggested that maintaining a dietary protein inclusion level of 35 % or implementing a 'least cost' feeding approach during cooler seasons, or where water temperatures are ∼12°C, may be beneficial, considering only marginal growth improvements were observed during these periods of slow growth.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Summer mortality likely involves complex interactions between biological, environmental, husbandry and nutritional factors; however, this is poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a case-control study for farmed greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) and hybrid abalone (H. laevigata × Haliotis rubra) to identify risk factors associated with summer mortality. Farm mortality data from 2015 to 2021 were used to identify tanks which fit the case definition and tanks that did not. We constructed a model to predict summer mortality risk using logistic regression and forward variable selection. Modelling considered 61 potential risk factors (examples included water quality, husbandry, climate, biology). The final selected model including six main effects and five two-way interactions. Except for maximum water temperature in the week prior to the case/control date, all parameters selected in the final model were involved in one or more interactions. The model identified interactions between age and each of previous year summer mortality, size when removed from weaning tanks and feed rate. There were also interactive effects of previous year summer mortality and size when removed from weaning tanks, and of feed rate and post-grading mortality. The risk of summer mortality was two times more likely for every 2 °C increase in maximum weekly water temperature. Post-grading mortality was associated with an increased risk of summer mortality, but relative risk decreased at higher feed rates. Risk of summer mortality in younger abalone increased with higher feed rates, while increasing feed rates for 30-month abalone had no effect on the risk of summer mortality. Abalone in tanks which experienced summer mortality the previous year were at a higher risk of summer mortality regardless of age. For abalone that did not experience summer mortality the year prior, the subsequent risk of summer mortality increased with abalone age. Improved understanding of summer mortality risk factors may help guide management strategies and future research to advance abalone aquaculture. © 2023",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739928

During this period, abalone pass through profound morphological and physiological changes, which suitable nutrient requirements must sustain. An inadequate diet can result in adverse effects such as late metamorphosis, starvation, slow growth and even death during this phase. Two strategies have been proposed to increase the growth and survival rates of weaning abalone: (i) extending feeding with benthic diatoms and (ii) abalone hybridization via interspecific crosses. To evaluate the efficiency of the two strategies, we assessed the growth and survival rates of postlarvae of pure red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and a hybrid obtained by crossing red abalone females with green abalone (H. fulgens) males. Both crosses were supplied with six different diets consisting of either one macroalgae mono-diet (Macrocystis pyrifera or Ulva ohnoi) or a mixture with Navicula incerta. Overall, cross-specific diets achieved better growth rates, suggesting that each cross may need specific food items (nutrients) during weaning. Moreover, pure red abalone generally showed the highest growth rates, while the hybrid abalone showed the highest survival rates with most tested diets. Hence, hybrids appear to be better at withstanding stressful con-ditions, and their use in aquaculture could reduce losses and increase commercial production. © 2023 CSIC.",10.3989/scimar.05300.055
Yingpu W.; Jiaqi L.; Suyan X.; Lirong C.; Longfei L.; Yitao Z.; Yuze M.,Effects of three kinds of snails on the control of oysters attached to the shell of cultured abalone; [3 种螺对养殖鲍外壳附着牡蛎的防除作用],2023,Journal of Fishery Sciences of China,30,3,344,351,,"Haliotis discus hannai Ino is a commercially important marine mollusk with a well-known high nutritional value. During cage cultivation, biofouling organisms such as oysters, sea squirts, coil worms, and barnacles often attach to the shell surface of abalone, subsequently affecting the appearance and commercial value of the abalone. Oysters that attach to the inner wall of the cage also affect the growth and survival of abalone. Because manual removal of biofouling organisms is not possible, prevention and control of oyster growth are difficult in abalone cage cultivation. Currently, two aspects of fouling organism prevention and removal are being studied: Fouling organisms attachment mechanisms and other influencing factors can be reduced on the one hand by lowering the adhesion rate; on the other hand biological control can be achieved by selecting oyster feeding species, co-cultivating with farmed shellfish, and attempting to reduce the number of fouling organisms. In this study, we compared the effects of Thais clavigera Kuster, Ceratostoma rorifluum, and Cantharus cecillei on preventing oysters from attaching to the outer shell of the abalone. Starting in the middle of July, three different types of snails were placed in the cage every 15 days for a total of six times. The cage without snails was taken as the control group. According to the results, at the end of the experiment, the number of surviving oysters on the abalone in the Cantharus cecillei group was (0.04±0.04)/ind, the number of surviving oysters in the Thais clavigera Kuster group was (2.49±0.91)/ind, the number of surviving oysters in the Ceratostoma rorifluum group was (2.21±1.05)/ind, and the number of oysters in the control group was (3.33±0.46)/ind. The three species of snails were significantly lower than the control group, with Cantharus cecillei significantly lower than the other two snail species (P<0.05). The timing of snail addition also affects the effectiveness of the snails in preventing oyster fouling. Late addition of the snails resulted in a significant number of remaining oyster shells. The control effect can be guaranteed when the shell height of the oyster is approximately 0.5 cm. In addition, the dead oyster shell height of the Cantharus cecillei group was (0.73±0.27) cm, which was significantly lower than that of the Thais clavigera Kuster group (0.88±0.28) cm, the Ceratostoma rorifluum group (0.93±0.28) cm, and the control group (0.92±0.24) cm (P<0.05). These results indicate that the size of oysters consumed by Cantharus cecillei was smaller than that of the other two snails. The three types of snails had significant control effects, and Cantharus cecillei was the most effective in preventing oyster attachment. Oyster control is affected by the time when the three types of snails feed, so it is necessary to choose the appropriate time to release the snails. When a large number of oysters have attached and grown to a certain size, Thais clavigera Kuster and Ceratostoma rorifluum can supplement Cantharus cecillei. © 2023, Journal of Fishery Sciences of China.

Ragg N.L.C.,"Physiology: Energetics, metabolism, and gas exchange",2023,Developments in Aquaculture and Fisheries Science,42,,119,160,,"Abalone present an unrivalled opportunity to investigate metabolic function and gas exchange in a gastropod that retains ancestral features, including paired organs and secondary shell openings. If Haliotis is regarded as a functionally homogenous genus, it is concluded that the gills are responsible for almost all gas exchange, rather than exploiting modified mantle or epipodium surfaces, as favored by many other gastropods. Gill ventilation is facilitated by external water currents, supporting a two- to three-fold increase in resting metabolic rate above levels in static water. Further increases in metabolic rate are achieved by recruiting the otherwise under-perfused left gill. As aerobic scope is exceeded, energy demand is initially supported by phosphoarginine and then anaerobic glycolysis and the tauropine and, to a lesser extent, alanopine, lysopine, and strombine pathways. Even modest muscular exertion may induce a localized anaerobic response as hemolymph circulation preferentially targets the central vasculature rather than muscles. Muscle blocks must also retain resident hemolymph to provide hydrostatic antagonism for muscle fiber extension. In the foot this is achieved using a valve structure. The valve also guards the main vasculature from damaging pressure surges and may be combined with transient cardiac arrest. Circulating hemocyanin protein tightly binds oxygen, with unloading further discouraged by a reverse Bohr shift which appears consistent with an oxygen storage function, only unloading when tissue oxygen tension is very low. Metabolic performance in resting, active, and feeding abalone is considered in the context of a changing ocean climate. As Haliotis is, in fact, far from structurally or functionally homogenous, some guidance is offered for on-going research to develop a more representative synthesis of the physiological mechanisms of this extraordinary snail. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/B978-0-12-814938-6.00005-1

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) has a positive effect on inhibiting nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-mediated inflammation. The underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear, particularly in mollusks. Consequently, this study will investigate the process of vitamin D3/VDR regulating NF-κB pathway and further explore their functions on inflammation, autophagy, and apoptosis in abalone Haliotis discus hannai. Results showed that knockdown of VDR by using siRNA and dsRNA of VDR in vitro and in vivo led to more intense response of NF-κB signaling to lipopolysaccharide and higher level of apoptosis and autophagy. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulation after VDR silencing could partially alleviate apoptosis and induce autophagy. Overexpression of VDR restricted the K48-polyubiquitin chain-dependent inhibitor of κB (IκB) ubiquitination and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) oligomerization. Besides, VDR silencing resulted in increase of ASC speck formation. In further mechanistic studies, we showed that VDR can directly bind to IκB and IKK1 in vitro and in vivo. In the feeding trial, H&E staining, TUNEL, and electron microscope results showed that vitamin D3 deficiency (0 IU/kg) could recruit more basophilic cells and increase more TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells and lipid droplets (LDs) than vitamin D3 supplement (1000 IU/kg and 5000 IU/kg). In summary, abalone VDR plays a negative regulator role in NF-κB-mediated inflammation via interacting with IκB and inhibiting ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκB. Vitamin D3 in combination with VDR is essential to establish a delicate balance between autophagy and apoptosis in response to inflammation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",10.1007/s10565-021-09647-4

The control diet was a basal diet without inosine supplementation, and five experimental diets were supplemented with different levels of inosine 5’-monophosphate at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0%. Each diet was fed to triplicates group of abalone with initial average body weight and shell length 5.68 ± 0.11 g and 33.71 ± 0.57 mm, respectively. Abalone were stocked in the rectangular plastic baskets at a density of 25 abalone in each. The experimental diets were fed to abalone at a level 1-1.5% from total body weight once a day for twelve weeks feeding period. The results showed that final weight, weight gain, specific growth rate, final shell length, shell length gain and total hemocyte count were not significantly influenced by dietary inosine 5’-monophosphate. However, the total hemocyte count of abalone fed nucleotides-supplemented diets was higher than the control diet. Thus, the present study indicated that inclusion of purine nucleotides, particularly inosine 5’-monophosphate in the practical diet, did not show to improve growth of abalone. However, supplementation of inosine 5’-monophosphate has a potential to enhance health status of abalone by elevating immune response parameter. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

This can pose a serious threat to human health and well-being. In this scenario, it is imperative to explore novel antimicrobial agents to fight against multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogenic bacteria. This study employed rational design strategies, including truncation, amino acid replacement, and heterozygosity, to obtain seven α-helical, cationic, and engineered peptides based on the original template of Abhisin. Among the analogs of Abhisin, AB7 displayed broad-spectrum and potent antimicrobial activity, superior targeting of membranes and DNA, and the ability to disrupt biofilms and anti-endotoxins in vitro. Additionally, we evaluated the anti-infection ability of AB7 using a murine skin wound model infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and found that AB7 displayed negligible toxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, AB7 exhibited desirable therapeutic efficacy by reducing bacterial burden and pro-inflammatory mediators, modulating cytokines, promoting wound healing, and enhancing angiogenesis. These results highlight the potential of AB7 as a promising candidate for a new antibiotic. Key points: • A α-helical, cationic, and engineered peptide AB7 was obtained based on Abhisin. • AB7 exhibited potent antimicrobial activity and multiple bactericidal actions. • AB7 effectively treated infected skin wounds in mice.

The meat quality of abalone is affected by diet and temperature, and this in turn directly influences consumer acceptance of abalone products and financial returns to producers. The aim of this study was to investigate the impacts of diet (Gracilaria lemaneiformis vs artificial feed) and water temperature (low, 19 °C and high, 27 °C) on growth performance, nutritional value, flavor, and sensory quality of abalone. The results showed that artificial feed led to increases in growth, content of body protein, total free amino acids (TAA), delicious amino acids (DAA), volatile compounds (alcohols, acids, aromatic compounds, and esters), and sensory quality (hardness) of abalone meat. High temperature significantly decreased the growth, body moisture, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and hardness but increased the contents of DAA, TAA, alcohols, acids, and aromatic compounds in abalone meat. Our study suggests that high temperature significantly decreases the growth and nutritional value of abalone muscle but does provide a different mouthfeel and flavor for consumers, and nutrition-balanced artificial feed as the diet at a low water temperature maximizes the growth of abalone without sacrificing meat quality. The results may help to formulate an optimal feed strategy for farming industries throughout the abalone culture period, thereby allowing farmers to harvest premium quality abalone and elevate the market value of abalone products. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739241
Zhang K.; Wang Y.; Zhang Z.,Research progress on response mechanism to high temperature stress in abalone; [鲍高温胁迫响应机制的研究进展],2023,Journal of Fisheries of China,47,5,,,59601,"Abalone is one of the important economic shellfish for marine aquaculture. In recent years, under the stress of high temperatures in summer, mass mortality of abalone has often occurred, which has brought huge economic losses to the aquaculture industry. This paper reviews the events of mass mortality of farmed abalone in recent years and summarizes the research progress on the response mechanism of abalone to high-temperature stress abalone from the perspectives of physio-biochemical indicators including growth, reproduction, survival, metabolism and enzyme activity as well as, cellular immunity, antioxidant system, heat shock protein, apoptosis, NF-κB signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and other related genes expression, DNA methylation, genetic diversity, etc. summarized the research progress of the response mechanism of abalone to high-temperature stress. Existing studies have shown that high temperature stress can cause abnormal physiological and biochemical in abalone to reduce metabolic levels such as feeding, destroy the stability of abalone's internal environment, reduce abalone's ability to resist pathogen invasion and respond to external environmental stimuli, thereby adversely affecting abalone's growth and immunity, which eventually lead to the death of stressed abalone. In order to provide a reference for understanding the response mechanism of abalone to high-temperature stress, facilitate the investigation of the breeding of high-temperature-resistant varieties of abalone and preventing the occurrence of mass mortality of abalone in summer.

Traditionally, fish meal (FM) has been the primary source of protein in aquafeed. However, there is a growing need to explore alternative sources of protein. The present study aimed first to investigate the potential of alternative animal protein sources, such as shrimp head meal (SM) and meat and bone meal (MBM), to replace FM in the diet of tropical abalone Haliotis squamata, and second to evaluate their effects on the growth of the organism. Four experimental diets were formulated, including a control diet containing FM, SM, MBM, and a mixture of fish meal, shrimp head meal, and meat and bone meal (MIX). The experimental diets were fed to triplicate groups of abalone once a day at a level of 1.5% of their total body weight. Two hundred and forty abalone with an initial average weight of 3.55±0.02 g and a shell length of 28.59±0.12 mm were distributed into 12 rectangular plastic baskets at a density of 20 abalone per basket. After twelve weeks of feeding, the final weight, weight gain, specific growth rate, final shell length, and shell length gain of abalone fed the FM diet were not significantly different (p > 0.05) from those fed the other diet treatments. Dietary treatments also did not affect the total haemocyte count (THC) of abalone. These findings suggest that SM or MBM could partially or entirely replace FM in the abalone feed. © 2023, BIOFLUX SRL. All rights reserved.",

A better understanding of the pollution sources of the coastal areas is essential for developing comprehensive ecological environment management approaches for Sansha Bay. Based on land use data, socialeconomic statistics and pollution source investigation data, the pollutant discharge coefficient method was used to evaluate the total nitrogen and total phosphorus fluxes into Sansha Bay, the largest bay in Fujian Province. A comprehensive and systematic analysis was conducted to investigate the composition and distribution of the pollutants. The results show that the net total nitrogen and total phosphorus fluxes produced by land-based sources (including industrial production, residents' living, cultivation, livestock and poultry breeding, and land-based fish farming) and sea-based pollution sources (including tidal flat aquaculture, raft culture, and cage culture) in 2020 were 238 and 622 tons, respectively. The primary source of the total nitrogen and total phosphorus was land-based pollution, with fluxes of 2 564 and 352 tons, respectively. The fluxes of total nitrogen and total phosphorus from the primary sea-based pollution sources were -2 326 and 270 tons, respectively. Cultivation was the dominant land-based source of pollution, accounting for 46.4% and 41.4% of the total nitrogen and total phosphorus fluxes, respectively. Notable heterogeneity was observed in the total nitrogen and total phosphorus fluxes across the watersheds. The Jiaoxi Watershed, with the largest watershed area, was responsible for the greatest proportion of land-based pollutant fluxes. Feed-based aquaculture (such as fish, abalone, and sea cucumber feeding) was the main sea-based pollution source, whereas the non-feeding shellfish and macroalgae can assist in the assimilation of the nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients. © 2024, China Environmental Science Press.

Stone D.A.J.; Bansemer M.S.; Currie K.-L.,Abalone nutrition,2023,Developments in Aquaculture and Fisheries Science,42,,9,44,,"Wild abalone graze on a range of micro and macroalgal species. Macroalgae are also used to feed farmed abalone in a number of countries, including China, Korea, South Africa, and Chile. Abalone cultured in intensive systems are predominantly reliant on formulated feeds. These diets are formulated using current knowledge of the nutritional requirements of a range of cultured abalone and fish species, and use a range of terrestrial ingredients (cereal, oilseed, and pulse meals) and low levels of marine ingredients (sustainable levels of fish meal and fish oil). Any number of ingredient and inclusion level combinations can be used to arrive at the nutrient specifications. Abalone, like fish and other animals, have a requirement for protein (essential amino acids), lipids (omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids), and a range of vitamins and minerals. Although research into abalone dietary development has been extensive, knowledge gaps remain regarding nutrient requirements and their role in growth, health, and product quality. Unlike for some commonly cultured freshwater and marine fish, such as rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), knowledge of the key nutrient requirements for essential amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals for commonly cultured species of abalone are incomplete or nonexistent. This places some constraints on formulating commercial production diets for optimum growth and health. To improve abalone production further, it is recommended that research be conducted to establish more detailed nutrient requirement information for abalone on a species-by-species basis. Research needs to occur in relation to age, water temperature, and the use of traditional and new ingredients for formulated feeds to optimize commercial abalone production. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/B978-0-12-814938-6.00002-6

Less is known about MDPV pharmacokinetics, especially with respect to brain concentrations of the drug and its metabolites. Objectives: The goal of the present study was: 1) to determine brain concentrations of MDPV and its metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxypyrovalerone (3,4-catechol-PV) and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-pyrovalerone (4-OH-3-MeO-PV), after administration of MDPV, and 2) to relate brain pharmacokinetic measures to pharmacodynamic end-points in the same subjects. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-400 g) received s.c. MDPV injection (1, 2, or 4 mg/kg) or its saline vehicle. Groups of rats were decapitated at 40 min and 240 min postinjection. Locomotor behavior was rated before decapitation, and the core temperature was obtained. Plasma and frontal cortex were analyzed to quantitate MDPV and its metabolites. Striatal samples were analyzed to measure dopamine, serotonin (5-HT), and their metabolites. Results: MDPV displayed brain-to-plasma ratios greater than 1 (range 8.8-12.1), whereas 3,4-catechol-PV and 4-OH-3-MeO-PV showed ratios less than 1 (range 0-0.3). MDPV increased behavioural scores reflective of locomotor stimulation at 40 and 240 min and produced slight hyperthermia at 240 min. MDPV had no effect on striatal dopamine but produced an increase in the metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA). Brain MDPV concentrations were positively correlated with behavioural scores and striatal HVA but not with other endpoints. Conclusion: The behavioural effects of MDPV are related to brain concentrations of the parent drug and not its metabolites. The modest effects of MDPV on monoamine systems suggest that other non-monoamine mechanisms may contribute to the effects of the drug in vivo. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.",10.2174/1381612828666220907100036

A total of 1260 abalone were randomly distributed into 18 net cages (seventy per cage). Five formulated diets were prepared. The control (CEB0) diet contained 20% S. japonica powder. Twenty-five, 50%, 75%, and 100% of S. japonica were substituted with the equal amount of CEB, referred to as the CEB25, CEB50, CEB75 and CEB100 diets, respectively. Ultimately, dry S. japonica was prepared to compare formulated diets on growth of abalone. Each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate groups of abalone and fed to abalone every other day for 16 weeks. After the 16-week feeding trial, abalone were subjected to air exposure for 24 h, and then survival was monitored for the next 6 days. All formulated diets achieved greater weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) than those of abalone fed the S. japonica. Weight gain and SGR of abalone linearly improved with dietary increased substitution levels of S. japonica with CEB. Shell growth of abalone tended to agree with growth rate. The chemical composition of the soft body of abalone was not affected by the experimental diets. Survival of abalone fed all formulated diets was (P < 0.05) higher than that of abalone fed S. japonica at the end of the 6-day post observation period after the 24-h air exposure. In conclusion, S. japonica could be completely (100%) substituted with CEB in abalone feeds when 20% S. japonica was included. Substitution of S. japonica with CEB in feeds could improve growth of abalone, but lower feed cost. © 2021",10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.100977

Monitoring efforts have varied in frequency and type across years. In 2017, the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service initiated a southern sea otter monitoring and research plan to determine the effects of military readiness activities on the growth or decline of the southern sea otter population at San Nicolas Island. The southern sea otter is the only subspecies of sea otter in California (hereafter, “sea otter""). The monitoring program, at its basic level, includes seasonal surveys of population abundance, distribution, and foraging activity. From 2020 to 2023, we measured a 10-percent per annum increase in population abundance (95-percent confidence interval =0–20 percent), with 146 total individuals as of April 2023. Coinciding with the recent population growth, the sea otter distribution, which previously tended to concentrate on the island’s west end during 2003–2006 before shifting toward more use in the north and south sides during 2017–2019, appears to have shifted again during 2020–2023 to concentrate at the island’s east end. Forage data were collected between February 2020 and April 2023. There was a total of 773 forage dives in 60 forage bouts, with most of the identified prey on successful dives (n=401) recorded as sea urchins (66 percent), followed by bivalves (15 percent), snails (12 percent), and crabs (5.2 percent). Two lobsters and three abalone also were identified among the sea otter prey. Estimates of energy intake rates averaged 14.0 kilocalories per minute (95-percent confidence interval =10.8–17.2 kilocalories per minute). Monitoring data from the past two decades indicate that sea otters at San Nicolas Island have maintained a steady pattern of energy intake and population growth characteristic of a robust population, including a sixfold growth between 2000 and 2023. There was no conclusive evidence of density-dependent effects based on these patterns; however, estimates of energy intake rates for 2020–2023 were slightly lower than previous estimates from 2017 to 2019. Additionally, subtidal monitoring results at four sites around San Nicolas Island indicated that counts of purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) have increased between 2003 and 2023, whereas sea otter foraging surveys completed during the same period revealed that some sea otters have shifted toward higher consumption of purple sea urchins and bivalves compared to red sea urchins (S. fransicanus), which generally are the preferred larger prey of sea otters. These results contribute to the understanding of population dynamics and to the conservation and planning of future monitoring and research of sea otters at San Nicolas Island. © 2023, US Geological Survey.

In this study, two 14-3-3 cDNAs were identified from the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai (designated 14-3-3ζ and 14-3-3ε), possessing 59.40% identity with each other. Both genes were predominantly expressed in the gills of unchallenged abalones, and their mRNA signals could also be detected in several other tissues, including the mantle, hepatopancreas and ovary. However, after Vibrio harveyi challenge, hemocytes were induced significantly (p < 0.01). Meanwhile, phagocytosis was inhibited, but apoptosis, reactive oxygen species formation, and caspase 3 expression were significantly induced (p < 0.01), and they were all suppressed with 14-3-3ζ knockdown (p < 0.01). The differences were that silencing 14-3-3ε reverted the decline in the phagocytic rate derived from bacterial infection, while ROS formation was not influenced significantly. In addition, the expression levels of several antimicrobial peptide and proinflammatory cytokine genes were also decreased with the silencing of 14-3-3 genes. However, with the knockdown of 14-3-3ζ, the expression of 14-3-3ε was further significantly increased (p < 0.01), and vice versa.

Two Family I84 members, scSI-1 and scSI-2, were reported from the razor clam Sinonovacula constricta in a previous research. In the present study, 12 additional genes, named scSI-3 to scSI-14, were identified via genome wide sequence analyses. Among them, 10 genes were predicted to have a signal sequence, but one (scSI-7) was not. Besides, one sequence (scSI-14) was likely to encode a prematurely terminated peptide. The predicted mature peptides shared characteristics including 12 conserved cysteine residues, isoelectric points of 4.98 to 6.11, and molecular weights of 7.1 to 9.3 kDa with previously reported family members. Four motifs were characterized in 13 predicted mature peptides (with exception of scSI-14), which shared two to four conserved cysteine residues, are possibly to form two functional domain comprised 6 cysteine residues, respectively. At genomic level, all the 14 razor clam Family I84 genes were organized into 3 exons and 2 introns; 13 of them clustered in 3 regions of 100 kb on 3 separate chromosomes, suggesting tandem duplications of related genes. The promoter region of all the 14 genes was predicted to share some transcription factor binding sites, in particular those responsive to pathological and physiological stimuli, but no shared motifs were identified. Analyses also revealed differences in expression patterns among the genes. One gene in a tandem duplicated gene pairs usually showed a higher expression level than the other whereas non-tandem duplicated genes exhibited a higher degree of correlation in expression level.

Sulfated polysaccharide from pacific abalone (AGSP) reduced the level of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and increased the production of short chain fatty acids in the colon of mice, and it reduced the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and increased the IL-10 level in in vitro cell models, suggesting that it can be used as a probiotic agent to inhibit intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, AGSP reduced the disease activity index and intestinal damage, improved the mucosal immune response, and inhibited oxidative damage in mice with DSS-induced acute and chronic colitis, which can be associated with modulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway and gut microbiota. AGSP regulated the structure of the gut microbiota and reduced the level of Bacteroides that had positive correlation with the colitis symptoms. The in vitro result showed that AGSP may inhibit mucin degradation by Bacteroides via the change of the polysaccharide utilization strategy, which can protect intestinal barrier integrity. This study is useful to understand the mechanism by which AGSP ameliorates colitis and related diseases and promotes further development of AGSP. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",10.1039/d1fo02431k
Cook P.A.,"Introduction, taxonomy, and general biology of abalone",2023,Developments in Aquaculture and Fisheries Science,42,,1,8,," Abalone are marine snails that belong to a group of invertebrates called molluscs, that also include common bivalves such as scallops, oysters, mussels, pippies, and cockles, as well as octopus, squid, and cuttlefish. Abalone have a moderate to heavily calcified snail-like, flattened shell. They belong to the exclusively marine family, Haliotidae and to the single genus-level taxon, Haliotis. There are 56 valid species, with 18 additional subspecies. Abalone shells are flattened, similar to limpets, and have little external signs of coiling. The shell has a wide opening for the body and a single row of respiratory pores along one side that are used in respiration, excretion, and reproduction. The flat body shape of abalone is important in reducing drag forces that are generated by waves that are typical of their shallow, exposed coastal reef habitat. Viewed from the ventral side, the internal anatomy is dominated by a large, flat, muscular foot, surrounded by a pigmented epipodium, which is a flat circle of tissue with sensory tentacles. On temperate and tropical shores, abalone occur from the low intertidal to a depth of about 30 m, especially in areas supporting seaweed beds, where adults are macroalgal herbivores. In most areas where abalone are common, they have formed the basis of important fisheries. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/B978-0-12-814938-6.00001-4
Li Q.; Lu J.; Chang Y.; Shen G.; Feng J.,Effect of different cooking methods on nutritional intake and different storage treatments on nutritional losses of abalone,2022,Food Chemistry,377,,,,132047,"As the most important marine edible shellfish, the nutritional quality of abalone has been paid attention. In this study, the chemical and nutritional compositions of abalones were obtained, and three cooking methods, steaming, boiling and frying, were evaluated by in vitro gastric digestion simulation to understand their nutritional changes by 1H NMR spectroscopy combined with multivariate statistical analyses. The nutritional losses were also monitored under different cold storage conditions. The results indicated that boiling can keep more amino acids and fatty acids than steaming and frying, thus being recommended as the best cooking method of abalone. The abalone could maintain fresh within one day under 4 °C, and the deterioration process occurred subsequently. These results help to understand the digestion of cooked abalone and the changes of nutrients through storage and cooking process, leading to a scientific recommendation of cooking method and storage condition for healthy eating. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.132047
Dawood M.A.O.,Dietary Copper Requirements for Aquatic Animals: A Review,2022,Biological Trace Element Research,200,12,5273,5282,,"Copper (Cu) is a vital microelement required for the optimum growth performance and wellbeing of aquatic animals. It contributed to various biological, physiological, and metabolic function in the entire body of the aquatic animals. Further, Cu is a cofactor for several enzymes involved in the antioxidation capacity and metalloenzyme formation. Some ingredients used for aquafeed formulation include sufficient amounts of Cu that can provide aquatic animals with their requirements. Nevertheless, in some cases, external Cu sources are needed to optimize the essential needs of aquatic animals. Inorganic, organic, and nano Cu forms are included in aquafeed and result in regulated physiological and biological functions. The addition of Cu should be added at particular doses considering the species, size, duration, and environmental conditions. Water-borne Cu level should also be considered as long as aquatic animals can obtain their requirements through gills to avoid overdosing and toxicity. Several studies reported the optimum doses of Cu required for optimal growth, productivity, and health status in several aquatic animals. This review article presents the up-to-date results of Cu-related studies in aquafeed. It also helps academia design further studies to better understand the border between Cu requirements and toxicity. Besides, planning for more studies involved in the understanding of the primary mode of action of Cu in aquatic animals’ entire bodies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s12011-021-03079-1

It is harvested in Mexico in small amounts for abalone farm fodder and occasionally exported to Asia for human consumption. Because the high-energy environment where it naturally grows limits its sustainable harvest, we explored the domestication and cultivation of this kelp on the west coast of Baja California, Mexico. The life history of E. arborea was completed in the laboratory following traditional methods for kelp cultivation. Gametophytes became reproductive approximately 50 days after spore release and sporophytes were visible to the naked eye after 80 days. When sporophytes reached 2–3 cm, they were transplanted to two sites on long-line systems: in an open bay (Todos Santos Bay) and in a shallow coastal lagoon (San Quintín Bay). At both sites, full differentiation occurred 6 to 8 months after deployment, with fertile blades occurring within a year. Once individuals reached maximum size, blades were harvested by pruning. Monthly, regrowth of pruned blades and new blade addition were measured. Pruned individuals reached the same weight as controls in three months. On the basis of these results, a seasonal seeding program was implemented at a third site where the presence of natural Eisenia is rare due to the lack of hard substrate but was hypothesized to provide appropriate conditions for kelp cultivation (Santa María Bay). Cultures were deployed at three different depths and growth was correlated with season, depth, and temperature. Only cultures seeded in winter developed successfully at this site. This study shows that the culture of E. arborea in a variety of ocean conditions is possible; however, site selection and seasonality are important considerations. Because E. arborea is perennial, it can be harvested periodically during the year thereby increasing yield, and because it is the warmest tolerant kelp species, it is an ideal target for ocean farming and commercial cultivation, considering climate change.

The aim of the study is to explore the effects and mechanisms of action of Ziyin Qianyang Formula (ZYQYF) on renal fibrosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Methods. Forty SHRs were randomly divided into a model group, Ziyin Qianyang Formula regular-dose and high-dose groups (ZYQYF-R, 20 g/kg; ZYQYF-H, 40 g/kg), and a western medicine group (enalapril 10 mg/kg), and 10 Sprague-Dawley rats were selected as the normal group. The rats received continuous gavage administration for 6 weeks and systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurements were obtained every fortnight. The serum levels of urea, serum creatinine (sCr), and uric acid (UA) were measured; the pathological morphology and collagen content of the kidneys were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Masson staining; and the serum Ang II level was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, Smad-2, Smad-3, and Smad-7 protein and mRNA expressions in kidney tissues was evaluated by western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results. The ZYQYF-H group showed significantly a lower renal weight and renal weight/body weight than the model group. The enalapril and ZYQYF-H groups showed significantly lower SBP than other groups after 6 weeks of administration. The ZYQYF-H group showed better improvement than the ZYQYF-R and enalapril groups in glomerular and tubular morphology and better reductions in inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen volumetric fraction. The ZYQYF-H group also showed better reductions in serum UA and Ang II levels; collagen-I, collagen-III, and p-Smad2/Smad-2 protein expression; and Smad-2 mRNA expression and a better increase in Smad-7 protein and mRNA expression than the enalapril group. Besides, the degree of renal function and fibrosis improvement was positively correlated with the dose of ZYQYF. Conclusion. ZYQYF can significantly reduce SHR blood pressure, protect renal function and structure, and improve renal fibrosis by regulating Smad proteins through TGF-β1.  © 2022 Hui Xu et al.",10.1155/2022/6088673
Zhang Q.; Huang J.; Yang C.; Chen J.; Wang W.,Transcriptomic responses to thermal stress in hybrid abalone (Haliotis discus hannai ♀ × H. fulgens ♂),2022,Frontiers in Genetics,13,,,,1053674,"China is the world’s largest abalone producing country. Currently, summer mortality caused by high temperature, is one of the biggest challenges for abalone aquaculture industry. The hybrid abalone (Haliotis discus hannai ♀ × H. fulgens ♂) was conferred on the “new variety”. It has heterosis for thermal tolerance and has been cultured at large-scale in southern China. In this study, a transcriptome analysis was performed to identify the related genes in this hybrid abalone under thermal stress and recovery stage. Compared to control group (18°C), a total of 75, 2173, 1050, 1349, 2548, 494, and 305 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at 21°C, 24°C, 27°C, 30°C, 32°C, 29°C, and 26°C, respectively. In this study, 24°C is the critical temperature at which the abalone is subjected to thermal stress. With the temperature rising, the number of stress-responsive genes increased. During the temperature recovering to the optimum, the number of stress-responsive genes decreased gradually. Thus, this hybrid abalone has a rapid response and strong adaptability to the temperature. Under the thermal stress, the abalone triggered a complicated regulatory network including degrading the misfolded proteins, activating immune systems, negative regulation of DNA replication, and activating energy production processes. The more quickly feedback regulation, more abundant energy supply and more powerful immune system might be the underlying mechanisms to fight against thermal stress in this hybrid abalone. These findings could provide clues for exploring the thermal-response mechanisms in abalone. The key genes and pathways would facilitate biomarker identification and thermal-tolerant abalone breeding studies. Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Huang, Yang, Chen and Wang.",10.3389/fgene.2022.1053674

The mucus from Helix aspersa snail is a mixture of bioactive molecules with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects. So far there are no data concerning the capacity of snail extract (SE) to affect neurodegenerative disorders. Objective: The effects of SE from Helix aspersa on learning and memory deficits in Alzheimer's type dementia (ATD) induced by scopolamine (Sco) in male Wistar rats were examined and some mechanisms of action underlying these effects were evaluated. Methods: SE (0.5 mL/100 g) was applied orally through a food tube for 16 consecutive days: 5 days before and 11 days simultaneously with Sco (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). At the end of Sco treatment, using behavioral methods, we evaluated memory performance. Additionally, in cortex and hippocampus the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, acetylcholine and monoamines (dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin) content, levels of main oxidative stress markers, and expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were determined. Results: We demonstrated that, according to all behavioral tests used, SE significantly improved the cognitive deficits induced by Sco. Furthermore, SE possessed AChE inhibitory activity, moderate antioxidant properties and the ability to modulate monoamines content in two brain structures. Moreover, multiple SE applications not only restored the depressed by Sco expression of CREB and BDNF, but significantly upregulated it. Conclusion: Summarizing results, we conclude that complex mechanisms underlie the beneficial effects of SE on impaired memory in Alzheimer's type dementia.  © 2022-IOS Press.

In this work, the anisotropic microscopic deformation and the resulting macroscopic mechanical properties are evaluated under different loading conditions. Our in situ transmission electron microscopy deformation experiments and finite element simulations reveal that nacre possesses enhanced indentation resistance along the direction normal to the tablets through delocalization of indentation-induced deformation by taking advantage of its layered structure. In addition, nacre's ability to recover from large deformations is observed. We study the strong loading direction dependence of nacre's macroscopic mechanical properties and elucidate the underlying microscopic deformation patterns in the tablets and the soft matrix. Particularly, its performance along the transverse direction is optimized to withstand the loading conditions in nature. We show the importance of the vertical matrix for the initial stiffness and fracture toughness of the composite. These findings provide guidelines for designing nacre-inspired artificial composites with enhanced mechanical properties. Statement of significance: Nacre is widely recognized as an excellent structural model for designing bio-inspired tough and strong artificial composites. Due to its brick-and-mortar microstructure, it exhibits loading direction-dependent mechanical behavior. In this contribution, we investigate the macroscopic mechanical properties and microscopic deformation behavior of nacre under different loading conditions by means of in situ TEM deformation tests and FE simulations. It is found that effective elastic moduli and microscopic deformation strongly depend on the loading direction. The organic matrix is highly deformable. The indentation resistance along the direction normal to tablets is enhanced via deformation delocalization. Our quantitative and qualitative results provide guidelines on optimizing the mechanical properties of nacre-inspired novel composites. © 2022",10.1016/j.actbio.2022.05.033

Serial depletion of pāua (abalone, Haliotis iris), a cultural keystone for Māori in Aotearoa New Zealand, threatens Indigenous practices and values. Kāti Huirapa Rūnaka ki Puketeraki, a hapū (subtribe) of Ngāi Tahu, have struggled for over 30 years to address loss of local pāua populations. Regulations introduced by the East Otago Taiāpure, a customary fishery management area established in 1999, recognise Indigenous rights to access and manage marine resources. Despite concerted efforts to rebuild pāua populations while allowing fishing, pāua have continued to decline and the fishery was closed in 2019. A wealth of mātauranga (Māori knowledge) surrounds enhancement practices for pāua. Here, mātauranga relating to translocation was collated through interviews and applied, in conjunction with additional knowledge bases, to translocate pāua from reefs threatened by sand inundation to more accessible but historically overexploited bays. In total, 420 pāua, translocated across 21 sites, were monitored for a 2-week period, after which aggregations returned to pretranslocation densities. Total mortality reached 8.8% over this time, attributed primarily to predation by the sea star Astrostole scabra. Results suggest that translocation may not be suitable for creating artificial aggregations using the methods applied; however, it could address other management concerns, hence suggestions are made for methodological improvements. The interaction between pāua and A. scabra demonstrates the need for continued transformation in management to allow for the application of a multispecies integrated approach in the restoration of pāua. © 2021 CSIRO.",10.1071/PC20058

The crude fat of abalone visceral was taken as raw material, and crude phospholipids were extracted with acetone, and then according to the principle that the solubility of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in lower alcohols is higher than that of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), the crude phospholipids were further separated and concentrated with ethanol to obtain purer phospholipids. According to the results of univariate test, the volume fraction of ethanol, the extraction time of ethanol and the material-liquid ratio of crude phospholipid to ethanol were selected as the indexes, and the mathematical regression model of phospholipid yield to ethanol concentration, extraction time, and material-liquid ratio of crude phospholipid to ethanol was designed in orthogonal experiments, and the optimal process conditions were as follows: the liquid-material ratio of acetone to crude fat of abalone visceral crude fat during the preparation of crude phospholipids was 9 ∶ 1, the number of extractions was three times, and the extraction time of acetone was 40 min. During the purification of phospholipids, the volume fraction of ethanol was 92%, the extraction time was 41 min, and the ratio of ethanol to crude phospholipids was 10 ∶1, under these conditions, the yield of phospholipids in internal organs could reach (28. 72±0. 68)%. The determination of the antioxidant capacity of abalone visceral phospholipids showed that the reducing power, hydroxyl free radical scavenging ability and DPPH scavenging ability of abalone visceral phospholipids were enhanced with the increase of abalone visceral phospholipid concentration, and abalone visceral phospholipids had certain antioxidant effects in soybean oil and rapeseed oil, among which in rapeseed oil, when the addition amount of phospholipid reached 0. 5%, its antioxidant effect on oil was similar to that of 0. 02% TBHQ added, showing a certain antioxidant capacity.

Using a video surveillance system, the current study showed that the feeding behaviors of DD and DF exhibited an obvious circadian rhythm, with significantly more feeding at night by DD and DF than during the day. In addition, the amount of time feeding by DF during the day and at night was significantly higher compared with that of DD, especially at ZT8 (20:00), ZT12 (24:00), ZT16 (04:00), and ZT20 (08:00), with the proportion of time feeding by DF increasing 2.22-, 1.60-, 2.71-, and 2.40-fold compared with those of DD, respectively. The maximum values of pepsase activity in DD and DF, of α-amylase activity in DD, and of alginate lyase activity in DF coincided with the peak feeding period. Relative to the changes in expression levels of neuropeptide Y receptor (NPYR) in the intestine, diurnal changes in NPYR expression levels in cerebral ganglia were consistent with the changes in feeding behavior, being highest at 24:00 h in both DD and DF and then declining. There was no significant difference in the circadian expression levels of cholecystokinin receptor (CCKR) in the cerebral ganglia, whereas, in the intestinal tract, peak CCKR expression levels coincided with its anorexigenic effect; the expression levels of CCKR in the intestinal tract exhibited a significant circadian rhythm in DD. These results explain the growth advantage of DF over DD in terms of feeding behavior and digestive physiology, and support the hypothesis that diurnal changes in feeding-related genes in the nervous and digestive systems are correlated with the initiation of abalone feeding behavior. Our findings also provide guidance for developing a suitable feeding strategy for, and improving the efficiency of, the production of abalone. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738158
Desai A.S.; Reddy V.K.,Seaweeds derived by-products,2023,Applications of Seaweeds in Food and Nutrition,,,225,234,,"In terms of volume, farmed seaweeds in 2018 made up 97.1% of the combined 32.4 million tonnes of wild-collected and cultivated aquatic algae. A comparatively small number of nations, mostly those in East and Southeast Asia, practice seaweed farming. Between 2000 and 2018, the global output of marine macroalgae, sometimes known as seaweed, increased by more than thrice, from 10.6 million tonnes to 32.4 million tonnes. The trade of seaweeds in 2018 was of USD 2 billion. Seaweeds dominate aquacultured aquatic algae, which have shown very slow growth in recent years. Some of the 32.4 million tonnes of farmed seaweed produced in 2018 (such as Undaria pinnatifida, Porphyra spp., and Caulerpa spp., produced in East and Southeast Asia) are produced primarily for human consumption, though low-quality products and factory scraps are used for other things, such as abalone culture feed. In fact, seaweed production decreased by 0.7% in 2018. This shift was mostly brought on by Southeast Asia's decreased production and the slow growth of tropical seaweed species, while the production of temperate and coldwater species from seaweed farming was still increasing. The major factor behind the rise in farmed seaweed production over the past 10years, despite a recent slowdown in growth rates, has been the rapid expansion of the farming of tropical seaweed species in Indonesia (Kappaphycus alvarezii and Eucheuma spp.) as a source of raw materials for the extraction of carrageenan. From less than four million tonnes in 2010 to over 11 million tonnes in 2015 and 2016, with comparable production levels in 2017 and 2018, Indonesia boosted its seaweed farming output. Due to secrecy, only a few producing nations in Europe and North America have reported much information on small-scale seaweed growing. To promote and monitor the development of a bioeconomy that is climate and environmentally sustainable, seaweed farming is nevertheless receiving more and more attention. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

As the oceans and atmosphere exchange gases, the pH of seawater decreases. According to the IPCC, if CO2 emissions are not effectively reduced, the global surface seawater pH will fall to 7.7 by the 21st century and 7.4 by 2300. Acidification is a growing concern because of the damage it can cause to marine life. In addition, ocean acidification often does not occur in isolation, but often acts on marine life in concert with other stressors. Deltamethrin is one of the most widely used pyrethroid insecticides in the world because of its high activity and photostability to pests. Pyrethroid pesticides have little potential to pollute the environment, but they can enter organisms through the food chain and produce toxicity to aquatic organisms. Previously, pyrethroid residues of 6.36μg/L and 16.2μg/L were detected in coastal areas of Fujian and Zhejiang, respectively. At present, studies on deltamethrin toxicity to aquatic organisms mainly focus on acute and subacute toxicity tests of fish and shrimp, but few studies on shellfish. In order to investigate the toxic effects of seawater acidification and deltamethrin (DM) combined exposure on juvenile of Haliotis discus hannai, three pH values (pH 8.1, pH 7.7 and pH 7.4) and three deltamethrin concentrations (0, 0.6 and 6.0 μg/L) were used to stress juvenile of H. discus hannai. The microstructures and hardness of the shlls, the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the expression levels of genes related to stress and apoptosis in the tissues of juvenile of H. discus hannai were detected. The results showed that after the combined exposure of seawater acidification and deltamethrin for 31 days, the CaCO3 crystal deposition of juvenile abalone shells was difficult, the aragonite became smaller and formed scattered lamellar stacking, the pores between the aragonite increased, and the hardness of the shells decreased significantly. Meanwhile, seawater acidification and deltamethrin could change the activity of antioxidant enzymes in juvenile abalone. When the pH of seawater was 7.7 and 7.4 or the concentration of deltamethrin was 0.6 and 6, the SOD activity of juvenile abalone was lower than that of the control group, and the SOD activity of juvenile abalone under the combined exposure of seawater acidification and deltamethrin was significantly lower than that of single exposure, indicating that there was an obvious interaction between seawater acidification and deltamethrin on the SOD activity of juvenile abalone. However, deltamethrin significantly increased the activities of CAT and GST in juvenile abalone under the same pH exposure. In addition, this study also observed that the expression levels of stress genes and apoptotic genes in the tissues of juvenile abalone were increased with the increase of pCO2 and deltamethrin concentration, and there was a significant synergistic effect between seawater acidification and deltamethrin exposure on the expression levels of HSP70, HSP90, Caspase-3 and FADD. In conclusion, seawater acidification and deltamethrin exposure can produce significant toxic effects on juvenile abalone and play a certain interactive role in the reaction of tissue oxidative stress and cell apoptosis in juvenile abalone. © 2022 Shanghai Ocean University.

Anti-Freeze Proteins (AFPs) have been acknowledged to have positive effects on the survival of oocytes, embryos and ovaries during cryopreservation. AFPs drop the freezing point beneath the balance point of melting by binding ice crystals; restricting their expansion and recrystallization. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of AFP I and III separately or in combination on the vitrification and warming procedures of ovarian tissues which were vitrified for one week and one month. Ovaries were obtained from rats and randomly assigned to four groups according to the AFP supplements in the media used during freeze/warm procedures: 1) control group (medium without AFP); 2) AFP I; 3) AFP III; 4) AFP I + AFP III groups. The groups were further organized according to the duration of vitrification, 1 week or 1 month. Ovaries were evaluated morphologically by a grading system, TUNEL assay and by transmission electron microscopy. AFP supplementation decreased apoptosis and follicular damage. Supplementation of AFP type I and type III has cryoprotective roles in ovaries which were vitrified for 1 week and 1 month. Additionally, AFP I+AFP III supplementation were shown to have more protection in long term. © 2021, Veteriner Fakultesi Dergisi. All rights reserved.",10.9775/KVFD.2021.25952

Four artificial diets were designed with 0 (artificial diet control), 7.5, 15.0 and 22.5 mg/kg of APSH-07, respectively. The brown alga Laminaria japonica was used as the live food control. Results showed that the specific growth rates of abalone in the groups with 7.5 and 15.0 mg/kg dietary APSH-07 were significantly higher than those in the controls (p '.05). The total haemocyte counts and respiratory burst activity in haemolymph of abalone in the group with 7.5 mg/kg of dietary APSH-07 were significantly higher than those in the groups with 0 and 22.5 mg/kg of dietary APSH-07 (p '.05). The gene expression levels of Mn-superoxide dismutase and thioredoxin peroxidase 2, and the activities of glutathione peroxidase in the group with 7.5 mg/kg of dietary APSH-07 were significantly higher than those in the other groups (p '.05). Cumulative mortality of abalone after the challenge test was significantly decreased in the group with 7.5 mg/kg of dietary APSH-07 supplementation. Supplementation of 22.5 mg/kg dietary APSH-07 significantly increased the cumulative mortality. In conclusion, 7.5 mg/kg of dietary APSH-07 supplementation had the better growth performance, higher antioxidation, immune and disease resistance capacity of abalone. Excessive supplementation of dietary antimicrobial peptide APSH-07 (22.5 mg/kg) had significantly negative effects.

Samples of abalone were collected both in autumn and winter in Flinders Bay, Augusta, Western Australia, and land transported for 6 (six) hours. Several immunological parameters were assessed, including survival rate, total haemocyte count, osmoregulatory capacity, phagocytic rate, lactate level, and glucose level. The results indicated that the abalone samples collected in the two seasons showed different physiological responses; the winter samples were more responsive to transportation than the autumn samples. Transportation stress significantly increased total haemocyte count and osmoregulatory capacity of the winter samples, suggesting an immune stimulation. This stress also triggered an immune suppression, causing the phagocytic rate and lysosomal stability to significantly decrease after transportation. Lactate levels in the winter samples decreased significantly after transportation, possibly indicating the transition from a stressed to normal state, during the period of recovery. The constant level of glucose before and after transportation in both seasons showed that it was the least sensitive indicator used in this study. In general, there was no difference in the immune modulation parameters between wild and ranched abalone in either of the seasons sampled. However, in the autumn samples, there were significant differences (P<0.05) in haemocyte count and osmoregulatory capacity of the wild and ranched samples collected from all sites. These differences did not form a consistent indicator trend between the sites from the two sample sources. Therefore, the results do not raise any immediate concern that ranched abalone were differently stressed to those from the wild. The results in present study could serve as useful data in developing the live transportation method of greenlip abalone. © 2020, Indonesian Aquaculture Journal.",

Marine biota selected from various trophic levels were collected in Korean coastal waters throughout 2014 and 2015 and their plutonium levels were measured to evaluate the radioactive contamination levels in the marine organisms that constitute the primary seafood diet in the Republic of Korea (ROK). The results showed that the activity concentrations of 239,240Pu in plankton, macroalgae, mollusks, crustaceans, and cephalopods ranged from 13 to 58, 0.64 to 0.80, 0.94 to 5.40, 0.06 to 0.50, and 0.26 mBq kg−1 of wet weight (w.w.), respectively. The activity concentrations of 239,240Pu measured in the muscles of fish varied from 0.09 to 0.30 mBq kg−1 (w.w.), relatively low values compared to those in other groups regardless of fish species, size, and sampling area. The concentration characteristics of 239,240Pu in the various organs in the respective marine products revealed that the internal organs showed higher concentrations than the muscle or skin (or exoskeleton). The highest concentration of 239,240Pu was measured in the viscera of an abalone, which had an activity concentration of 6.31 mBq kg−1 (w.w.). The concentration factors (CFs) in the >300-μm fraction of plankton and in anchovy, shrimp, and mackerel ranged 67–84% of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)-recommended values, although the CF in macroalgae was much lower at approximately 5% of IAEA values, suggesting a wide range of 239,240Pu CF in macroalgae. The mean transfer factor (TF) between macroalgae (0.6–0.8 mBq kg−1) and abalone (5.4 mBq kg−1) was estimated to be 7.5, implying that effective Pu transfer occurred between the two species. These figures equate to annual effective doses of 239,240Pu to Koreans through consumption of macroalgae, shellfish, and fish of 1.8 × 10−6, 1.4 × 10−6, and 7.1 × 10−7 mSv yr−1, respectively, and a total dose of 3.9 × 10−6 mSv yr−1, values that are negligible compared to the annual effective dose limit of 1 mSv yr−1. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jenvrad.2020.106191

Therefore, in this study, we investigated anti-adipogenic effects of αAL14 on preadipocyte, 3T3-L1. Obesity is an imbalance in metabolism caused by excessive energy intake or reduced energy consumption, and fat accumulates in the body, which causes chronic disease such as high pressure, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Inhibition of adipogenesis has been focused on as a strategy for treating metabolic disease including diabetes and obesity. In order to confirm the effect on adipocyte differentiation, αAL14 was treated while inducing differentiation from preadipocytes into mature adipocytes. We observed that αAL14 potently and dose-dependently suppressed accumulation of lipid droplets during mature adipocyte differentiation. αAL14 also down-regulated the expression of key adipogenic regulator such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR γ), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBP α) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1). In addition, αAL14 diminished the insulin-stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling and its downstream factors that promote adipogenesis by inducing the expression of PPAR γ, such as mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) and forkhead box (Fox) transcription factors, which may reduce glucose uptake in response to insulin and lipid accumulation. These results indicated that αAL14 suppresses adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation depending on multiple mechanisms. In summary, αAL14 could be a novel inhibitor of adipogenesis and may have applications for the treatment of obesity.

This study evaluates the impact of macroalgal diets and water temperatures on the colour and tissue pigment deposition in farmed greenlip abalone. Three diets are (a) fresh Ulva sp., (b) a commercial diet and (c) a formulated diet of 30% of dried Ulva sp. meal supplement were used to feed 3-year-old greenlip abalone at either 22 or 26°C for 38 days. Abalone fed 30% dried Ulva sp. meal supplement had significantly higher the shell colour saturation than those fed fresh Ulva sp. The lip colour was deeper in abalone fed fresh Ulva sp. and was significantly more pronounced than those fed the diet containing 30% Ulva sp. meal. Abalone at 22°C had a significantly higher lip colour saturation value than those at 26°C. The foot of abalone fed fresh Ulva sp. was light gold, whereas abalone fed the 30% Ulva sp. meal or the commercial diet had a dark brown foot at 22°C. The foot colour was paler in abalone at 26°C than at 22°C. The content of β-carotene was significantly higher in abalone fed fresh Ulva sp. than those fed the other diets. Abalone contained a higher amount of β-carotene at 22°C than at 26°C. This study indicates that high water temperatures make foot colour paler and the fresh Ulva sp. diet can make the foot colour lighter at 22°C. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/are.14855

This is considered a potential toxicological threat to marine species due to the chemical additives used to make many plastic products, or the persistent organic pollutants that may accumulate on them while residing in the environment. While the presence of MPs in the marine environment is widely documented, there are no other review articles providing a summary of published effect studies of MPs on the immune and reproductive systems of marine species. This manuscript reviews reproductive and immune-system changes in response to MPs in 7 and 9 species, respectively. Some species such as Mytilus galloprovincialis and oyster Crassostrea gigas were investigated in multiple papers. Most studies have been conducted on invertebrates, and only 3 studies have been performed on vertebrates, with exposure times ranging between 30 min and 60 days. A review of the literature revealed that the most common MPs types studied in relation to adverse impacts on immune system and reproductive success in marine species were polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE). The immune system's responses to MPs exposure varied depending on the species, with altered organismal defense mechanisms and neutrophil function observed in fish and changes in lysosomal membrane stability and apoptotic-like nuclear alterations in phagocytes reported in invertebrate species. Reproductive responses to MPs exposure, varied depending on species, but included significant reduction in gamete and oocyte quality, fecundity, sperm swimming speed, and quality of offspring. The lack of published data means that developing a clear understanding of the impact across taxonomic groups with different feeding and behavioral traits is often difficult. Further work is required to better understand the risk MPs pose to the immune and reproductive systems of marine species in order to fully evaluate the impact these ubiquitous pollutants are having on marine ecosystems and the associated goods and services they provide. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111109

The larval rearing technique of abalone has produced successfully at Gondol Research and Development Institute for Mariculture, Bali, Indonesia. However, the grow-out of abalone has not well documented yet. The purpose of this experiment is to examine the shelter shape in relation to growth and survival for abalone (Haliotis squamata) grow-out culture in the tidal area. The shelter made from PVC piping. The shape of shelter as a treatment of this experiment was A) round; B) square and; C) without shelter. The data of growth and survival rate were analyzed using analysis of variance. The result showed that the shelter for the grow-out of abalone was significantly affected growth in terms of shell length and wet weight (P<0.05) while the survival did not influence (P>0.05). It seems that the shelter was correlated with the feeding behavior of abalone had resulted in different for their growing. The water quality such as salinity, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, and water current was within the optimal range for abalone. We found that round shelter shape is the best for grow-out abalone at the tidal area. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",10.1088/1755-1315/441/1/012001

The process of shell biomineralization is controlled by genes and proteins expressed within the mantle epithelium. In this present paper, we conducted a shell regeneration experiment to study the role of HcCNA and HcCNB (individual subunits of calcineurin) in shell biomineralization in H. diversicolor. The results of qPCR showed that HcCNB is upregulated to a greater extent than HcCNA in the mantle after shell notching. In vivo study of the effects of rHcCNB injection showed a significantly higher percentage of regenerated shell length, but not area, in the injected group compared to the control group. In addition, SEM observation of the inner surface of the regenerated shells revealed three different zones including prismatic, nacreous, and a distinct transition zone. Changes in the crystal organization and ultrastructure are clearly evident in these three zones, particularly after 3 weeks of rHcCNB administration. We hypothesize that this is due to faster biomineralization rates in the rHcCNB treated group. Taken together, our results demonstrate that HcCNB participates in shell regeneration in H. diversicolor. As calcineurin subunits have also been implicated in shell formation in bivalves, these findings suggest that calcineurin subunits may play important roles in biomineralization in all conchiferans. © 2021 Buddawong et al.",10.7717/peerj.10662

The parameters observed in in this study are the chemical composition of the tissue of abalone and the relative growth. The results indicated that the formulated feed did not significantly affect the growth rate, survival rate, and chemical composition of tropical abalone reared in the marine submersible cages (P>0.05). However, the growth and survival rate of the abalone had a high percentage. Different percentages in marine algae supplementation contributed to similar reponse regarding growth rate, survival rate and chemical composition of the soft tissue of tropical abalone.

To explore the potential roles of invertebrate IKKs on immunity, three IKK encoding genes have been identified from molluscan species disk abalone and designed as AbIKK1, AbIKK2 and AbIKK3 at the transcriptional level. Coding sequences of AbIKK1, AbIKK2 and AbIKK3 encode the peptides of 746, 751 and 713 amino acids with the predicted molecular mass of 86.16, 86.12 and 81.88 kDa respectively. All three AbIKKs were found to share conserved IKK family features including the kinase superfamily domain (KD), ubiquitin-like domain (ULD), and α-helical scaffold/dimerization domain (SDD), similar to their mammalian counterparts. Under normal physiological conditions, AbIKKs were ubiquitously detected in six different tissues, with the highest abundance in the digestive tract and gills. Temporal transcriptional profiles in abalone hemocytes revealed the induction of AbIKK1, AbIKK2, and AbIKK3 expression following exposure to Gram-negative (Vibrio parahemolyticus) and Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes) bacteria, viruses (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, VHSV), LPS, or poly I:C. The overexpression of AbIKKs in HEK293T or RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells induced NF-κB promoter activation independent of stimulation by TNF-α or LPS. Moreover, iNOS and COX2 expression was induced in AbIKK transfected RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells and the induced state was maintained post-LPS treatment. Furthermore, mRNA levels of three selected cytokine-encoding genes (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) were found to be elevated in abalone IKK overexpressed RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells, both with and without LPS exposure. Overall, our findings demonstrated that AbIKKs identified in this study were positively involved in eliciting innate immune responses in abalone. In addition, the data revealed the presence of an evolutionarily conserved signaling mechanism for IKK mediated NF-κB activation in mollusks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.fsi.2020.04.029

Abalones (initial weight: 10.98 ± 0.05 g) were fed with graded levels of dietary lipid (1.57%, 2.34%, 3.17%, 3.82%, 4.63%, 5.56%, 6.17% and 6.72%). Results showed that weight gain rate (WGR) and increment in shell length of abalone were highest in 3.82% dietary lipid level. Based on the quadratic regression analysis for WGR, the optimal dietary lipid level for abalone was estimated to be 3.87%. Concentrations of the total triacylglycerol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-esterified fatty acids in serum as well as lipid contents in hepatopancreas and muscle were positively related to dietary lipid levels. Compared to the group with 3.82% of dietary lipid, higher (6.72%) and lower (1.57%) dietary lipid down regulated the expression of genes involved in fatty acids transport and lipolysis in hepatopancreas and muscle, which might be related to AMP-activated protein kinase α2 (AMPKα2)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) signaling. Higher dietary lipid (6.72%) down regulated, while lower dietary lipid (1.57%) up-regulated the expressions of genes involved in de-novo lipogenesis in hepatopancreas. Both higher (6.72%) and lower (1.57%) dietary lipid down regulated these genes' expression in muscle. It was found that c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) signaling participate in the regulation of de-novo lipogenesis. In conclusion, lipid deposition in abalone was affected by dietary lipid levels through AMPKα2/PPARα and JNK/mTOR/SREBP-1c pathway. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.736040

Three separate trials of an experiment were conducted by exposing juvenile C. concholepas for 1 month to one of two contrasting pCO2 levels (~500 and ~1200 μatm). In addition, each pCO2 level was combined with one of four temperature treatments. The control was 15 °C, whilst the other temperatures were 10 °C (Trial 1), 20 °C (Trial 2) and 25 °C (Trial 3). At the end of each trial, we assessed Critical Thermal maximum (CTmax) and minimum (CTmin) via self-righting success, calculated partial thermal tolerance polygons, measured somatic growth, determined transcription of Heat Shock Proteins 70 (HSP70) and measured oxygen consumption rates. Regardless of pCO2 level, HSP70 transcript levels were significantly higher in juveniles after exposure to extreme temperatures (10 °C and 25 °C) indicating physiological stress. Oxygen consumption rates increased with increasing temperature from 10 °C to 20 °C though showed a decrease at 25 °C. This rate was not affected by pCO2 or the interaction between temperature and pCO2. Juveniles exposed to present-day and near future pCO2 levels at 20 °C showed similar thermal tolerance polygonal areas; whilst changes in both CTmin and CTmax at 25 °C and 10 °C caused narrower and broader areas, respectively. Temperature affected growth, oxygen consumption and HSP70 transcription in small juvenile C. concholepas. Exposure to elevated pCO2 did not affect thermal tolerance, growth or oxygen consumption at temperatures within the thermal range normally experienced by this species in northern Chile (15-20 °C). At elevated pCO2 conditions, however, exposure to warmer (25 °C) or colder (10 °C) temperatures reduced or increased the thermal area, respectively. This study demonstrates the importance of examining the thermal-tolerance edges to better understand how OA and temperature will combine to physiologically challenge inter-tidal organisms. © 2020",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137239
Zakaria Z.; Abd Rasib N.A.; Tompang M.F.,Spent mushroom substrate based fish feed affects the growth of catfish (Clarias gariepinus),2021,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,765,1,,,12082,"A preliminary study was conducted to identify the effect of Spent Mushroom Substrate (SMS), a biomass from mushroom cultivation, towards catfish growth and intake performance when developed into fish feed. The fish experiment on catfish was conducted up to 12 weeks and analyzed on the weight, length size, survival rate and digestibility for the three types of SMS based feed in pellet form and a commercial pellet that applied for ten catfish each. Among the SMS based fish feed, Ganoderma obtained the highest weight of 32.46 g followed by White (30.71 g) and Abalone (17.74 g). For the length size, Ganoderma, White and Abalone SMS based feed had achieved in average 18.05 cm, 17.12 cm and 14.85 cm respectively. Commercial feed still manage to obtain the highest weight and length size as 39.33 g and 20.83 cm respectively. The survival rate was found 30 % higher in SMS based feed compared to commercial feed. The digestibility study of dry matter for Ganoderma, White and Abalone SMS based feed were found 77.34 %, 78.20 %, 77.76 % respectively whereas for commercial pellet was 60.92 % indicates that SMS based feed was consumed and digested better than commercial feed. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Abalone is one of Indonesian marine resources with great potential to be developed. The high demand for abalone is usually not met with enough supplies, resulting in its expensive price. Sources are scattered and in remote locations, creating the need for marketing institutions. The study took place in Bajo Bahari village (Buton regency) and Baubau (a city in Southeast Sulawesi), Indonesia. The data was initially collected in February to May 2015, and later in March 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. The study consists of all 30 Bajo Bahari abalone fishermen. Additionally, 5 abalone merchants were chosen using snowball sampling method; which consists of 3 village abalone collector (VAC) and 2 wholesalers who act as the inter-island abalone trader (IAT). The abalone marketing performance was analyzed through the marketing margin and the fishermen's share, by first identifying the marketing channels. Results show two marketing channels were created, channel I (fishermen as producers→VAC→IAT) and channel II (fishermen as producers→IAT). Channel II showed better performance compared to channel I. Channel II had lower marketing margin (IDR 58,333) and high fishermen’s share, 72%. In contrast, channel I showed higher marketing margin (IDR 127,778) and low fishermen’s share, 16%. The Covid-19 pandemic poses challenges to the local abalone marketing, where fishing activities are stopped and disrupted the overall abalone marketing in Buton Island. © 2020, BIOFLUX SRL.

This study was proposed to evaluate the feeding preference (feed response and feed intake) and the growth performance of early adult H. squamata on some macroalgae. Seven species of macroalgae were evaluated as unpair feeding choice and the experiment design employed was completely randomized design. The results showed that H. squamata responded variously to the seven macroalgae species and the food deprivation (fasting) data showed mounting response to all macroalgae. Ulva lactuca and Enteromorpha sp. were the most responded which up to four times higher compared to the least responded i.e. Halymenia sp. and Sargassum sp. The highest to the lowest palatable feed intake (FI) were Gracillaria sp, Eucheuma spinosum, Ulva lactuca, Halymenia sp., Enteromorpha sp., Sargassum sp. and Hypnea sp. respectively. The first four palatable macroalgae resulted in various growth responses of H. squamata. Except for Halymenia sp., the feed intake (FI) rate showed an opposite linear correlation to growth response and FCR. The daily growth rate (g/day) was Ulva lactuca (0.104), Enteropmorpha sp.

The energy budgets of abalone fed live macroalgae (Ulva sp. or Gracilaria cliftonii) and an equal mix of those two macroalgae species with and without nutrient enrichment, or one of three control formulated commercial diets, at 22°C for 93 days were investigated. Among non-enriched algal treatments, abalone fed G. cliftonii and mixed diet treatments had significantly higher ingested feed energy and absorbed energy than those fed Ulva sp. Abalone fed non-enriched G. cliftonii invested significantly more energy into somatic growth than those fed Ulva sp. and the mixed diet treatment. For diets with nutrient enrichment, ingested feed energy and absorbed energy rate of abalone fed G. cliftonii and mixed diet treatments were significantly higher than those fed Ulva sp. Nutrient enrichment increased crude protein in live macroalgae, and ammonia excretion energy rate was higher for abalone fed enriched macroalgae compared to non-enriched. Abalone fed the control commercial diets spent more energy in all components compared to those fed the live macroalgae treatments. The major component of the energy budgets in abalone fed the commercial diets and live macroalgae diets was somatic growth energy, ranging from 25.5% to 37.7% of ingested feed energy, except for abalone fed live Ulva sp. where the major component was respiration energy (38.5%). Overall, abalone fed the formulated diets or live non-enriched G. cliftonii could increase ingested feed energy, absorbed energy and somatic growth energy. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/are.14832

Five and six experimental diets containing crude protein level from 20% to 40% and 20% to 45% with 5% increment of protein level for the small and large abalone were prepared and referred to as the CP20, CP25, CP30, CP35, CP40, and CP45 diets, respectively. The experimental diets were fed to abalone for 16 weeks in Trials 1 and 2. Specific growth rate (SGR) of the small abalone fed the CP20 diet was lower compared to that of abalone fed all other diets in Trial 1. Growth performance (weight gain and SGR) of the large abalone fed the CP30, CP35, and CP40 diets were greater than that of abalone fed the CP20, CP25, and CP45 diets in Trial 2.

This resilience is one of the reasons why this species is such an interesting model for studying processes such as the immune response. In this work, we stimulated mussel hemocytes with poly I:C, β-glucans, and LPS and then sequenced hemocyte mRNAs (transcriptome) and microRNAs (miRNome) to investigate the molecular basis of the innate immune responses against these pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). An immune transcriptome comprising 219,765 transcripts and an overview of the mussel miRNome based on 5,175,567 non-redundant miRNA reads were obtained. The expression analyses showed opposite results in the transcriptome and miRNome; LPS was the stimulus that triggered the highest transcriptomic response, with 648 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), while poly I:C was the stimulus that triggered the highest miRNA response, with 240 DE miRNAs. Our results reveal a powerful immune response to LPS as well as activation of certain immunometabolism- and ageing/senescence-related processes in response to all the immune challenges. Poly I:C exhibited powerful stimulating properties in mussels, since it triggered the highest miRNomic response and modulated important genes related to energy demand; these effects could be related to the stronger activation of these hemocytes (increased phagocytosis, increased NO synthesis, and increased velocity and accumulated distance). The transcriptome results suggest that after LPS stimulation, pathogen recognition, homeostasis and cell survival processes were activated, and phagocytosis was induced by LPS. β-glucans elicited a response related to cholesterol metabolism, which is important during the immune response, and it was the only stimulus that induced the synthesis of ROS. These results suggest a specific and distinct response of hemocytes to each stimulus from a transcriptomic, miRNomic, and functional point of view. © Copyright © 2020 Moreira, Romero, Rey-Campos, Pereiro, Rosani, Novoa and Figueras.",10.3389/fimmu.2020.606102

The protein, carbohydrate, lipid, and ash contents of abalone muscle were 15.87, 6.36, 0.22, and 1.36 g/100 g, respectively. Most of the carbohydrates in the abalone muscle were released easily into water, and potassium was the most abundant mineral. WF and SP were rich in essential and umami amino acids, and all three fractions had high arginine contents. The essential amino acid index and predicted biological value of WF were 75.84 and 90.96, respectively. These values were considerably higher than those of MP and SP. Meanwhile, the predicted protein efficiency ratio of MP was the highest. Lysine was the first limiting essential amino acid (EAA) in MP and SP, and the score of the first limiting EAA (tryptophan) in WF was more than 100%. The in vitro protein digestibility of WF and SP was approximately 92% higher than that of MP. The in vivo experiments showed that WF was the easiest to digest. The nutritional value and high digestibility of WF can be claimed as a high-quality protein source based on the current findings. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.foodres.2019.108876

Jwa M.-S.; Hong C.-Y.,Physiological responses of intrinsic small abalone haliotis diversicolor aquatilis under high temperature stress by low level60co gamma irradiation-mediated hormetic effect,2020,Journal of Marine Science and Engineering,8,11,1,11,906,"Haliotis diversicolor aquatilis (H. diversicolor aquatilis) is one of the aquaculture abalone species in Jeju Island, South Korea. The high water temperature in the middle of the summer season frequently limits the aquaculture productivity of abalone. To cope with the problem, this study aimed to investigate viability, attachment rate, changes of immune response, and physiological properties of juvenile small abalone Haliotis diversicolor aquatilis against high water temperature stress under60CO-gamma irradiation-mediated hormetic effects. To examine physiological changes of abalone, the gamma-ray irradiated and non-irradiated groups were distinguished by grouping a total of 70 abalones in a treated group and a control group (each group included twenty-five female and ten male abalones). The treated group was exposed to60CO-gamma irradiation using a designed experimental apparatus, the control group was not. Our results revealed that the low level of gamma ray (20 Gy)-irradiated Haliotis diversicolor aquatilis showed a 100% survival rate during the experiment. After gamma ray exposure, all the abalones were cultured without feeding and bioactivities were measured to examine gamma ray-induced physiological responses. The results suggested the potential for selective breeding using gamma ray irradiation hormesis to manipulate the number of eggs, fertilization rate, hatching rate, and attachment rate. The shell length of juvenile abalone was significantly enhanced by a 20 Gy radiation dose. We could presume that the effect of hormesis in the gamma-ray irradiation parent shellfish also had a genetic effect on the offspring. In order to verify changes in immune response and stress tolerance of abalone under high temperature stress, lysozyme activity and survival rates were compared at a water temperature of 30◦C. Interestingly, the60Co gamma ray-irradiated abalones exhibited almost a 1.65-fold enhanced survival rate along with reduced lysozyme activity after 12 h of high temperature stress. Our results speculate that low levels of60Co gamma ray-mediated hormetic effects can be an effective strategy for shell length growth and high temperature stress tolerance. © 2020 by the authors.

Results indicate that U. armoricana is an important dietary ingredient for gonad production, accounting for an average of 37.33 ± 1.03% of the isotopic signal recorded for gonads at the end of the growth trial. This is significantly more than fish meal and soya, which only contributed an average of 11.40 ± 1.81 and 3.80 ± 0.09%, respectively, of the isotopic signal of the gonads. Maize and wheat each account for almost 25% of all the dietary ingredients used to formulate the feeds, but their relative contribution to gonad production only averaged 8.55 ± 0.58 and 3.80 ± 0.05%, respectively, among the diets. This indicates that, at least for gonad development, these ingredients may not be required at such high levels. These findings support previous data on the importance of Ulva in abalone and urchin diets, and demonstrate the value of stable isotope analysis for assessing the contribution of specific dietary ingredients in new feed formulations, particularly where growth of specific tissues is being investigated. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/anu.12979

However, their interaction with the environment and their toxicity in aquatic animals is still a matter of intense debate. In this review on PAEs in aquatic environments (lakes, rivers and seas), it is found that there is a large variety and abundance of PAEs in developing countries, and the total concentration of PAEs even exceeds 200 μg / L. The interaction between metabolic processes involved in the toxicity induced by various PAEs is summarized for the first time in the article. Exposure of PAEs can lead to activation of the detoxification system CYP450 and endocrine system receptors of aquatic animals, which in turn causes oxidative stress, metabolic disorders, endocrine disorders, and immunosuppression. Meanwhile, each system can activate / inhibit each other, causing genotoxicity and cell apoptosis, resulting in the growth and development of organisms being blocked. The mixed PAEs shows no cumulative toxicity changes to aquatic animals. For the combined pollution of other chemicals and PAEs, PAE can act as an agonist or antagonist, leading to combined toxicity in different directions. Phthalate monoesters (MPEs), the metabolites of PAEs, are also toxic to aquatic animals, however, the toxicity is weaker than the corresponding parent compounds. This review summarizes and analyzes the current ecotoxicological effects of PAEs on aquatic animals, and provides guidance for future research. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145418

The tested S. intermedius was divided into two types: large-size (3 cm test diameter) and small-size (1 cm test diameter). Using the existing abalone breeding facilities, we regularly fed Laminaria japonica and Gracilaria lemaneiformis. After six months of breeding, the test diameter of large-size S. intermedius bred in Fuzhou had reached (55.90±2.63) mm, while the body mass had reached (56.30±6.92) g and the gonadal index reached (15.02±1.5)%. The gonadal development entered the stage of premature (Stage III) with good quality, which was significantly greater than the test diameter (46.56±3.88) mm and body mass (39.07±5.05) g for S. intermedius bred in Dalian in the same period (P<0.05). Besides, the test diameter of small-size S. intermedius in Fuzhou had reached (40.97±0.87) mm, while the body mass had reached (23.18±0.37) g and the gonadal index had reached (9.64±1.00)%. Thus, it is suggested that seasonally breeding S. intermedius in the coastal areas of Fujian Province in winter and spring is feasible. Feeding with local fresh algae on basis of existing facilities and abalone cages leads to higer growth rate of S. intermedius than those bred in Dalian in the same period.

In California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico), overfishing and climate change-linked diseases are thought to be responsible for mass mortalities and significant declines in abalone fisheries landings. Conservation aquaculture is an option for enhancing abalone populations through captive propagation and cage mariculture with subsequent restockings into the wild. To test, inform, and promote innovative sustainable seafood production strategies in the Northeastern Pacific, we designed an experimental mariculture system at San Jeronimo Island, Baja California. We explored the feasibility of rearing juvenile red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, in a near-shore mariculture cage-based production system to supply individuals for local restoration programs. We tested the effects of 2 different depths, surface and bottom (5 m), and 3 macroalgal diets (Macrocystis pyrifera, Eisenia arborea, and a mixed diet of Pelagophycus porra with M. pyrifera) on the survival and growth of juvenile red abalone (32 ± 3.33 mm in shell length) inside cages attached to a long-line system. Over the 90-d experiment, survival was 99% for the surface treatment and 95% for the bottom treatment. Mean daily increment in shell length was 93 ± 12 µm·d–1 in surface cages and 82 ± 13 µm·d–1 in bottom cages. Depth did not affect growth or survival. Growth was highest using the E. arborea diet (99 ± 7 µm·d–1) but not significantly different from the M. pyrifera and mixed diets (88 ± 10 and 74 ± 13 µm·d–1, respectively). High survivorship and growth indicate that San Jeronimo Island can support cage-based mariculture of red abalone and that this strategy may be a useful tool in developing climate-resilient abalone restoration solutions aimed at bolstering seafood production. © 2020, Universidad Autonoma de Baja California.

Matsumoto Y.; Yatsuya K.,Fenton reaction as a possible stimulus to induce spawning in Ezo abalone Haliotis discus hannai during stormy weather,2021,Marine Ecology Progress Series,669,,241,246,,"Synchronous spawning is an important behavior which increases fertilization success of invertebrates with external fertilization. Previous work has shown that free radicals can induce spawning behavior in tank experiments, but the stimulus for spawning in the wild is not fully understood. Ezo abalone Haliotis discus hannai mainly spawn during stormy weather. Rainwater contains H2O2 and iron (II) ions (Fe2+). We propose that during stormy weather, water layers in the ocean are mixed and the surface layer containing H2O2 and Fe2+ interacts with the ocean bottom; this leads to conditions suitable for the occurrence of the Fenton reaction (wherein Fe2+ ions are oxidized to iron [III] ions by H2O2, and ·OH and hydroxide ions are generated). Hydroxyl radicals (·OH) are generated during the oxidization of Fe2+ by H2O2, and we hypothesized that these induce spawning behavior of abalone in the wild. We observed that H. discus hannai released eggs after salinity decreased as a result of rainfall during stormy conditions. In addition, a tank experiment demonstrated that ·OH generated by the Fenton reaction induced synchronous spawning behavior between the sexes. This study provides a new hypothesis about control of synchronous spawning in H. discus hannai, and the results might be applicable to other invertebrates. © Inter-Research 2021.",10.3354/meps13742

Here, we characterized HIF-1α in Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), an aquaculture-relevant mollusk species, and its transcriptional regulation patterns in response to oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent stimuli were investigated. The molecular cloning and sequence analysis revealed that the abalone HIF-1α shared conversed features in its domain organization such as basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) domain, Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain, oxygen-dependent degradation domains (ODDDs), and C-terminal transactivation domain (C-TAD) with metazoan orthologs. The abalone HIF-1α was proven to be transcriptionally active in multiple tissues according to dissolved oxygen contents, with the most sensitive responsiveness in the gill. Under non-hypoxic conditions, the tissue-dependent transcriptional regulation patterns of the abalone HIF-1α were closely correlated and intertwined with those of HSP90 and MT in response to thermal challenge and heavy metal exposure, respectively. The abalone HIF-1α expression was significantly modulated under normoxic conditions in response to immune challenges with lipopolysaccharide and Vibrio harveyi with the highest upregulation in the hemocytes. However, the combined treatment of hypoxia and immune stimulation exhibited no synergistic activation for the induction of HIF-1α mRNA. Collectively, dynamic transcriptional regulation of the abalone HIF-1α with the tissue specificity in response to oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent stimulatory challenges suggests that HIF-1α plays crucial roles in interdependent crosstalk between hypoxia, innate immunity, and environmental stresses, which can be a useful basis to investigate cellular and physiological responses of farmed abalones to oxygen depletion and other-related stress factors. © 2020 The Authors",10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.100566

During the day, abalones take shelter under rocks or in crevices from which they emerge to forage in the evening. In this study, we explored the effect of changing seawater temperature on the foraging and hiding behaviors of the juvenile Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai. First, we tested whether their hiding behavior in response to light differs depending on the temperature (11°C, 14°C, and 17°C) when only artificial shelter was provided. We observed that the abalones hid under the shelter much faster at 17°C than at 11°C. Second, we tested whether their hiding and foraging behaviors changed in response to increasing temperature when both food and shelter were provided. At high water temperature (17°C), abalones emerged more quickly than at low water temperature (11°C), and the total number of feeding abalones was higher at high temperature than that at low temperature. However, the hiding speed in response to light in the morning was not significantly different among different temperatures. These results suggest that although the basic response to a single stimulus (i.e., light or food) was faster at higher temperatures than at lower temperatures, abalones may increase their boldness under higher temperatures when deciding whether to feed or hide. © 2020, KSO, KIOST and Springer.",10.1007/s12601-020-0024-8
Gao X.; Pang G.; Luo X.; You W.; Ke C.,Effects of stocking density on the survival and growth of Haliotis discus hannai ♀ × H. fulgens♂ hybrids,2020,Aquaculture,529,,,,735693,"In order to examine the effects of different stocking densities and culture methods on the growth, food intake and expression of related genes in Haliotis discus hannai ♀ × H. fulgens♂ hybrid abalones, juvenile abalones were placed into three treatment groups of different stocking densities (400, 600, 800 ind/m2) and cultured using two different methods, including suspension cages and bottom sowing. There were three replicates of each experimental group (stocking density and culture method) and the experiment lasted for 180 days. The results showed that the survival rate, specific growth rate of shell length and body weight, food intake and feed conversion efficiency of the abalones cultured in suspension cages were significantly lower than those in the bottom sown group. For abalones cultured by bottom sowing, there was no significant difference between the specific growth rate of shell length and body weight, feed conversion efficiency, α-amylase, cellulase activity and the expression levels of Hdlam on each sampling occasion for the 400 and 600 ind/m2 treatments. However, these parameters were significantly higher in both the 400 and 600 ind/m2 treatments compared with the 800 ind/m2 treatment. When the stocking density was increased to 800 ind/m2, the food intake and the expression levels of Hdaly, Hdcel, Hdamyl of the abalones cultured in both culture methods were significantly lower than the 400 and 600 ind/m2 treatments. This indicates that even with sufficient food supply, some abalones were unable to capture food due to the constraints of the culture space and the feeding method used by abalones, resulting in reduced growth. The findings of this research suggest that the growth and food intake of abalones can be promoted and production can be improved at a stocking density of 600 ind/m2. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735693

The aim of the present study was to improve the sperm cryopreservation technique for this valuable species using an antifreeze protein III (AFPIII). Post-thaw sperm quality parameters including mo-tility, acrosome integrity (AI), plasma membrane integrity (PMI), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), DNA integrity, fertility, hatchability, and mRNA abundance level of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) were determined to ensure improvement of the cryopreservation technique. Post-thaw motility of sperm cryopreserved with AFPIII at 10 µg/mL combined with 8% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (61.3 ± 2.7%), 8% ethylene glycol (EG) (54.3 ± 3.3%), 6% propylene glycol (PG) (36.6 ± 2.6%), or 2% glycerol (GLY) (51.7 ± 3.0%) was significantly improved than that of sperm cryopreserved without AFPIII. Post-thaw motility of sperm cryopreserved with 2% MeOH and 1 µg/mL of AFPIII was also improved than that of sperm cryopreserved without AFPIII. A combination of 10 µg/mL AFPIII with 8% DMSO resulted in the highest post-thaw motility, showing AI of 60.1 ± 3.9%, PMI of 67.2 ± 4.0%, and MMP of 59.1 ± 4.3%. DNA integrity of sperm cryopreserved using 10 µg/mL AFPIII combined with 8% DMSO was not significantly (p > 0.05) different from that of fresh sperm. Cryopreservation using a combination of AFPIII with 8% DMSO improved fertilization and hatching rates of sperm compared to that of cryopreservation without supplementation of 10 µg/mL AFPIII. Sperm cryopreserved using AFPIII showed higher mRNA abundance levels of HSP90 than those cryopreserved without AFPIII. Results of the present study suggest that 10 µg/mL AFPIII combined with 8% DMSO can be used for large scale cryopreservation of Pacific abalone sperm and for hatchery production. © 2021 by the authors.

Susanlimocotyle n. gen. is characterized by species possessing: an intestinal ceca confluent posteriorly; a male copulatory organ, comprising a variable tube, articulated with the accessory piece; a sclerotized vagina, vaginal aperture dextro-ventral; an onchium; a robust ventral bar; two dorsal bars; a ventral anchor with elongated shaft and a dorsal anchor with deep root expanding into wings. In addition, new molecular data of Chauhanellus spp. are also provided and used for the evaluation of the phylogenetic relationships among monogenoids parasitizing siluriforms. Susanlimocotyle n. gen. exhibited a higher genetic divergence level for 18S rDNA (4.6 to 7.2% [83–130 bp]) with respect to Chauhanellus spp. despite sharing S. herzbergii as a host, than Hamatopeduncularia spp., (4.1 to 5.8% [75–110 bp]) from Oriental ariids. For the 18S rDNA, 5.8S rDNA, ITS1 and ITS2 regions, C. boegeri and C. susamlimae were observed to have the smallest interspecific distances, and C. velum was revealed to be the most genetically distant species to Chauhanellus. The proposal for Susanlimocotyle n. gen. is also supported by phylogenetic analysis based on the 18S rDNA gene, which supports the close relationship between the new genus and Hamatopeduncularia and Chauhanellus from ariids from the South America and Oriental regions. Moreover, the patterns towards the shared diversification between monogenoids and their ariid hosts were addressed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.parint.2020.102271
Wu Z.; Zhang S.; Yang Z.; Xiong H.; Ma Y.,The influence of feeding CAVP on intestinal microbiota of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus),2019,Journal of Fishery Sciences of China,26,3,546,558,,"The nutrient content of abalone viscera is similar to that of muscle. It contains rich proteins and various biologically active substances. However, the abalone viscera are often abandoned when processing or during consumption of abalone. This is not only a great waste, but also causes pollution to the environment. In recent years, with the exploration and research of marine active substances, abalone viscera have also been studied and developed. Intestinal microorganisms are known as ""external organs"" of the host, they are directly involved in the host's nutrition, immunity, metabolism, and so on. They play important roles in maintaining the health of the host. A few studies have reported the in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activity of abalone polysaccharides and polypeptides; however, the effects of abalone active substances on the intestinal microorganism have not been previously reported. In this paper, the intestinal microbiota of tilapia and the influence of feeding abalone visceral crude polysaccharide (CAVP) on the intestinal microbiota were studied by PCR-DGGE and Illumina MiSeq sequencing. A total of 13 bacterial phyla were detected in the intestines of tilapia: Fusobacteria (77.84%) was the dominant phylum, Bacteroidetes (8.59%), Chlamydiae (6.18%), Proteobacteria (5.84%), and Actinobacteria (1.20%) were the subdominant phyla. Saccharibacteria, Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, TM6_Dependentiae, Cyanobacteria, Spirochaetae, Acidobacteria, and some unknown groups were also detected. At the genus level, Cetobacterium (77.84%) was the dominant genus, Neochlamydia (5.80%), Plesiomonas (2.64%), and Acinetobacter (1.13%) were the subdominant genera. There was also an unknown genus of the family Porphyromonadaceae, accounting for 8.29%. In addition, Mycobacterium, Alsobacter, Aquicella, Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, Alpinimonas, and some unknown genera were also detected. The addition of CAVP diet had an obvious influence on the intestinal microbiota of tilapia because the CAVP-treated samples and the control samples without CAVP clustered separately. After feeding CAVP, the abundance of Actinobacteria, Saccharibacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and TM6_Dependentiae decreased significantly (P<0.05). At the genus level, the abundance of Plesiomonas and Cetobacterium was up-regulated, whereas the Neochlamydia, Acinetobacter, Mycobacterium, Alsobacter, Aquicella, Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, and Alpinimonas decreased, of which the abundance of Mycobacterium, Alsobacter, Aquicella, and Plesiomonas decreased significantly compared with that of the control (P<0.05). After feeding CAVP, the abundance of some pathogens, such as Mycobacterium abscessus, Acinetobabacter baumannii, Aeromonas sharmana, Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, in which the Mycobacterium abscessus and Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens decreased significantly compared with that of the control (P<0.05). On the other hand, the probiotic bacteria, such as Cetobacterium, increased. This study investigated the effects of CAVP on the host with regard to intestinal microbes; it provides insight into the efficient evaluation of marine active substances, and also lays a theoretical foundation for the development and utilization of bioactive substances and the development of prebiotics from abalone viscera. In addition, this study is of importance in recycling abalone viscera and reducing environmental pollution. © 2019 Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences.",10.3724/SP.J.1118.2019.18221

Euryhaliotrema luisae n. sp. ex C. brachysomus is differentiated from other congeneric species by the morphology of the male copulatory organ, which comprises a coil of nine counterclockwise rings, and by the morphology of the anchors and bars. Euryhaliotrema magnopharyngis n. sp. ex C. brachysomus can be distinguished from all other congeners by having a well-developed pharynx occupying much of the anterior region and by the ventral bar, which is V-shaped, with well-elongated, thin arms. In addition, E. luisae n. sp. and E. magnopharyngis n. sp. can be differentiated from all other members of Euryhaliotrema Kritsky & Boeger, 2002 by the presence of a glandular oval plate lying on peduncle. Haliotrema diplotaenia n. sp. ex B. diplotaenia is characterized by the structure of the male copulatory organ, comprising a tapered-shaped cirrus tube with twisted acute tip and a filament-shaped accessory piece with medial and distal expansions, and by the morphology of the ventral bar (inverted W-shaped, with short lateral ends and two anterior conical protuberances). Haliotrema saezae n. sp. ex B. diplotaenia differs from all other members of Haliotrema Johnston & Tiegs, 1922 by having a tubular copulatory organ with curved distal tip and a filament-shaped accessory piece without lateral expansions, and by the morphology of anchors and bars.

The abalone was usually transported to the north(Rongcheng, Shandong) in April from southern China(Lianjiang, Fujian)and returned to the south in November. In this study, the impact of this mode on the nutritive compositions of abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) was investigated.The main method was the series of GB.5009. The determined indexes include moisture, cholesterol, ash, protein, lipid, glycogen, collagen, mineral elements(Mg, Al, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Se),delicious amino acids(aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, arginine, methionine, lysine),taurine and fatty acid. SPSS 24.0 statistical software(independent sample t-test)was used to determine the significance of the differences between two groups. The experimental results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation.Two groups of adult abalone(two years old)with the same algae diet (Gracilaria lemaneiformis) were sampled for the analysis in December, 2017. One group was cultured in Lianjiang, Fujian (Southern China) without migration (LJ-DD) and the other was moved to Shandong (Northern China) before the summer and returned to Lianjiang in November (SD-DD). Live samples were moved to laboratory within 24 hours, taking abalone foot muscle to freeze drying after dissection and grinding into powder. These powder were saved in −80 °C freezer.The results showed that contents of ash and collagen were higher in LJ-DD, but not significant. The cholesterol, lipid and glycogen content were higher in SD-DD, but not significant. Moisture content was significantly higher in SD-DD (76.50%WW) than in LJ-DD(73.70%WW) while total protein content was significantly lower in SD-DD(48.40%DW). For mineral profile, Se content was significantly higher in LJ-DD(0.07 mg/100g)than SD-DD(0.05 mg/100g). Besides, Mg and Al contents were higher in SD-DD and Ca, Fe, Cu and Zn contents were lower in SD-DD, but the differences were not significant. For amino acid profile, the contents of glutamic acid, arginine, lysine and total delicious amino acid were significantly higher in LJ-DD than in SD-DD. Besides, taurine content was significantly lower in SD-DD than in LJ-DD. For fatty acid profile, C20:3n6 content was significantly higher in LJ-DD than in SD-DD. SFA and N-3 fatty acid were higher in SD-DD，and MUFA, PUFA and EPA+DHA contents were higher in LJ-DD，but not significantly. The value of N6/N3 was lower in SD-DD than in LJ-DD, but the differences were not significant. Overall，two groups had similar composition, but SD-DD had higher nutritional values than LJ-DD.To summarize, the south-north relay mode has both some negative influences and some positive influences on the nutritional quality of H. discus hannai, but such difference is not significant as a whole. © 2020 Shanghai Ocean University.

Sandamalika W.M.G.; Priyathilaka T.T.; Lee S.; Yang H.; Lee J.,Immune and xenobiotic responses of glutathione S-Transferase theta (GST-θ) from marine invertebrate disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus): With molecular characterization and functional analysis,2019,Fish and Shellfish Immunology,91,,159,171,,"Representing a multifunctional complex group of proteins, glutathione S- transferases (GSTs) play a major role in the phase II detoxification process in a wide range of organisms. This study focused on the potential detoxification ability of disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) GST theta (AbGST-θ) under different stress conditions with special reference to post immune challenges. Characterization of AbGST-θ revealed with 226 amino acids, 26.6 kDa of predicted molecular mass and 8.9 of theoretical isoelectric point. As illustrated in the multiple sequence alignment, eight glutathione binding sites (G-sites) and ten substrate binding sites (H-sites) were identified in well-distinct N-terminal and C-terminal domains of AbGST-θ, respectively. AbGST-θ exhibited its highest sequence identity with Mizuhopecten yessoensis (59.1%) and the phylogenetic tree clearly positioned AbGST-θ with pre-defined GST-θ molluscan homologues. The AbGST-θ was highly expressed in the digestive tract of un-challenged abalones. Upon administering the challenge experiment, AbGST-θ showed significant modulations in their transcriptional levels depending on the time and the tissue type. The optimum temperature was 37 °C and optimum pH was 7.5 for AbGST-θ. The determined enzyme kinetic parameters of AbGST-θ showed low affinity towards 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and glutathione (GSH) as substrates. Nonetheless, with Cibacron blue IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) was calculated to be 0.08 μM while observing 100% inhibition with 100 μM. Furthermore, AbGST-θ resulted in significant protection ability towards H2O2, CdCl2, and ZnCl2 in the disk diffusion assay. Collectively, this study provides evidences for the detoxification ability and the immunological host defensive capability of AbGST-θ in disk abalone. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.fsi.2019.04.004

Eight-hundred forty juveniles were distributed into 12 containers. Three formulated diets were prepared in triplicate. A 15% Undaria was included in the control diet. The 15% Undaria was substituted with a same amount of WRB and TSS, referred to as the DRG and TSS diets, respectively. Finally, dry Undaria was also prepared to compare effect of the formulated diets on performance of abalone. The experimental diets were fed to abalone once a day at a satiation level with a little leftover. The feeding trial lasted for 16 weeks. Crude protein, crude lipid, and ash content of the experimental diets changed over all period of time. Higher crude protein and lipid and ash contents retained in all formulated diets compared to the Undaria were observed at 24 and 48 h after seawater immersion. Survival of abalone was not affected by the experimental diets. Weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone fed the TSS diet was greater than all other diets. Weight gain and SGR of abalone fed the control diet was not different from those of abalone fed the WRB diet. Proximates of the soft body of abalone was affected by the diets. In conclusion, WRB and TSS are the promising feed ingredients to replace Undaria in abalone feed; especially, TSS is superior to either Undaria or WRB. The formulated diets produced improved growth performance of abalone over the single Undaria. © 2018 The Author(s).",10.1186/s41240-018-0089-9

This macroalga is widely cultivated along the coasts of China from south to north, but its cultivation period is limited by high temperature in summer. In the current study, the effects of heat and phytohormone treatments on Rubisco large subunit (rbcL) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) were investigated by using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot technologies in G. lemaneiformis. The results showed that transcript and protein levels of rbcL in G. lemaneiformis were inhibited by heat stress (33 °C), however, 100 μmol/L salicylic acid (SA100) and 50 μmol/L methyl jasmonate (MJ50) treatments reduced the inhibition of high temperature on the expression of rbcL. In SA100 and MJ50 groups, the transcriptional expression of rbcL increased to 1.31- and 1.32-fold at 3 h, and the protein levels of rbcL were enhanced to 1.36- and 2.10-fold at 24 h compared to the heat-stress group, respectively. Moreover, SA100 and MJ50 effectively alleviated the inhibition effect of heat stress on Rubisco activity, and recovered the Rubisco activation states. However, the addition of 50 μmol/L abscisic acid (ABA50) mainly inhibited rbcL expression and Rubisco activity. Heat stress stimulated the transcript and protein levels of HSP70; hsp70 transcript expression further rose by 0.53–1.00 times at 3 h, and its protein expression enhanced by 0.93–2.45 times at 24 h in the heat-stress group after applying SA100, MJ50 or ABA50.

However, little is known about the involvement of other 5-HT receptor subfamilies in the reproduction process. In the present study, we identified the cDNAs encoding eight subtypes of 5-HT receptors from the ganglia tissues of the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai (Mollusca; Gastropoda; Haliotidae), and examined the gonadal expression of the transcripts of 5-HT receptors. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that the molluskan 5-HT receptors are largely classified into four major clades: 5-HT1/5/7, 5-HT2, 5-HT4, and 5-HT6. Among the H. discus hannai (Hdh) 5-HT1-7 transcripts, Hdh5-HT1B, 4A, 4B, and 6 were the major subtypes detected in the mature ovary. Estradiol-17β injection into the pedal sinus induced the downregulation of 5-HT4B and upregulation of 5-HT6 transcripts in the ovary of mature abalone within 72 h. In HEK293 cells overexpressing Hdh5-HT1B, forskolin-stimulated cAMP response element luciferase (CRE-Luc) reporter activity was inhibited by 5-HT in a dose-dependent manner, whereas serum response element luciferase (SRE-Luc) activity was not affected. In Hdh5-HT4A-expressing HEK293 cells, forskolin-stimulated CRE-Luc and SRE-Luc reporter activities were both marginally increased by treatment with a high dose of 5-HT. Our results provide new insights into the roles of 5-HT through diverse G protein-coupled 5-HT receptors in the reproductive process of mollusks. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.ygcen.2019.03.001

Due to the microstructure and its unique toughening mechanisms, nacre possesses an excellent combination of specific strength, stiffness and toughness. This study deals with the possibility of using nacre fragments obtained from abalone shell for making a bulletproof armor system. A composite plate laminated with abalone shell fragments is made and compression and bend tests are carried out. In addition, a bulletproof test is performed with hybrid armor systems which are composed of an alumina plate, a composite plate, and aramid woven fabric to verify the ballistic performance of nacre. The compressive strength of the composite plate is around 258.3MPa. The bend strength and modulus of the composite plate decrease according to the plate thickness and are about 149.2MPa and 50.3 GPa, respectively, for a 4.85 mm thick plate. The hybrid armor system with a planar density of 45.2 kg/m2, which is composed of an 8 mm thick alumina plate, a 2.4 mm thick composite plate, and 18 layers of aramid woven fabric, satisfy the NIJ Standard 0101.06: 2008 Armor Type IV.

Yao T.; Lu J.; Ye L.; Chen H.; Wang J.,Molecular characterization and expression pattern analysis of a defensin (HdDef1) from small abalone (Haliotis diversicolor); [杂色鲍防御素 HdDef1 的分子特征和表达分析],2019,South China Fisheries Science,15,6,1,8,,"Defensin is one of the most important antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that participate in invertebrate innate immunity against invading pathogens. In the present study, a novel defensin was identified in small abalone (Haliotis diversicolor) that was denoted as HdDef1 by using RNA-seq and RACE techniques. The HdDef1 cDNA contained a 201 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 66 amino acids including a signal peptide of 18 amino acids and a mature peptide of 48 amino acids. The mature peptide of Hd-Def1 shared common features of AMPs, such as lower molecular mass, net positive charge (+1) and high hydrophobic residue ratio (45%). In addition, six cysteines in the mature peptide were arranged in the pattern of C-X16-C-X3-C-X9-C-X4-C-X1-C and stabilized the α-helix/β-sheet motif (CSαβ) with three disulfide bonds (C1-C4, C2-C5 and C3-C6) in the predicted tertiary structure. Moreover, by comparision with the similar three-dimensional structure of Anopheles gambiae defensin and phylogenetic analysis, it is suggested that HdDef1 might be a new member of the arthropod defensin family. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis reveals that HdDef1 transcripts were expressed constitutively in intestine, head, gill, hepatopancreas, mantle and foot, with the highest level in hepatopancreas.

There is little known about the abalone innate immune system against pathogen infection. Clip-domain serine proteases (cSPs) are increasingly recognized to play important roles in host immune defense in invertebrates. In this study, we cloned a cSP (Hdh-cSP) from abalone (Haliotis discus hannai). We found out that Hdh-cSP was widely expressed in multiple tissues of abalone, with highest level in the immune-like organ, hepatopancreas. V. parahemolyticus infection induced significantly elevated expression of Hdh-cSP in addition to better-characterized innate immune component genes including Rel/NF-κB, allograft inflammatory factor (ALInFa), macrophage expressed protein (MEP) and caspase-8. Importantly, the silencing of Hdh-cSP reduced the expression of these genes, suggesting that Hdh-cSP was an upstream regulatory factor in V. parahemolyticus infection. Further analysis showed that apoptosis of hemocytes was inhibited when the transcription of Hdh-cSP was knocked down, suggesting that Hdh-cSP participated in cell apoptosis by regulation of caspase 8 expression in V. parahemolyticus infection. Therefore, our study established an important role of cSP in the innate immunity against V. parahemolyticus infection in abalone. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.fsi.2017.10.062

Three experimental diets were formulated with 0 (Control), 700 (LA-700) and 2100 (LA-2100) mg/kg supplement of LA respectively. Each diet was randomly assigned to three replicates of 50 abalones (initial body weight: 3.17 ± 0.01 g), which were exposed to 0.35 mg/L of waterborne Cd. Results showed that abalones’ Cd bioaccumulation in the serum, mantle, gill, muscle and hepatopancreas were significantly reduced in LA supplement groups. Besides, in hepatopancreas, the activities of antioxidative enzymes and concentration of glutathione (GSH) in LA supplement group were significantly higher than those in control. Meanwhile, in hepatopancreas, LA-2100 group showed a significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and the protein carbonyls in LA supplement groups were significantly lower than those in control. Diets with LA supplementation significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of HdhMTF-1 (H. discus hannai metal-responsive transcription factor-1) and HdhMT (H. discus hannai metallothionein), and elevated metallothionein (MT) concentrations in hepatopancreas. In conclusion, it was suggested that dietary LA could alleviate Cd-induced oxidative damage through enhancing antioxidative enzyme activities and upregulating the HdhMTF-1-mediated HdhMT transcription and synthesis. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/anu.12849

Dietary inclusion effect of the combined macroalgae (MA) (Undaria pinnatifida and Hizikia fusiforme) and a single Saccharina japonica on abalone was also compared. Three thousand six hundred juvenile abalone were purchased from a private hatchery and acclimated to the experimental conditions for 2weeks. Six 5-ton flow-through raceway tanks were used, and abalone were randomly distributed into tanks (n=600 per tank). Three experimental diets were prepared in duplicate. Fish meal, FSM, corn gluten meal, and shrimp meal and wheat flour and dextrin were used as the protein and carbohydrate sources, respectively, in the FSM diet. MA was also included in the FSM diet. FSM and MA in the FSM diet were substituted with SBM at the expense of wheat flour and S. japonica, referred to as the SBM and SJ diets. The experimental diets were pelletized by an extruded pelleter. Water stability of nutrients in the experimental diets was monitored at 12, 24, and 48h after seawater immersion. The experimental diets were fed to abalone once a day to satiation with a little leftover for 120days. The retained crude protein and lipid and ash content of the extruded pellets were changed over all period of time. Weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone fed the SBM diet were greater than those of abalone fed the FSM and SJ diets. Weight gain and SGR of abalone fed the SJ diet were also greater than those of abalone fed the FSM diet. The longest shell length, widest shell width, highest shell height, and greatest soft body weight were obtained in abalone fed the SBM diet, followed by the SJ and FSM diets. Proximates of the soft body of abalone were not different among the experimental diets. In conclusion, SBM was a superior protein source to FSM in extruded pellet for growth performance of abalone. Dietary inclusion of a single S. japonica was superior to the combined inclusion of U. pinnatifida and H. fusiforme in the production of abalone. © 2018 The Author(s).",10.1186/s41240-018-0104-1

In this study, a tenderization process (80 °C for 2 h) was applied to improve the quality properties of baked abalone muscle for the developing of ready-to-eat products. The quality properties of baked abalone (150–210 °C, 10–30 min) with and without pre-tenderization treatment prior to baking were evaluated through sensory evaluation, textural analysis and Hunter Lab colorimeter. In addition, amounts of sugars and α-dicarbonyl compounds in these products were determined via HPLC analyses. The baking condition at 180 °C for 20 min combined with pre-tenderization resulted in an optimal product. The baked abalone with pre-tenderization had better textural properties (hardness, 1031.12 ± 101.67; springiness, 0.96 ± 0.02; chewiness, 817.13 ± 113.43; shear, 2843.92 ± 35.67), sensory scores (30.1 ± 2.9) and color (25.28 ± 1.21) as compared to the baked abalone without pre-tenderization (hardness, 1990.91 ± 252.35; springiness, 0.87 ± 0.01; chewiness, 1164.43 ± 195.64; shear, 3910.79 ± 302.12; sensory score, 17.4 ± 1.0; color, 15.91 ± 0.74). The reducing sugar analysis indicated the presence of ribose and glucose in the baked abalone. In addition, the formation of α-dicarbonyl compounds (degraded from reducing sugars) including glucosone, 3-deoxyglucosone, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and diacetyl were significantly promoted by the tenderization process in the baked abalone muscle. And the tenderization treatment led to an average of 218% increase in α-dicarbonyl compounds in the baked abalone muscle. The promotion of the formation of α-dicarbonyl compounds by the tenderization treatment contributed to the accumulation of pigments in the final baked products and led to desirable color. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s11694-018-9765-9

A method of isotope dilution with high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was used to determine TCS and five paraben analogues, including methyl paraben (MeP), ethyl paraben (EtP), propyl paraben (PrP), butyl paraben (BuP), and benzyl paraben (BeP), in 186 shellfish samples covering eight species. Concentrations of parabens and TCS were 0.13–25.5 ng/g wet weight (ww) and <LOQ–6.51 ng/g ww, respectively, indicating their ubiquitous contamination in Shenzhen coastal waters. MeP was the most predominant paraben, followed by EtP and PrP. These three analogues accounted for more than 95% of the total concentrations of parabens. The “high” estimated daily intakes of parabens and TCS with the 95th percentage concentrations were estimated to be 2.15–26.1 and 0.41–10.3 ng/kg bw/day, respectively, much lower than the acceptable dietary intakes of parabens (1 × 107 ng/kg bw/day) and TCS (200 ng/kg bw/day), indicating no significant human health risks from shellfish consumption in the studied region.

In this study, instead of extracting polysaccharides (PUs) from U. prolifera, algae powder was used directly as the primary carbon source in a fermentation medium. Five percent (5%) algae powder was more conducive to fermentation. Using submerged liquid fermentation, the soluble components of U. prolifera were released efficiently in a 50-L fermenter. Levels of mannitol acquired using submerged liquid fermentation were 1.8 times higher than those acquired using the hot-water method, and polysaccharides were efficiently hydrolyzed to form oligosaccharides with an average molecular weight of approximately 3300 Da. Furthermore, a 2-month experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of U. prolifera fermentation extracts on the growth performance of juvenile abalone (Haliotis discus hannai Ino). Diets containing algae fermentation extracts in concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 1% significantly increased linear shell growth rate (LGR), weight growth rate (WGR), and specific growth rate (SGR). Diets supplemented with fermentation extracts in concentrations of 0.5 and 1% significantly increased the degree of green coloration in the shell. Treatment of algae tissue using submerged liquid fermentation has the advantages of high efficiency and convenient process monitoring. Additionally, the technique can be scaled up for use in animal husbandry and aquaculture. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10811-018-1413-6

Abalones, a type of single-shelled gastropod, are the most important commercial species in shellfish cultivation in Indonesia. To evaluate the potential ecological risks posed by temperature stress, we measured biological responses such as survival rates, mucus production, muscle hardness and histologically foot muscle abnormalities in Haliotis squamata. In addition, biochemical responses and gene expression profile were also evaluated in the exposed experiment to various temperature gradients. Thermal shock was carried out in 4 rectangular glasses aquarium (100 L). Abalones were divided into four groups for temperature treatment, in triplicates. The temperature treatments ware adjusted to 28, 30, 32 and 34°C in advance. Every aquarium contained 3 pcs of 20 cm long 3"" PVC pipe for rearing 30 abalones 32.97±1.83 mm per PVC. Following 4 days of temperature exposure, the dead abalones were collected from each aquarium, after which the number of surviving abalones in each aquarium was recorded. These results represented the survivorship at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Abalone hemolymph were collected randomly by 1 mL 25 gauge microsyring at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 96 hours. The hemolymph samples were stored in -20°C until analyzed. Increase in temperature stress triggers more mucus production and hardness of the muscle and abnormal foot muscle structure. Furthermore, antioxidant enzyme activity increased in abalone exposed to relatively lower and higher temperatures (28, 32 and 32°C). Super oxide dismutase, catalase and phenol oxidase activity were determined in a time-dependent manner after high temperature pressure. Generally, production of heat shock 70 and 90 proteins also increased significantly in H. squamata which were treated in temperatures gradient (more than 30°C) for 6-12 hours.

Rainford’s butterflyfish, Chaetodon rainfordi (McCulloch, 1923), is endemic to the western Pacific. This fish species belongs to one of the main ornamental fish families imported into Brazil. Haliotrema is a genus of the family Dactylogyridae. Species of this genus have very interesting host associations and geographic distributions. The aim of this study was to report on occurrences of exotic Haliotrema aurigae in diseased Rainford butterflyfish that were imported to Brazil. One Rainford’s butterflyfish with suspected parasitic disease was euthanized and subjected to skin and gill scraping. The parasite specimens were mounted on semi-permanent slides with Hoyer’s solution for morphological analysis of sclerotized structures. The hard-sclerotized structures of these specimens were compared and were identified as those of Haliotrema aurigae (Yamaguti, 1968). These results emphasize the importance of implementation of correct control measures at the country’s borders, to avoid the introduction of exotic parasites.

The gut bacterial communities of abalone species characterized so far reveal considerable interspecific variability, likely resulting from bacterial interactions and constrained by the ecology of their abalone host species; however, they remain poorly investigated. Additionally, the extent to which structural changes in the microbiota entail functional shifts in metabolic pathways of bacterial communities remains unexplored. In order to address these questions, we characterized the gut microbiota of the northeast Pacific blue (Haliotis fulgens or HF) and yellow (Haliotis corrugata or HC) abalone by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to shed light on: (i) their gut microbiota structure; (ii) how bacteria may interact among them; and (iii) predicted shifts in bacterial metabolic functions associated with the observed structural changes. Our findings revealed that Mycoplasma dominated the GI microbiome in both species. However, the structure of the bacterial communities differed significantly in spite of considerable intraspecific variation. This resulted from changes in predominant species composition in each GI microbiota, suggesting host-specific adaptation of bacterial lineages to these sympatric abalone. We hypothesize that the presence of exclusive OTUs in each microbiota may relate to host-specific differences in competitive pressure. Significant differences in bacterial diversity were found between species for the explored metabolic pathways despite their functional overlap. A more diverse array of bacteria contributed to each function in HC, whereas a single or much fewer OTUs were generally observed in HF. The structural and functional analyses allowed us to describe a significant taxonomic split and functional overlap between the microbiota of HF and HC abalone.

The present study investigates the effect of elevated temperature on hatching rate, growth and survival of larvae and breeders of tropical mollusk, donkey’s ear abalone (Haliotis asinina). Different life stages of abalone were exposed to the following temperature treatments: ambient (29°C), +2°C (31°C), and +4°C (33°C). Hatching rate was significantly reduced when the fertilized eggs were incubated at temperature 4°C above ambient. Increase in temperature at 2°C above ambient can significantly influence the survival of larvae. Significant decline in the survival was observed when the larvae were exposed at temperatures 31°C and 33°C, however bigger larvae were observed in groups reared at 31°C, while those larvae that were reared in 33°C were significantly smaller. Furthermore, reduced growth, feeding rate and survival were also observed in breeders reared at elevated temperature. The result of the study suggests that early developmental stages and reproducing adult abalone were vulnerable to the impact of climate change. © 2017, BIOFLUX SRL, All rights reserved.",

However, high temperatures have limited its growth and industrialization in the southern coast. The stress-resistant phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) is intimately related to chorismate metabolism. In this study, the transcriptional level of two chorismate metabolic enzymes, isochorismate synthase (ICS) and chorismate mutase (CM) from G. lemaneiformis, were used to analyze the effects of the addition of SA under two temperature conditions. Results showed that high temperature (33°C) and SA stimulated the transcriptional expression of the two enzymes, e.g., compared to the corresponding control, ics expression level ranged from 2.84 to 4.76 times at 23°C and from 1.25 to 1.62 times at 33°C after addition of SA within 3-12h; cm expression level increased to 2.73 times at 23°C and 1.82 times at 33°C at 24h. Then, the encoding genes of the two enzymes were transferred into pET28a vector, respectively, and the recombinant ICS and CM proteins were expressed largely in the inclusion bodies. The optimal induction conditions of the recombinant proteins were at 16°C for 24h by 0.1mmol/L IPTG. Finally, the recombinant proteins were preliminarily purified with a nickel column.

Animals were divided into normal and model control groups, and low-, middle-, and high-dose groups (125, 250, and 500 mg/kg AVP), as well as GSH groups. In addition to the main component of protein, the AVP also contained 5.11% polysaccharide and a small amount of minerals. It was found that the peptide components at molecular weight of 180-500 u were main fractions. The hydrophobic amino acid and branched chain amino acid contents in the complete amino acids of AVP were 49.77% and 22.92%, respectively. The EC50 values of both hydroxyl and DPPH radical scavenging activity of AVP were 1. 54 mg/mL and 1.51 mg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the lipid peroxidation inhibitory effect of AVP was better than that of vitamin C. On the other hand, AVP could improve the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in serum and liver of the aging mice induced by D-galactose, decrease the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in serum, and attenuate the morphological damage in liver tissue.

Methodology: Ten commercial species namely sandfish, blue crab, octopus, tokobushi abalone, skate ray, cod, yellow croaker, filefish, Korean flounder and purplish Washington clam were considered from FSRP to conduct this study. Closed season was incorporated with FSRP in terms of sandfish, blue crab, octopus, skate ray and yellow croaker fishery. Year-round open fishery was applied for other five species (viz., tokobushi abalone, cod, filefish, Korean flounder and purplish Washington clam) in FSRP. Annual fish landing data were collected from 1991 to 2016. Changing patterns in catch history, revenue and social status were evaluated. Results: Due to achieve enough time to breed and feed during seasonal closure, the production was increased dramatically in five marine species, sandfish, blue crab, octopus, skate ray, and yellow croaker. Besides, 86% increased revenue was earned from the integrated policy. Livelihood improved during the last 10 years of FSRP. Interpretation: Mixed catch, economic loss of fishermen and biology of species are the key factors for continuing integrated fisheries management policy successfully. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India)",10.22438/JEB/41/5(SI)/MS_33

Although the majority of fisheries in the world are managed at the national or local scale, most existing approaches to assessing climate impacts on fisheries have been developed on a global scale. It is often difficult to translate from the global to regional and local settings because of limited relevant data. To address the need for fisheries management entities to identify those fisheries with the greatest potential for climate change impacts, we present an approach for estimating expected climate change-driven impacts on the productivity and spatial range of fisheries at the regional scale in a data-poor context. We use a set of representative Mexican fisheries as test cases. To assess the implications of climate impacts, we compare biomass, harvest, and profit outcomes from a bioeconomic model under contrasting management policies and with and without climate change. Overall results show that climate change is estimated to negatively affect nearly every fishery in our study. However, the results indicate that overfishing is a greater threat than climate change for these fisheries, hence fixing current management challenges has a greater upside than the projected future costs of moderate levels of climate change. Additionally, this study provides meaningful first approximations of potential effects of both climate change and management reform in Mexican fisheries. Using the climate impact estimations and model outputs, we identify high priority stocks, fleets, and regions for policy reform in Mexico in the face of climate change. This approach can be applied in other data-poor circumstances to focus future research and policy reform efforts on stocks now subject to additional stress due to climate change. Considering their growing relevance as a critical source of protein and micronutrients to nourish our growing population, it is urgent for regions to develop sound fishery management policies in the short-term as they are the most important intervention to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on marine fisheries. © 2019 Cisneros-Mata et al.

Through hot water extraction, iodine was extracted from the iodine-rich sources and iodized salt was successfully prepared with extracted iodine and sea salt by spray drying; extraction efficiency varied from 64.88% to 129.67%; yield, 38.45% to 57.09%; loading efficiency, 99.34% to 124.08%. Chemical interactions were assessed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and thermal dynamics was evaluated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Morphology of the salt crystals was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, a storage test was performed to investigate iodine loss due to temperature, relative humidity, and oxidation for 10 weeks in harsh condition. On comparing our salt with commercial products, novel iodized salts displayed similar or superior stability. Therefore, the novel iodized salt prepared in this study can be applied in the food industry. Practical Application: Iodine is essential trace element and plays a key role in our body. Marine products such as Laminaria ochroleuca (Kombu), Porphyra umbilicalis (nori), Undaria pinnatifida (wakame), and Haliotis discus hannai (abalone) are known as iodine rich-sources. These products have high level of iodine, but iodine in marine products has not been used widely for food industry. Therefore, using iodine in natural sources, novel iodized salt was prepared with simple method (hot water extraction and spray drying). The novel iodized salt prepared in this study can be applied in the food industry. © 2018 Institute of Food Technologists®",10.1111/1750-3841.14163

Genetic data regarding this species are limited to the 16S rRNA gene. The inability to grow it axenically has hindered its genetic and genomic characterization and, in consequence, a thorough analysis of its systematics. Here, we amplified and sequenced five genes (16S rRNA, 23S rRNA, ftsZ, virD4 and virB11) of Ca.Xc from infected abalone to analyse its phylogenetic position. Phylogenies from concatenated DNA and amino acid sequences with representative genera of most Rickettsiales unequivocally place Ca.Xc in the family Anaplasmataceae. Furthermore, the family has two reciprocally monophyletic lineages: one leading to (Neorickettsia, Ca.Xc) and the other to ((Ehrlichia, Anaplasma), Wolbachia)). A molecular-clock Bayesian reconstruction places Ca.Xc as the most basal lineage in Anaplasmataceae. These phylogenetic hypotheses shed light on patterns of host evolution and of ecological transitions. Specifically, Neorickettsia and Ca.Xc inhabit aquatic hosts whereas the remaining Anaplasmataceae are found in terrestrial hosts. Additionally, our evolutionary timeline places the directly transmitted marine Ca.Xc as the basal Anaplasmataceae, ancestral to both freshwater and terrestrial species with adaptations leading to more complex life cycles involving intermediate vectors or reservoir species; this supports the hypothesis of a marine origin for this bacterial family. © 2017 IUMS.",10.1099/ijsem.0.001563

Feeding behavior was scored in terms of the following activities: quiescence, alertness, moving, feeding, distance traveled, velocity, and homing. There was a significant effect of diet type and temperature on feeding behavior of abalone. Both types of abalone were more active and exhibited the highest velocity when fed the formulated diet at 22°C. Greenlip abalone spent a larger proportion of time feeding on Ulva sp. than on the formulated diet, regardless of the water temperature. In contrast, no significant difference was observed in the proportion of time feeding between diet types for hybrid abalone. Both types of abalone rapidly located and consumed Ulva sp. when feed was introduced into the aquaria at 1600 h (light phase). In contrast, abalone predominantly commenced feeding on the formulated diet in the dark phase, indicating the potential of Ulva sp. as feed attractant in abalone diet, to promote feeding. The mode in which abalone consumed feed also differed between diets. Abalone fed the formulated diet nibbled intermittently on random chips, whereas when fed Ulva sp., abalone engulfed entire individual fronds before moving on to the next available frond. Greenlip and hybrid abalone exhibited homing behavior at the completion of the dark phase, which was more pronounced in abalone fed Ulva sp. This new information may assist in refining feed design and feeding practices for the culture of these two types of abalone.",10.2983/035.035.0310

At larva phase, abalone fed with live feeds microalgae. Some of live feeds for mollusks are Pavlova sp. and Chaetoceros sp.. This research was aimed to know the attachment rate of microalgae Pavlova sp. and Chaetoceros sp. for abalone larva food. The result showed that cell of Pavlova sp. and Chaetoceros sp. had growth at both semi-mass and mass scale. The growth rate of both types of live feeds at semi-mass scale were valued 46 cell mL-1 day-1 for Pavlova sp. and cell mL-1 day-1 for Chaetoceros sp.. The growth rates at mass scale were divided into the rate at column water (25 cell mL1 day-1 for Pavlova sp. and 18 cell mL-1 day-1 for Chaetoceros sp.) and attachment media (42 cell mL-1 day-1 for Pavlova sp. and 27 cell mL-1 day-1 for Chaetoceros sp.). Based on the result, the rate growth for Pavlova sp. at attachment media showed greater value than the rate growth for Chaetoceros sp.. Both types of microalgae could be provided as live feeds for abalone larva by noticing the growth phase at attachment media which started to provide at third day of live feeds culture. © 2017, BIOFLUX SRL.

The aim of this study was to compare IgG4 levels to common food antigens between patients with IBS and healthy controls. Methods Thirty-two patients diagnosed as IBS according to the Rome III criteria (12 diarrhea subgroup; 20 non-diarrhea subgroup) and 32 sex and age-matched healthy controls participated in the study. Serum IgG4 titers to 90 common foods were measured in each subject. The number of subjects with positivity defined as the cut-off value ≥ 0.7 U/mL was compared. Results Patients with IBS had significantly higher IgG4 titers to wheat, leek and taro compared to those of controls. Serum IgG4 titers to ginger, cocoa, walnut, white radish, onion, and lettuce in IBS patients tended to be higher than controls. IgG4 titers to wheat, gluten and gliadin in the diarrhea subgroup, and lettuce, leek and taro in the non-diarrhea subgroup tended to be higher compared with controls. The number of subjects with positivity to apple, orange, lettuce, and leek was significantly higher in IBS patients than controls. The number of subjects with positivity to apple, orange, gluten, and gliadin in the diarrhea subgroup, and egg white, pineapple, soybean, lettuce, and leek in the non-diarrhea subgroup was significantly higher compared with controls. Conclusions Serum IgG4 antibody levels to some common foods are abnormally elevated in IBS patients.

Recent research identified higher optimal dietary CP levels of greater than or equal to 35%for younger than 1-y-old abalone at higher water temperatures (20-22°C). To validate the results of the laboratory-based research, the current trial was designed to investigate the effect of feeding two different commerciallymanufactured diets (standard-protein diet, 32%CP, versus a high-protein diet, 39%CP) to hybrid abalone (Haliotis laevigata ×Haliotis rubra; initial weight: 3.10 g) on growth performance, feed utilization, and sales revenue under on-farm conditions. During this 18-mo trial, abalone were cultured using normal commercial practices over two summer periods at Great Southern Waters abalone farm (Indented Head, VIC, Australia). A significant improvement in specific growth rate (SGR) led to a 9% improvement in biomass gain for abalone fed with the high-protein diet. This improvement was achieved with no differences in survival, and minimal difference in feed input between diets. In addition, the feed conversion ratio of abalone fed with the high-protein feed was 7.1% superior to that of animals fed with the standardprotein diet. On the basis of a farmgate value ofAUD35/kg abalone, for an additional feed input cost ofAUD2/m2 slab tank/y, a 9.5%increase in basic annual sales revenue (AUD44/m2 slab tank/y) was achieved feeding the high-protein diet. In addition, due to an increased SGR by feeding the high-protein diet, the duration of a typical 3-y production cycle for hybrid abalone may be shortened by up to 3.4 mo. By adopting the high-protein diet, farmers may also harvest abalone sooner, and reduce exposure to one less summer. This may reduce heat-related mortalities and further improve productivity, and when combined with savings made with biomass and feed efficiency gains, a more than 10%improvement in productivity across the entire grow-out period for hybrid abalone may be achieved.",10.2983/035.035.0316
Lopata A.L.; Fenemore B.; Potter P.C.,Crustacean allergy in South Africa,2017,Current Allergy and Clinical Immunology,30,4,234,238,,"A TRIBUTE TO PAUL POTTER I have known Prof Paul Potter since 1993, when I joined the National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS) at Groote Schuur Hospital, and I was one of his first doctoral students. Paul was not only my supervisor, but inspired me to investigate new and indigenous allergens causing clinical symptoms in South African allergic subjects. His way of dealing with patients in South Africa, with its unique biodiversity of populations, flora and fauna, was central to my entire career in the field of allergy research. He introduced me to the importance of focusing on patient service and management and not exclusively on the molecular side of laboratory sciences. Under Paul’s guidance, we conducted the first studies in Africa on allergic sensitisation to various indigenous seafood species, for which there were no diagnostics available at the time. We identified a novel allergen in abalone (perlemoen) – the first African allergen given a formal designation by the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS), which was subsequently published in 1997 in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, the premier journal in the field. A new ImmunoCAP for abalone was subsequently developed (f346). Our work on indigenous allergens did not stop with perlemoen. We investigated in detail the allergens causing asthma through inhaling dust when breeding locusts. Not only critters but, in addition, pigeons generate dust that causes allergic alveolitis. All these studies were published in several international journals as well as in the South African Current Allergy and Clinical Immunology Journal, and they provided valuable information for practising clinicians. Through Paul’s dedicated training we were able to establish a strong research team, at the University of Cape Town and then the IDM, supported by seven ALLSA grants and several NRF and MRC grants. This team focused on various aspects of seafood allergy and their research resulted in eight doctoral and master’s students’ successfully completing their degrees in the field of allergy, including murine models on mechanisms of seafood allergy and sensitisation to fish through workplace exposure. Whereas Paul started the African endeavour into seafood allergies with 100 patients from the Western Cape in 1996, 21 years later we continue this legacy of characterising indigenous allergens now Down Under, in Australia. With funding from Australia, the United States and Europe, our team has identified more than 20 novel seafood allergens and is now translating previous and current findings into the development of the first immunotherapeutic for fish and shellfish allergy. I would like to highlight our milestone publication on the immunological cross-reactivity of South African patients with crustacean allergy to a range of related indigenous crustacean species. This study was one of the very first international studies to focus on other crustaceans species besides shrimps or prawns. The diagnostic workup of the subjects in this study was challenging as no specific diagnostics where available at the time. Furthermore, this study also demonstrated distinct different immune responses to specific allergens in individual subjects with crustacean allergy, in particular those to our South African crayfish. © 2017, Allergy Society of South Africa.

Although substances from abalone have bioactivities, such as anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation, anti-metastatic effects of abalone have not been fully revealed. Gastric cancer is a common malignant cancer, but prognosis is poor because of its high metastatic characteristics. In this study, a novel peptide (A2) from abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) was applied to investigate its antimetastatic effects in MKN-28 gastric cancer cells. Enhanced activities of glycogen-synthase kinase 3β(GSK-3β) by A2 treatment contributed to modulation of β-catenin; hence, β-catenin signaling was downregulated, and translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus was repressed. Moreover, cellular protrusions including lamellipodia and filopodia were disrupted through downregulation of Rac1 and Cdc42 in response to A2 in MKN-28 cells. It is suggested that A2 inhibits cell migration through controlling levels of β-catenin, GSK-3β, and also induced disorganization of lamellipodia and filopodia. Therefore, A2 possesses therapeutic properties to treat gastric cancer.",10.2983/035.035.0313
Xu W.; Ni J.,Selection of cutting machine on removing fouling organisms on abalone shellfish and technological parameter optimization,2017,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,33,16,293,298,,"Abalone is a main commercial shellfish in China. Fouling organisms such as Hydroides, Balanus and Ostrea plicatula are harmful for shellfish cultivation. It's common to see lots of fouling organisms adhering on abalone shellfish in Fujian cultivation areas. Fouling organisms will increase the burden and make activities and feeding of abalone hard. The breathing holes are blocked by fouling organisms, which is another danger and may cause abalone suffocation. In this study removal technology was researched to keep the growth of abalone well. We know electric machines such as milling machine, electric motor saw and grinding machine have a certain value in use and the method could be used on removing fouling organisms. In order to verify the optimal machine and improve the removal process, the research focused on the impacts of removal method by machine and its parameters. Survival rate was one of the most important indices for the evaluation of removal processing, and removal speed was the other. The quality of removed shellfish of abalone needed to be judged by sensory evaluation. The comprehensive point was based on shellfish integrity, fouling organisms remained and abalone vitality. Hand held milling machine, electric motor saw and grinding machine were tested separately to remove the fouling organisms. The effects of different machines on removal speed and survival rate were compared, and the effects of different machines on sensory evaluation standard of abalone were analyzed simultaneously to select the optimal machine on removal. Then, the selected machine was tested to make follow-up testing. Different rotary files with the diameter of 6 mm (cylindrical round head, conical round head and conical tip) and different rotating speeds (17 000, 20 000, 23 000, 26 000 and 30 000 r/min) were tested respectively to get the optimal parameters. The results indicated that the optimal machine is hand held milling machine because it could provide stable performance of removal and keep a high survival rate. Although the fouling organisms were removed quickly and thoroughly by grinding machine, the survival rate of abalone was declined significantly after removing. The removal speeds of electric motor saw and hand held milling machine were very close. The score of fouling organisms remained increased significantly because the fouling organisms in the shellfish ditch were removed completely by milling machine with conical round head file. When the milling machine rotating speed was at 20 000-30 000 r/min, the removal speed increased significantly. The temperature of abalone was on the rise when the rotating speed was higher than 23 000 r/min, but the abalone vitality declined quickly with the increasing of the temperature of abalone. Through the test of using the optimal machine to remove fouling organisms, the optimal combination of the parameters above was obtained, which are using hand held milling machine with 6 mm diameter conical round head file, and its rotating speed is 20 000 r/min. Under this condition, the removal speed is 72.69 fouling organisms per minute, the survival rate is 98.87%, and the score of shellfish integrity, fouling organisms remained and abalone vitality is respectively 9.85, 9.72 and 9.81.

This study aimed at reducing salt concentration of fish sauce by electrodialysistechnology and retaining its original flavor and nutritional value to the maximum. In this paper, the desalting rate and the recovery of amino acidsin electro dialysis was established as the index. The effects of voltage, flow rate and salt concentration on electrodialysis desalination process were investigated by the single -factor test. One -Way analysis of variance indicated that the best parameters for desalination of fish sauce were: 20 V of operating voltage, 40 L/h of operating flow, and 5.14% of salt concentration. Then the orthogonal test was used to determine the best process conditions: the operating voltage of 20 V, the operation flow of 35 L/h, and salt concentration of 5.14%. It also turned out that 80.72% of the saltsin the abalone viscera fish sauce could be successfully removed and 91.66% of amino acidswere retained through the optimum operating conditions. © 2016, Editorial Office of Journal of CIFST.

Interestingly, vWF like domains are also commonly found in load bearing systems of marine organisms such as in underwater adhesive of mussel and sea star, and nacre of marine abalone, and play a critical load bearing function. Recently, Proximal Thread Matrix Protein1 (PTMP1) in mussel composed of two vWF type A like domains has characterized and it is known to bind both mussel collagens and mammalian collagens. Results: Here, we cloned and mass produced a recombinant PTMP1 from E. coli system after switching all the minor codons to the major codons of E. coli. Recombinant PTMP1 has an ability to enhance mouse osteoblast cell adhesion, spreading, and cell proliferation. In addition, PTMP1 showed vWF-like properties as promoting collagen expression as well as binding to collagen type I, subsequently enhanced cell viability. Consequently, we found that recombinant PTMP1 acts as a vWF domain by mediating cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and formation of actin cytoskeleton. Conclusions: This study suggests that both mammalian cell adhesion and marine underwater adhesion exploits a strong vWF-collagen interaction for successful wet adhesion. In addition, vWF like domains containing proteins including PTMP1 have a great potential for tissue engineering and the development of biomedical adhesives as a component for extra-cellular matrix. © 2016 Yoo et al.",10.1186/s12896-016-0247-z

Biofilm confers to bacteria more resistance to physical and chemical agents as well as to different mechanisms of the innate immune system. The aim of this work was to evaluate the ability of in vitro biofilm production in 32 S. uberis isolates from bovine mastitis and identified by biochemical tests and subsequently confirmed by the amplification of the pauA gene. The isolates were cultivated in TMP broth and TMP broth with the addition of 0.5% glucose, 1% sucrose, 1% lactose or 0.5% skim milk in microtiter plates stained with crystal violet. We demonstrated that S. uberis isolated from bovine mastitis are able to produce biofilms in TMP broth and, also that biofilm formation by S. uberis can be significantly enhanced by the addition of 0.5% glucose or 1% sucrose to TMP broth. This may suggest that the carbohydrates in milk or within the ruminant gut might affect the growth mode of S. uberis. In addition, our results showed that in vitro biofilm production under different conditions of supplementation displays variation among the isolates and that each isolate shows a particular profile of biofilm production. This phenotypic heterogeneity in biofilm production exhibited by S. uberis could at least partly explain why this bacterium has the ability to adapt to different niches facilitating survival to diverse and stressful conditions. © 2017 Asociación Argentina de Microbiología",10.1016/j.ram.2017.04.007

The results indicated that changes in the volatile flavors of abalone samples generated by different fumeol treatments could be sensitively detected using the electronic nose method. The results of GC-MS demonstrated that there were significant changes in the types and relative contents of volatile flavor compounds in fumeol-treated abalone, and 72 and 98 volatile compounds were detected in the liquid smoked abalone I processed with super fumeol II-2001 and liquid smoked abalone II processed with super fumeol II-2008A, respectively. Additionally, phenolic compounds were characteristic substances related to the smoked flavor, and 19 and 22 volatile phenolic compounds (contents: 47.52% and 55.94%, respectively) were found in liquid smoked abalone samples I and II, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) of GC-MS data suggested that GC-MS could effectively distinguish the abalone samples processed using different fumeols, and GC-MS results of the differences in flavor substances were consistent with those from the electronic nose. © 2016, South China University of Technology.

Cell viability, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in each group were measured. The results showed that the AVPP significantly increased HepG2 cell viability at doses of 1.6 mg/mL, 3.2 mg/mL, and 6.4 mg/mL. Additionally, the AVPP increased T-AOC and SOD activity and markedly reduced the MDA levels in a positive dose-response pattern.

Qian J.; Li Z.; Liu J.; Ai J.,Synergistic effects of salinity and stress duration on alpha-amylase expression in Haliotis diversicolor supertexta,2017,Journal of Fishery Sciences of China,24,1,57,64,,"Haliotis diversicolor supertexta is mainly distributed in coastal waters off southern China and is a warmwater, economically important shellfish. H. diversicolor supertexta is characterized by rapid growth, a short breeding cycle, suitability for high density cultivation, and is nutritious, so there is high demand among consumers. Guangdong is often affected by typhoons, so more rain falls there than in other provinces. Sea salinity drops when rainfall increases, and the osmotic pressure in aquatic animals varies because of salinity changes, which can result in massive mortalities of abalone. H. diversicolor supertexta is a local species in Guangdong, making it particularly susceptible. Response surface methodology (RSM) is a collection of statistical and mathematical techniques to optimize a process. This methodology generates an empirical mathematical model that defines the effect of an independent variable on a response of interest to optimize the response. RSM has been applied in ecotoxicological studies of marine bivalve larvae and to investigate the effects of environmental variables on embryonic and larval development. RSM has not been used in any gastropod nutritional studies. In this study, the synergistic effects of salinity and stress duration on alpha-amylase gene expression were assessed using central composite design and RSM. The results show that the linear effects of salinity on alpha-amylase gene expression were not significant (P > 0.05), but the linear effect of stress duration was significant (P < 0.05), suggesting that expression of the amylase gene was affected by stress duration. In addition, the quadratic effects of salinity on amylase gene expression were significant (P < 0.05), but the quadratic effects of stress duration on amylase gene expression were not significant (P > 0.05). No synergism was detected between salinity and stress duration. The RSM model equation for the relationship between amylase gene expression and the two factors was established (R2=80.05%). The Adj. R2 value was 65.80%, and the Pre. R2 values was 50.18%, suggesting a good model fit for prediction. Maximal amylase gene expression was observed when salinity was 31, and stress duration was 36 h. H. diversicolor supertexta is affected by many factors, as it is cultured in a marine environment. Additional factors should be studied in the future.",10.3724/SP.J.1118.2017.16146

During the 6 weeks that the experiment lasted, initial shell length and weight increased from 13.95 ± 0.32 mm to 15.30 ± 0.30 mm and from 0.39 ± 0.02 g to 0.47 ± 0.03 g. Ulva lactuca diet resulted in higher shell growth rate (58.47 ± 16.76 μm day−1), SGR (1.15 ± 0.47%.day−1), weight gain (65.5% ± 33.3), and PER (1.56 ± 0.31), possibly thanks to its higher crude protein content. Both green algae (U. lactuca, U. intestinalis) prove to support the growth of H. tuberculata coccinea.

The goal of our study is to determine if XFZYD, TMGTY or WDD treatment ameliorated myocardial fibrosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and to identify the mechanisms underlying any beneficial effects observed during the courses of the investigation. Methods: Forty-five 12-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats and five age-matched male Wistar-Kyoto control rats were studied for 16 weeks. Each day 6 g·kg-1 or 12 g·kg-1 of XFZYD, TMGTY or WDD was orally administered at the indicated dose, and the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of all rats was measured using the tail-cuff method. Collagen levels were measured via hydroxyproline content assays and histological examination. Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) protein levels were determined via immunhistochemical and Western blot analysis. TGF-β1 mRNA levels were assessed using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: Systolic blood pressure was unaffected, but collagen and TGF-β1 levels in SHRs treated with captopril and XFZYD (12 g·kg-1) were significantly reduced when compared with untreated control SHRs. Administration of 12 g·kg-1 XFZYD increased myocardial cell protection and decreased TGF-β1 mRNA and protein expression when compared with the other SHR treatment groups. Conclusions: XFZYD treatment demonstrated a superior ability to reverse myocardial fibrosis when compared with WDD or TMGTY treatment in SHRs. XFZYD also decreased TGF-β1 mRNA and protein expression, suggesting that the TGF-β1 signaling pathway plays a role in the therapeutic effects of XFZYD treatment. © 2016 Zhang et al.",10.1186/s12906-016-1030-3
Lee S.Y.; Nam Y.K.,"Molecular cloning of metal-responsive transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) and transcriptional responses to metal and heat stresses in Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai",2017,Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences,20,1,,,9,"Background: Metal-responsive transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) is a key transcriptional regulator playing crucial roles in metal homeostasis and cellular adaptation to diverse oxidative stresses. In order to understand cellular pathways associated with metal regulation and stress responses in Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), this study was aimed to isolate the genetic determinant of abalone MTF-1 and to examine its expression characteristics under basal and experimentally stimulated conditions. Results: The abalone MTF-1 shared conserved features in zinc-finger DNA binding domain with its orthologs; however, it represented a non-conservative shape in presumed transactivation domain region with the lack of typical motifs for nuclear export signal (NES) and Cys-cluster. Abalone MTF-1 promoter exhibited various transcription factor binding motifs that would be potentially related with metal regulation, stress responses, and development. The highest messenger RNA (mRNA) expression level of MTF-1 was observed in the testes, and MTF-1 transcripts were detected during the entire period of embryonic and early ontogenic developments. Abalone MTF-1 was found to be Cd inducible and highly modulated by heat shock treatment. Conclusion: Abalone MTF-1 possesses a non-consensus structure of activation domains and represents distinct features for its activation mechanism in response to metal overload and heat stress. The activation mechanism of abalone MTF-1 might include both indirect zinc sensing and direct de novo synthesis of transcripts. Taken together, results from this study could be a useful basis for future researches on stress physiology of this abalone species, particularly with regard to heavy metal detoxification and thermal adaptation. © 2017 The Author(s).",10.1186/s41240-017-0055-y

In this study, we identified a lipopolysaccharide- and β-1,3-glucan-binding protein (LGBP) gene from the pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai (HDH), which is involved in the pattern recognition mechanism and plays avital role in the defense mechanism of invertebrates immune system. The HDH-LGBP cDNA consisted of a 1263-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 420 amino acids, with a 20-amino-acid signal sequence. The molecular mass of the protein portion was 45.5 kDa, and the predicted isoelectric point of the mature protein was 4.93. Characteristic potential polysaccharide binding motif, glucanase motif, and β-glucan recognition motif were identified in the LGBP of HDH. We used its polysaccharide-binding motif sequence to design two novel antimicrobial peptide analogs (HDH-LGBP-A1 and HDH-LGBP-A2). By substituting a positively charged amino acid and amidation at the C-terminus, the pI and net charge of the HDH-LGBP increased, and the proteins formed an α-helical structure. The HDH-LGBP analogs exhibited antibacterial and antifungal activity, with minimal effective concentrations ranging from 0.008 to 2.2 μg/mL. Additionally, both were toxic against human cervix (HeLa), lung (A549), and colon (HCT 116) carcinoma cell lines but not much on human umbilical vein cell (HUVEC). Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis showed that HDH-LGBP analogs disturb the cancer cell membrane and cause apoptotic cell death. These results suggest the use of HDH-LGBP analogs as multifunctional drugs. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",10.3390/md14120227
Sullivan M.A.; Prorok B.C.,Controlling Abalone Shell Architecture with Temperature,2015,Conference Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Mechanics Series,63,VOLUME 2,27,31,,"Biomimetics is a growing field, and abalone shells have become a recently studied topic because of their amazing strength properties. Their shell is composed of calcium carbonate, and it is formed by the mollusk in a unique structure of interlocking tablets called nacre, also known as mother of pearl. There has been much interest in the interactions between tablets, but there are also structural growth lines that occur between layers of nacre that have been unnoticed by other researchers. With these additional non-nacre layers, the material's strength is increased. We show how abalones can be cultured with changes in temperature to adjust shell and nacre growth. Then, they are tested using nanoindentation for qualitative mechanical data. In all, we aim to utilize the abalone nacre architecture based on these composite layers for improved strength applications such as protective armor. © The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2015.",10.1007/978-3-319-06974-6_4

Temperate abalone farmers face issues with tank restocking with highly marketable abalone owing to inefficient spawning induction methods. The identification of key proteins in sexually mature abalone will serve as the foundation for a greater understanding of reproductive biology. Addressing this knowledge gap is the first step towards improving abalone aquaculture methods. Proteomic profiling of female and male gonads of greenlip abalone, Haliotis laevigata, was undertaken using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Owing to the incomplete nature of abalone protein databases, in addition to searching against two publicly available databases, a custom database comprising genomic data was used. Overall, 162 and 110 proteins were identified in females and males respectively with 40 proteins common to both sexes. For proteins involved in sexual maturation, sperm and egg structure, motility, acrosomal reaction and fertilization, 23 were identified only in females, 18 only in males and 6 were common. Gene ontology analysis revealed clear differences between the female and male protein profiles reflecting a higher rate of protein synthesis in the ovary and higher metabolic activity in the testis. Biological significance: A comprehensive mass spectrometry-based analysis was performed to profile the abalone gonad proteome providing the foundation for future studies of reproduction in abalone. Key proteins involved in both reproduction and energy balance were identified. Genomic resources were utilised to build a database of molluscan proteins yielding >. 60% more protein identifications than in a standard workflow employing public protein databases. © 2014.",10.1016/j.jprot.2014.06.001

LPS (5mg/kg body weight) produced hepatic damage that was manifested by significant increases in the activities of marker enzymes (aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase) and reduced antioxidant (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, malondialdehyde) activities. These antioxidant activities were elevated by HDE administration to LPS-treated rats. These results suggested that HDE extracts had a potential hepatoprotective effect in LPS-induced liver damage without any acute toxicity. In addition, reducing power of the extracts and their ability to scavenge free radicals were evaluated by applying DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS [2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt]. This study demonstrates that these extracts have potential hepatoprotective activity which is mainly attributed to the antioxidant potential. Practical Applications: Pacific abalone is an important marine food resource in many Asian countries. A number of experimental studies have demonstrated numerous health benefits of Pacific abalone. In South Korea, abalone has important economic significance as a food and as a functional food. In addition, numerous recent research studies have focused on the nutritional and pharmaceutical values of abalone. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1111/jfbc.12131

In this research we develop and analyse a matrix population model for the New Zealand blackfoot pāua (abalone) Haliotis iris. Preliminary calculations for one population of H. iris yielded a population growth rate (PGR) of 16%. However due to uncertain parameter values we trialled larval settlement rates that resulted in population growth rates (PGRs) from 0 to 17%. The results showed that specific knowledge about settlement rate and juvenile survival was unimportant for the relative influence of these life-history parameters on this deterministic matrix model. Survival of the larger adults consistently had the highest sensitivity and elasticity, however in a rapidly growing population survival of the smaller animals gained importance. Also, the somewhat arbitrary placement of the shell length division between the two classes of adults created changes, with larger classes having higher elasticities. In addition elasticity, (indicating effect on the population growth rate) was concentrated in the older adults. However sensitivity, (with its greater emphasis on evolutionary change) placed more emphasis on slightly younger adults. These findings suggest that survival of larger adult paua, which is the stage typically targeted for harvest, is a key factor in fishery productivity, restoration, and conservation of the species. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.fishres.2013.11.008

Six purified diets were formulated to contain tripalmitin (TP), olive oil (OO, 72.87% 18:1n-9), grape seed oil (GO, 68.67% 18:2n-6), linseed oil (LO, 70.48% 18:3n-3), ARA oil (AO, 41.81% ARA) or EPA oil (EO, 44.09% EPA and 23.67% DAH). No significant difference in survival rate was observed among abalone fed with different diets. Weight gain rate (WGR) and daily growth rate of shell length (DGRSL) were significantly increased in abalone fed with diets containing OO, AO and EO, but decreased in abalone fed with LO diet (P < 0.05) in comparison with those fed with TP. High level of dietary 18:2n-6 resulted in higher content of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in abalone fed with GO than those fed with TP, OO, LO and EO (P < 0.05). n-3 PUFAs in abalone fed with LO was significantly higher than those in abalone fed with TP, OO, GO and AO (P < 0.05). The highest contents of 20:1n-9 and 22:1n-9 were observed in abalone fed with OO.

Both extracts were administered at 50mg/kg and evaluated for their anti-inflammatory effects. Histological evaluations indicated that HDE1 effectively suppressed colonic tissue damage in mice with DSS-induced colitis. In addition, the expression levels of immune-related cytokines and transcription factors such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ), phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (pSTAT1), interleukin-4 (IL-4), phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (pSTAT6) and Gata3 were also downregulated by both extracts. These results indicated that both HDE1 and HDE2 suppressed inflammatory cytokines and mediators. However, histological examinations clearly suggested that HDE1 had greater efficacy in attenuating colonic tissue damage by DSS than HDE2. Therefore, HDE1 may be a potential anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Practical Applications: Pacific abalone is an important marine food source in many Asian countries. The health benefits of Pacific abalone have been demonstrated in a number of studies. This study investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of Pacific abalone extracts in a mouse model of ulcerative colitis. An ethanol extract (HDE1) of Pacific abalone potently suppressed the mucosal tissue damage and crypt loss in the colons of mice exposed to DSS. In addition, inflammatory cytokines and mediators were effectively suppressed by HDE1.

Thus, parentage analysis is a useful tool to establish pedigree reports in molecular-assisted selection programs. Here, we evaluated 10 heterologous microsatellite markers for parentage assignment in abalone hybrids produced from 43 abalone broodstocks of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and Japanese abalone (H. discus hannai). The allele frequencies, exclusion probabilities and broodstock contributions were calculated using CERVUS, PAPA and GERUD software. The polymorphic information content (PIC) values showed that most of the microsatellite loci were highly informative (>0.7) and more than 90% of parentage assignment was possible with a minimum of 5-6 microsatellite markers. Parentage assignment for hybrid and pure-red progeny showed a better performance than pure-Japanese progeny. This result could be due to the high level of allele loss in the parental genotypes. In addition, results indicated that only two sires contributed over 80% and 90% of red and hybrid progenies, respectively.

E. arborea is the kelp with the largest and most southerly latitudinal distribution on the North Pacific East Coast capable of growing at higher temperatures and in relatively low nutrient conditions. The availability of M. pyrifera is frequently uncertain because it is strongly affected by El Niño events. In order to test E. arborea as a diet for farmed abalone, animals of two different sizes (6 and 2 cm) were fed separately for 12 months with these two seaweed species. The abalones were cultured in cages in an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture farm within San Quintín Bay, Baja California, Mexico.

Small size abalone doubled their size on both diets, with an average increase in length of 2.2 mm month−1. No significant differences were observed between both treatments. Large abalone fed with M. pyrifera had slighter higher growth rates compared to those fed with E. arborea (0.57 and 0.50 % day−1, respectively). Although M. pyrifera appeared to be a better diet for large animals, the growth rates obtained with E. arborea and the fact that this species could be cultivated in warmer conditions makes this seaweed species a good candidate to feed farmed abalone. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",10.1007/s10811-013-0138-9
Zhang G.; Li S.; Zhang Q.; Li X.; Mu C.,Optimization of microwave-vacuum drying for detoxified starfish,2015,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,31,16,289,295,,"Starfish is widely distributed in inshore aquaculture zones in China and it is the predator for many aquaculture animals such as oyster, scallop and abalone. Since starfish has strong fecundity and regenerative capacity, the number of starfish has been growing in recent years with the development of inshore aquaculture. The annual yield of starfish has reached 50000 tons in Dalian, which seriously imperils the development of aquaculture industry. Starfish is rich in nutrients such as protein and polysaccharide, but it contains some toxic substances (such as saponin) as well. It is accordingly a potential resource for feed processing industries after being detoxified. The drying of detoxified starfish has been paid more attention because the traditional drying methods are inefficient and hardly for product quality controlling. In this paper, microwave-vacuum drying of detoxified starfish was carried out and the drying rate, product quality and energy consumption were evaluated. The influences of microwave power density (3-7 W/g), pulse time (20-60 s) and relative vacuum degree (between -0.070 and -0.090 MPa) on the drying characteristics, energy consumption and protein retention rate were firstly studied by single-variable experiments. Results showed that when the microwave power density increased from 4 to 7 W/g, the drying time reduced from 18 to 11 min, the average drying rate increased from 2.95%/min to 4.87%/min, and the energy consumption decreased from 0.0130 to 0.0054 kW·h/g, but the protein retention rate dropped to 83.06% from 92.77%; meanwhile, when drying under the pulse time of 60 s, the average drying rate, energy consumption and protein retention rate would be respectively 1.17 times, 75.16% and 97.47% of that when drying under 20 s pulse time. Similarly, drying under -0.090 MPa relative vacuum degree, the average drying rate, energy consumption and protein retention rate were 1.19 times, 68.41% and 1.09 times of that drying under -0.070 MPa, respectively. It would be more favorite by controlling the microwave power density, pulse time and relative vacuum degree respectively within 4-7 W/g, 30-60 s and -0.080--0.090 MPa. In addition, the response surface methodology (RSM) was employed for the multi-variable experiments, and the regression model was accordingly established. Results of RSM experiments demonstrated that the drying process of detoxified starfish was significantly influenced by microwave power density, followed by pulse time and relative vacuum degree. The microwave power density and the pulse time had significant effect on the comprehensive score (P<0.01). An interaction worked between the microwave power density and the pulse time on comprehensive score (P<0.05). The average drying rate of starfish, energy consumption, protein retention rate and comprehensive score would be 2.95%/min, 0.0118 kW·h/g, 93.80% and 0.751, respectively, under the drying conditions of 4 W/g microwave power density, 60 s pulse time and -0.090 MPa relative vacuum degree. Under this condition, the energy consumption of 1 kg detoxified starfish dried with microwave vacuum drying method could be saved by 8 kW·h compared to hot air drying and the drying cost of starfish could reduce by 4 RMB. Meanwhile, a higher protein retention rate and good quality of the dried detoxified starfish could be obtained by microwave vacuum drying. Microwave-vacuum drying is an effective method for detoxified starfish processing and it is a promising approach for the industrial utilization of starfish. ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Survival, shell length, and shell width of juvenile abalone were not affected by dietary DDG levels (P > 0.05). Weight gains of juvenile abalone fed DDG15 and DDG30 diets were not different compared to DDG0, but abalone fed DDG45 and DDG60 diets gained less weight than those fed DDG0 (P < 0.05). Soft body weight/body weight ratio of juvenile abalone fed the DDG60 diet was lower than that of those fed the DDG0 diet (P < 0.05), but proximate composition of the soft body was not affected by dietary DDG levels (P > 0.05). The results of this experiment suggest that DDG is a good replacement for wheat flour and soybean meal, and can be used up to 30% in the diet to maintain the growth performance of the juvenile abalone. © 2014 The Korean Society of Fisheries and Aquatic Science.",10.5657/FAS.2014.0249

Feeding rate (FR) and feed conversion rate were observed by measuring the amount of feed ingested at an interval of 2-3 days. Reduction of growth rate with the increment of density was found in all three species [Specific growth rate in weight (G W) HDD, LD: 0.121, MD: 0.093, HD: 0.069; HM: 0.12, 0.082, 0.061; HG: 0.254, 0.222, and 0.131] and the hybrids HDD × HM (0.18, 0.109, 0.108). The medium density produced the highest growth rates in HM × HG and HG × HM hybrids (0.284, 0.342, 0.28). A growth spurt was observed in all three species and hybrids in the last 44 days of rearing. FR varied from 0.72 to 7.97 % body weight and decreased with the increase in density in all species and hybrids. The results indicate differences in density thresholds for the three abalone species and their hybrids suggesting requirement of different aquaculture management strategies for them. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",10.1007/s10499-012-9606-5

Understanding the nocturnal feeding patterns of abalone is fundamental to feed management and productive abalone farming. In this study, the apparent feed consumption for greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) and hybrid abalone (H. laevigata3Haliotis rubra) fed fresh Ulva sp. or a commercial formulated diet at 18°C or 22°C were investigated at night. Abalone were exposed to low light intensity (3.4 Lux) from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM and darkness from 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM. Abalone were fed to excess daily at 4:00 PM and feed intake was determined at 7:00 PM, 10:00 PM, 1:00 AM, 4:00 AM, and 8:00 AM. When Ulva sp. was added to the tank, greenlip and hybrid abalone immediately displayed a feeding response, which was not observed in abalone fed the formulated diet. Abalone consumed Ulva sp. at a linear rate from 4:00 PM to 8:00 AM. In contrast, the apparent feed consumption rate of abalone fed the formulated diet was minimal from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM, and was highest between 7:00 PM and 1:00 AM. Apparent feed consumption rate of abalone significantly increased as water temperature increased from 18°C to 22°C, but the effect was greater for hybrid abalone compared with greenlip abalone. The total apparent feed intake of both greenlip and hybrid abalone fed Ulva sp. was significantly greater than for both types of abalone fed the formulated diet. The total apparent feed intake on dry basis, and nutrient intake for abalone fed Ulva sp. was significantly lower than for abalone fed the formulated diet. This study indicates that the upper temperature range for feed intake in hybrid abalone is higher than in greenlip abalone. Ulva sp. can stimulate abalone feeding, though the high moisture content in algae can reduce nutrient intake.",10.2983/035.034.0318
Ye Y.-J.; Chen J.; Weng W.-Y.,In vitro antioxidant activity of abalone viscera hydrolysates isolated by ultrafiltration,2015,Modern Food Science and Technology,31,5,130,136and284,,"Abalone viscera hydrolysates were separated by ultrafiltration, and the chemical composition and antioxidant activity of the hydrolysates in different ranges of molecular-weight were investigated. Four fractions (FA, FB, FC, and FD) were obtained by membrane ultrafiltration with molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of 10000, 3000, and 500 u. In fraction FA, total sugar and protein contents were 34.06% and 17.20%, respectively. However, fractions FB, FC, and FD were mainly composed of proteins, and the free amino acid content was 23.20, 25.47, and 28.68 g/10 g, respectively. Based on the results from tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and β-elimination, the high molecular-weight fraction (HMWF) of FA in the spacer gel contained glycoproteins with N-glycosidic linkage, and components with molecular weight of 25 ku were proteins. Gel permeation chromatography data indicated that molecular weight of the fractions FB, FC, and FD were each approximately 300 u. Additionally, the result of in vitro antioxidant assay indicated that fraction FA had a relatively strong 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging ability and reducing power at low concentration. When the concentration was increased above 5 mg/mL, there were no significant differences in the DPPH radical-scavenging abilities among these fractions, but the reducing power of fraction FA was lower than that of other fractions. In both, low and high concentrations, the hydroxyl radical-scavenging abilities of fractions FB, FC, and FD were stronger than that of FA. ©, 2015, South China University of Technology.

Small abalone (40.38±0.31 mm shell length and 14.69±0.39 g body weight for Trial 1 and 37.66±0.33 mm SL and 13.37±0.35 g BW for Trial 2) found in the area were collected by fishers and stocked in cages (50 cm X 50 cm X 20 cm). Two trials with two treatments were conducted with five replicates per treatment. Stocking density was 15 abalone per cage. Results of Trial 1 showed that those fed with a single species diet grew from 40.30±0.45 mm to 44.67±0.38 mm in shell length and 14.71±0.57 g to19.73±0.44 g in weight whereas those fed with mixed algal diet grew from 40.45±0.47 mm to 46.74±0.79 mm in length and 14.67±0.61 g to 23.20±1.08g in total weight after 135 d in culture. There was a significant difference in length and weight after 135 d using the t-test (P<0.05). Results for trial 2 were similar in that a significant difference was observed between the two treatments after 120 d using the t-test (P<0.05). In trial 2, abalone fed with a single-species diet grew from 37.48±0.56 mm to 43.72±0.35 mm in shell length and from 13.47±0.66 g to 19.00±0.59 g in weight whereas those fed with mixed-algae grew from 37.84±0.40 mm to 44.85±0.20 mm in shell length and from 13.27±0.32 g to 20.73±0.36 g in weight. In both cases, mixed-species of red algae produced better growth in shell length and weight. This may be because abalone in the wild rarely feed on single species and they frequently encounter a variety of drift algae. It may also be due to the fact that nutrients lacking in single-species diets may be provided and/or fortified using a variety of seaweeds, which are locally abundant. Survival rate was 100% in all cages. © 2015, Science and Technology Information Institute. All rights reserved.",

Ninety-seven cell populations derived from 30 individuals were cultured in different media with varying compositions of medium supplements, and initial attachment, subculture, and survival for ≥10 weeks were assessed according to medium composition and individual. We also examined the time required for subculture and the rate of cell death according to both culturing period and passage number within 10 weeks. A lack of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and hemolymph significantly inhibited the growth of cultured cells, while we detected no significant effect of medium composition on initial cell attachment. Through data reallocation, with the omission of data from cell populations cultured in FBS-free and hemolymph-free media, we showed that growth inhibition was also affected by individual differences among the abalones used. During the culture, we observed four different types of cell morphology. Moreover, considerable time was required for subculture—18.4 and 19.5 days for first and second subcultures, respectively—and cell death did not occur within 30 days or for passage 0. Our results will provide valuable information for developing universal cell culturing guidelines in abalone species and suggest the feasibility of culturing abalone ovary-dissociated cells. © 2015 The Korean Society of Fisheries and Aquatic Science.",10.5657/FAS.2015.0081

Seven experimental diets were formulated to contain increasing amounts (0%, 0.875%, 1.75% and 3.5%) of GO or LO as dietary lipids. Tripalmitin (TP), rich in 16:0, was supplemented to reach 3.5% (dry weight) total lipid. These diets were named as 0%GO/LO (TP), 25%GO, 50%GO, 100%GO, 25%LO, 50%LO and 100%LO. With the increase of dietary GO or LO inclusion, growth parameters (such as specific growth rate of weight) first increased and then decreased (R2>0.72, P=0.000). The survival rate of abalone was not significantly correlated with dietary GO (R2=0.04, P=0.815) or LO inclusion (R2=0.50, P=0.046). The contents of muscle n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including LA, 20:2n-6, 20:4n-6, 22:2n-6, were significantly positive correlated with dietary GO inclusion (R2>0.895, P=0.000). A positive relationship was significantly noted between the values of muscle n-3 PUFA (ALA, 20:3n-3, 20:5n-3 and 22:5n-3) and the dietary LO inclusion (R2>0.905, P=0.000). DHA was significantly increased and then decreased with dietary LO increase (R2=0.937, P=0.000). The expression levels of putative δ5 Fads in 50%GO group were significantly higher than those of other GO groups (P<0.05). With the increase of dietary LO, expressions of putative δ5 Fads first increased and thereafter reached a plateau (R2>0.929, P=0.000). These results indicated that biosynthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid in muscle of abalone could be increased in response to increasing levels of dietary LA or ALA through increased expressions of putative δ5 Fads. High intakes of dietary LA and/or ALA inhibited the biosynthesis of DHA and compromised the growth performance of abalone. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.05.013
Hai N.V.,The use of probiotics in aquaculture,2015,Journal of Applied Microbiology,119,4,917,935,,"This study aims to present comprehensive notes for the use of probiotics in aquaculture. Probiotics have been proven to be positive promoters of aquatic animal growth, survival and health. In aquaculture, intestines, gills, the skin mucus of aquatic animals, and habitats or even culture collections and commercial products, can be sources for acquiring appropriate probiotics, which have been identified as bacteria (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) and nonbacteria (bacteriophages, microalgae and yeasts). While a bacterium is a pathogen to one aquatic animal, it can bring benefits to another fish species; a screening process plays a significant role in making a probiotic species specific. The administration of probiotics varies from oral/water routine to feed additives, of which the latter is commonly used in aquaculture. Probiotic applications can be either mono or multiple strains, or even in combination with prebiotic, immunostimulants such as synbiotics and synbiotism, and in live or dead forms. Encapsulating probiotics with live feed is a suitable approach to convey probiotics to aquatic animals. Dosage and duration of time are significant factors in providing desired results. Several modes of actions of probiotics are presented, while some others are not fully understood. Suggestions for further studies on the effects of probiotics in aquaculture are proposed. © 2015 The Society for Applied Microbiology.",10.1111/jam.12886

Three diets were formulated to contain 0% (DDG0), 30% DDG (DDG1) replacing wheat flour and 30% DDG (DDG2) replacing fish meal and wheat flour. A commercial feed (CF) was also compared with experimental diets. Three replicate groups of abalone averaging 0.6 ± 0.01 g were fed one of the four diets for 14 weeks. The highest survival rate was observed in the abalone fed the DDG2 diet, which was higher than that of abalone fed the DDG0 diet.

Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. Springer-Verlag, New York, 2005, pp. 200-210), most closely related to Caedibacter taeniospiralis and Fangia hongkongensis, within the Gammaproteobacteria, comprises the single type genus Francisella Olsufjev (J Hyg Epidemiol Microbiol Immunol, 14:67-74, 1970). The genus consists of small (0.7-1.7 μm), nonmotile, Gram-negative (staining faintly), aerobic coccobacilli, which may or may not require additional cysteine (or cystine) for culture, weakly catalase positive, and most (but not all) produce H2S when cultured in cysteine-containing media. Members of the Francisella grow with entire, slightly convex pale white or gray, semitranslucent, mucoid colonies. Incubation time and temperature is dependent on species and strain, but they are relatively slowly growing. Many are capable of facultative intracellular growth. The Francisella have a trans-global distribution, although most isolates have been recovered in the Northern Hemisphere. The type species is F. tularensis, which is further divided into four subspecies, i.e., tularensis, holarctica, mediasiatica, and novicida. Subspecies tularensis and holarctica commonly called biotypes A and B, respectively, can in turn be further divided into several subpopulations based on genetic analysis. F. tularensis causes the disease tularemia in mammalian species and represents a potential category A bioterror weapon. Several members of the genus, e.g., F. noatunensis (subspecies noatunensis and orientalis) and F. halioticida, are highly virulent pathogens of fish and molluscs. These species can be readily distinguished from the remainder of the genus by their lower optimal and cardinal growth temperatures. Despite the relatively small number of described species, an increasing body of evidence exists for the existence of a large and diverse environmental population of as-yet undescribed Francisella species. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of one formula, named Jueyin granules (JYG) in the mouse model of the vaginal epithelium and tail epidermis. Additionally, we also determined the anti-inflammatory effects of JYG in an imiquimod- (IMQ-) induced psoriasis-like skin mouse model. Our results show that JYG can attenuate the IMQ-induced psoriasis-like inflammation, accompanied with increased epidermal hyperplasia. We also measured estrogenic stage mitosis of vaginal epithelial cells and the formation of granular cell layers in male mouse tails per 100 scales, as well as the tissue nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels using the ELISA method. The results suggest that JYG significantly inhibited mitosis in mouse vaginal epithelial cells, promoted the formation of the squamous epidermal granular layer in mice tails, and reduced the levels of NO and MDA in an imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like skin mouse model after 14 d (P < 0.05). These results demonstrate that JYG might be an effective clinical treatment for psoriasis and the effects may be related to inhibited keratinocytes proliferation, improved parakeratotic epidermal cells, and reduced expression of NO and MDA. © 2014 Tian Ma et al.",10.1155/2014/512562

Results suggested that among the single CPAs evaluated 6% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) would be the most suitable for sperm cryopreservation in this species. The highest post-thaw sperm motility was achieved with the sperm that had been exposed to LN vapor for 10. min at 5.2. cm above the LN surface, thawed and recovered in 60 and 18. °C seawater bathes, respectively after at least 2. h storage in LN. The highest fertilization rates were achieved at a sperm to egg ratio of 10,000:1 or 15,000:1. Addition of 1% glucose or 2% sucrose produced significantly higher post-thaw sperm motility than 6% Me2SO alone. Among the three cryoprotectant solutions further trialled, 6% Me2SO. +. 1% glucose produced the highest fertilization rate of 83.6. ±. 3.7%.

The project is situated 75 miles (120 kilometers) southeast of the city of Vitoria, in water depths of 4,921 to 6,562 feet (1,500 to 2,000 meters). During the development of Phase II and III, Shell adopted an innovative integrated approach for the delivery, testing, installation and commissioning of the Subsea Production System. This approach led to significant gains in operational efficiency and overall helped in the optimization of the rig schedule. Some of the critical elements for success of the Project were the alignment of hardware delivery with logistics and custom clearance activities, a fit-for-purpose test facility in Vila Velha, a dedicated Multi Purpose Supply Vessel together with its ROV services, and a dedicated multidisciplinary team which leveraged the optimization of the learning curve through the execution of the project. 17 Tubing Head Spools (THS) and 17 Subsea Trees were successfully installed in water depths up to 1850 m. by Multi-Purpose Support Vessel (MPSV) Holiday in 2 separate campaigns that spanned roughly 2 years. The MPSV with its 150 T Active Heave Compensated (AHC) Crane showed excellent performance in executing its core hardware installation activities, and was then also used on multiple additional Inspection, Maintenance and Repair (IMR) jobs, optimizing the utilization for the specific field development. Most relevant among this peripheral work were: data acquisition from a permanent seabed seismic array, support in a Gas Export line remediation project and repair of a service line jumper. Additionally, for the 7 trees of Phase III, the vessel ROVs participated in commissioning activities, communicating with the tree control system, to anticipate cycling and opening of the downhole isolation valves, resulting in further savings of rig days. For this purpose a project specific ROV kit was arranged to communicate with the tree control pod, provide fail safe double barriers during the intervention, and inject conditioning fluids inside the shallow section of the well bore.

To this end, gametophytes obtained in laboratory cultures were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then defrozen, in order to restart their growth under controlled light, photoperiod and temperature conditions. Thirtyfive days after defreezing, the gametophytes grew normally and matured sexually, differentiating in to male and female gametophytes (53 and 47%, respectively). Once fertilized, the growth and development phase of juveni le sporophytes begins, reaching an average daily growth rate of 10.4%.

Guo F.; Tu R.; Wang W.-X.,Different responses of abalone Haliotis discus hannai to waterborne and dietary-borne copper and zincexposure,2013,Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,91,,10,17,,"To investigate the potential influence of the contamination of copper (Cu) or zinc (Zn), the abalone Haliotis discus hannai was exposed to waterborne or macroalgae-borne Cu or Zn over a period of 8weeks. Both Cu and Zn were effectively accumulated by the abalones from water or macroalgae, but their concentration factors and trophic transfer factors were low due to the regulation of Cu and Zn accumulation. Following waterborne or dietary exposure, the abalones exhibited different accumulation patterns of Cu and Zn. The tissue Zn burden decreased quickly after the initial accumulation, and the incoming Zn was mainly deposited in the viscera. In contrast, the tissue Cu burden increased rapidly and gradually reached a steady state. The abalone muscle exhibited a comparable storage capacity of Cu as the viscera and the accumulated Cu in muscle was mainly derived from the dissolved phase instead of trophic transfer. The feeding and growth of the abalone were not influenced in all the exposure regimes. Moreover, the significant induction of metallothionein indicated that the bioaccumulated metals were actively detoxified. In the metal-exposed abalones, more Cu was distributed into the biologically detoxified fractions (metallothionein-like protein and/or metal-rich granule), whereas no significant subcellular redistribution of Zn was observed. Our study suggested that the abalone may have high endurance to the contamination of Cuor Zn. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.01.002

Thin Layer chromatography (TLC) analysis suggested that the expressed protein encoded by +1 ORF2 was the functional AZ that targets ODC to 26S proteasome degradation. The result demonstrated that the expression level of AZ was higher than that of ODC in the ovary of small abalone. In addition, the expression profiles of ODC and AZ at the different development stages of the ovary indicated that these two genes might be involved in the gonadal development of small abalone. © 2015 Li et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0135251

Proteinase inhibitors play a key role in regulating the activity of the respective proteinases. Among serine proteinase inhibitors, kazal-type proteinase inhibitors (KPIs) are widely found in mammals, avians, and a variety of invertebrates. In this study, we describe the identification of a kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor (Ab-KPI) from the disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus, which is presumably involved in innate immunity. The full-length cDNA of Ab-KPI includes 600bp nucleotides with an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 143 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of Ab-KPI contains a putative 17-amino acid signal peptide and two tandem kazal domains with high similarity to other kazal-type SPIs. Each kazal domain consists of reactive site (P1) residue containing a leucine (L), and a threonine (T) located in the second amino acid position after the second conserved cysteine of each domain. Temporal expression of Ab-KPI was assessed by real time quantitative PCR in hemocytes and mantle tissue following bacterial and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) challenge, and tissue injury. At 6hpost-bacterial and -VHSV challenge, Ab-KPI expression in hemocytes was increased 14-fold and 4-fold, respectively, compared to control samples. The highest up-regulations upon tissue injury were shown at 9h and 12h in hemocytes and mantle, respectively. The transcriptional modulation of Ab-KPI following bacterial and viral challenges and tissue injury indicates that it might be involved in immune defense as well as wound healing process in abalone. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.fsi.2013.07.005

The bacteria were Gramnegative, rod-shaped and motile by means of more than one polar flagellum, oxidase-positive, catalase-positive and able to grow in the presence of 0.5-8.0% NaCl (optimum 3.0-6.0 %) and at 10-37 °C (optimum 25-30 °C). On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) using five loci (2443 bp; gyrB, pyrH, ftsZ, mreB and gapA), the closest phylogenetic neighbours of strain TCFB 0772T were the type strains of Vibrio communis (99.8 and 94.6% similarity, respectively), Vibrio owensii (99.8 and 94.1 %), Vibrio natriegens (99.4 and 88.8 %), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (99.4 and 90.3 %), Vibrio rotiferianus (99.2 and 94.4 %), Vibrio alginolyticus (99.1 and 89.3 %) and Vibrio campbellii (99.1 and 92.3 %). DNA-DNA hybridization confirmed that the six isolates constitute a unique taxon that is distinct from other known species of Vibrio. In addition, this taxon can be readily differentiated phenotypically from other Vibrio species. The six isolates therefore represent a novel species, for which the name Vibrio jasicida sp. nov. is proposed; the novel species is represented by the type strain TCFB 0772T (=JCM 16453T =LMG 25398T) (DNA G+C content 45.9 mol%) and reference strains TCFB 1977 (=JCM 16454) and TCFB 1000 (=JCM 16455). © 2012 IUMS.",10.1099/ijs.0.025916-0

This study was conducted to identify the microalgal species suitable for the growth of early larvae of H. discus hannai. The growth and attachment rates of 31 microalgal species were examined. Acrylic plates were used as the substrate. Among the 31 microalgal species, nine showing high growth and attachment rates were selected and tested for their dietary values via factors including settlement, metamorphosis, and survival rates of abalone larvae. Tetraselmis hazeni and Rhaphoneis sp. induced the highest settlement rate (65-69%) in abalone larvae. The metamorphosis rate was highest (57%) in larvae fed Rhaphoneis sp. and was also significantly higher in larvae fed Oscillatoria splendida (29%) and T. hazeni (22%) than in those fed other species. The highest survival rate of the larvae during the 15 days after metamorphosis was 67% in those fed Rhaphoneis sp., followed by T. hazeni (42%) and O. splendida (35%). In conclusion, Rhaphoneis sp. is the most suitable diatom for use as a live food for the culture of early larvae of H. discus hannai. In addition, T. hazeni and O. splendida are also potential species to be further developed and utilized in larval culture. © The Korean Society of Fisheries and Aquatic Science.",10.5657/FAS.2011.0339
Shakouri B.; Yazdi S.K.,The sustainable marine aquaculture,2012,Advances in Environmental Biology,6,1,18,23,,"Aquaculture is the keeping, breeding, hatching or culturing of fish. Fish used for aquaculture include nonpearl oysters, mussels, yabbies, marron, crayfish, abalone, prawns, freshwater and marine finfish, trochus and algae for beta carotene (ie any marine organism other than reptiles, birds and mammals). Aquaculture has an important role in the development of many national economies and plays a key role in world development. As the expansion of aquaculture product, there is a growing concern over the impacts of aquaculture on the environmental sustainability and also over the requirements on quality and food safety by consumers and regulators. Global wild fisheries are in decline, with valuable habitat such as estuaries in critical condition. The aquaculture or farming of piscivorous fish, like salmon, does not help the problem because they need to eat products from other fish, such as fish meal and fish oil. Apart from fish and shrimp, some aquaculture undertakings, such as seaweed and filterfeeding bivalve mollusks like oysters, clams, mussels and scallops, are relatively benign and even environmentally restorative. Filter-feeders filter pollutants as well as nutrients from the water, improving water quality. Some profitable aquaculture cooperatives promote sustainable practices. New methods lessen the risk of biological and chemical pollution through minimizing fish stress, fallowing netpens, and applying Integrated Pest Management. Vaccines are being used more and more to reduce antibiotic use for disease control. Onshore recirculating aquaculture systems, facilities using polyculture techniques, and properly sited facilities (e.g. offshore areas with strong currents) are examples of ways to manage negative environmental effects. It is a need to improve aquaculture technology and management system to address the need for eco-friendly production process and food safety concerns in the sustainability of national aquaculture. Fisheries Management should be done for job opportunity, and for fisher, farmer and related community welfare, and also for fisheries resources and environmental sustainability. In addition, it is mentioned also that the product from both capture and aquaculture fisheries should meet quality standard and product safety.",

Five semipurified diets with 35gkg-1 total lipid were formulated to contain graded LA/EPA ratios (1:0, 0.75:0.25, 0.5:0.5, 0.25:0.75, and 0:1, respectively). Twenty-five juveniles were stocked in a rearing unit, a plastic basket (20× 20×10cm), as a replicate, and there were three replicates for each dietary treatment. The results showed that abalone survival rates were generally high (90.1-98.3%) and independent of the dietary treatments. However, abalone growth was significantly affected by LA/EPA ratio (P< 0.05). The LA/EPA ratio of 0.25:0.75 (Diet 4) produced the highest weight gain rate (WGR, 416.3%), closely followed by the ratio of 0:1 (Diet 5, 412.9%), the ratio of 0.5:0.5 (Diet 3, 399.7%) and the ratio of 0.75:0.25 (Diet 2, 372.1%), but no significant differences were observed among these treatments. The abalone fed the diet without 20:5n-3 (Diet 1) had the lowest WGR (Diet 1, 363.8%), which was significantly lower than that of Diet 4. Fatty acid profiles in abalone body reflected those of dietary lipids, especially for the polyunsaturated fatty acids. The contents of arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4n-6) in abalone tissues were positively correlated with dietary level of 18:2n-6 (P<0.05). Similar correlation was also observed between the level of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) in abalone tissues and the level of dietary EPA. It is suggested that abalone, H. discus hannai, have the capacity to synthesize 20:4n-6 from 18:2n-6, and maybe 22:6n-3 from 20:5n-3. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1365-2095.2010.00802.x

However, the health beneficial effects of abalone have rarely been reported. In the present study, we examine the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of abalone Haliotis discus hannai in macrophage cells. The results showed that abalone intestine digest (AID) has antioxidant activities against lipid peroxidation, ROS stress and DNA damage in H2O 2-treated RAW264.7 macrophages. In the lipopoly-saccharide (LPS)-induced macrophages, AID suppresses LPS-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in a dose-dependent manner. It also significantly reduced the generation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-6. Furthermore AID significantly suppresses the phosphorylation of mito-gen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as ERK, JNK, and p38. These results indicated that AID inhibits oxidative damage by ROS and LPS-induced inflammatory response via blocking the MAPK signaling pathway in murine macrophages. The potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of abalone intestine as byproducts from fishery manufacturing may suggest the possibility of high valuable utilization and application as a nutraceutical and therapeutic substance. © 2012 The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer.",10.1007/s12257-011-0544-2

The results showed that PAEs could significantly reduce embryo hatchability, increase developmental malformations, and suppress the metamorphosis of abalone larvae. The possible toxicological mechanisms of PAEs to abalone embryos included, affecting the Na+-K+-pump and Ca 2+-Mg2+-pump activities, altering the peroxidase (POD) level and the malondialdehyde (MDA) production, damaging the extraembryonic membranes structure, as well as disrupting endocrine-related genes (gpx, cyp3a, and 17β-hsd 12) expression properties. Taken together, this work showed that PAEs adversely affected the embryonic ontogeny of abalone. The abilities of PAEs affecting the osmoregulation, inducing oxidative stress, damaging embryo envelope structure, and causing physiological homeostasis disorder, are likely to be a part of the common mechanisms responsible for their embryonic toxicity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Vásquez-León M.,"Policies of conservation and sustainable development: Fishing communities in the gulf of California, Mexico",2012,Neoliberalism and Commodity Production in Mexico,,,165,185,,"Since the late 1990s, Mexico's marine fisheries and coastal resources, like much of Mexico's rural sector, have been undergoing deep structural transformations as the country insists on rigorously implementing the neoliberal model. As in much of Latin America, neoliberal reforms have involved macroeconomic, agrarian, and environmental policies. These policies include the privatization of key economic sectors and state-owned industries, the liberalization of markets and establishment of international free trade agreements, major changes to banking and credit systems, the elimination of subsidies, and decentralization of state control. Even though the declared objectives of the neoliberal model are to sustain economic growth, improve life, and combat poverty, its impacts have been rather contradictory, as indicated by the numerous studies produced on the subject (e.g., Harvey 2005; Taylor 2002). The case of marine fisheries and coastal resources in the Gulf of California offers an interesting example of how the neoliberal model has subordinated local economic development efforts and generated a model of intensive and extensive exploitation of natural resources. Parallel to the privatization of ejidos (communally owned properties) in the Mexican agricultural sector (see Haenn 2006), marine fisheries also went through a process of privatization and commoditization. This process contradicts decades of state intervention in which fishers organized in cooperatives that held exclusive rights to capture such commercially valuable species as shrimp, lobster, and abalone. Starting in the 1930s the interests of local fishing cooperatives were represented at the national level by regional federations that formed part of a complex national organizational structure headed by the National Confederation of Cooperatives. Arguing corruption and inefficiency in the cooperative sector, the Carlos Salinas de Gortari administration officially dismantled the cooperative system in 1992. The first sally into the privatization process began in the late 1980s with the closure of the Banco Nacional Pesquero y Portuario (BANPESCA), the statecontrolled fisheries bank. Set up in the 1970s to develop the fishing industry, BANPESCA provided loans to fishing cooperatives for the purchase of boats and equipment at relatively benign rates. Through the 1970s and 1980s loans from BANPESCA led to a sharp increase in the number of shrimp boats, Mexico's most important commercial fishery. As the number of shrimp boats increased, catch per boat and total catch generally declined (see figures 8.1 and 8.2). By the end of the decade most cooperatives found themselves unable to repay their loans. This provided the justification to close the bank in the midst of allegations of corruption within the bank itself. The closure of BANPESCA crippled the fishing cooperatives, forcing many into bankruptcy and preparing the stage for privatization of the sector.1 In 1992, fishing rights to reserved species were transferred to private investors. The implementation of neoliberal reforms led to a considerable loss of local control over resources as small-scale and offshore fishers lost political representation and negotiating power with financial institutions, the private sector, and the state (Alcala 2003; Vasquez-Leon and McGuire 1994). At the same time, a strong trend toward conservation was set in motion in 1993 with the approval of the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation, an environmental side accord that addressed the lack of environmental provisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Under the arguments of resource overexploitation and an increase in the number of endangered species, a number of highly productive marine regions have been declared protected areas (Arbuto-Oropeza and Lopez-Sagastegui 2006), changing the legal status of fishing communities that in some cases are excluded from traditional fishing grounds (McGuire and Greenberg 1993). Today, as Daniel Lluch-Cota and colleagues (2007:2) point out, the Gulf of California is ""one of the marine systems most closely watched by the worldwide conservation sector."" By contrast, despite general concern over resource decline, the passage of NAFTA-a key piece in engineering neoliberal goals of free trade-made it easier for private investors, both Mexican and foreign, to invest in such capital-intensive enterprises as shrimp aquaculture and tourism infrastructure. As projected by the Mexican government, 30 percent of the once remote Gulf coastline would be under intensive economic use by 2010 (Diario Oficial 2006); this, in fact, did happen. These developments, as I shall discuss, increase pressures on marine and coastal resources and displace fishing communities, and they are unlikely to contribute in any substantial way to the economic well-being of local fishing households and communities. Instead, since the early 1990s, disputes among strong economic interests have led to conflicting views as to who should benefit from the region's resources. In this chapter I focus on the impact of neoliberal reform policies on the Gulf of California's small-scale fishers. These policies include privatization of marine and coastal resources, ""sustainable development"" strategies promoted by the state and private capital, changes in the structure of markets, and loss of credit and basic social services for small-scale producers. Socioeconomic studies in the Gulf of California since the early 1990s (Aubert 1997; Fernandez 2003; Greenberg 2006 [1998]; Lozano-Montes, Pitcher, and Haggan 2008; McGuire and Greenberg 1993; Vasquez-Leon 1995) have identified a progressive deterioration of the economies of marine-dependent communities and a decline in the productivity of a variety of commercial fisheries. After more than a decade of neoliberal reforms, poverty and resource scarcity have worsened, and today small-scale fishing households are being pressured to the point where marine-dependent livelihoods are becoming unviable. Even though neoliberal reforms-including environmental policies-have been undertaken in the name of efficiency and sustainability, fishers find themselves increasingly vulnerable as the state withdraws support for this sector in favor of industrial producers in offshore fisheries and shrimp aquaculture, tourism development, and conservationist concerns. I begin by examining the major problems impacting fishing communities in the Gulf of California. I then analyze the solutions proposed by the state, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and local communities to revive economies and conserve resources. Finally, I focus on traditional small-scale fishers and their communities to show how they perceive and are impacted by the problems and the proposed solutions. The problems discussed in this chapter are not unique to small-scale fishers in the Gulf of California; in Mexico, small-scale producers in other rural sectors are facing similar challenges (Haenn 2006; Vasquez-Leon and Liverman 2004; in this volume see Greenberg on coffee, Carter and Alexander on grapes, Weaver on forestry, and Emmanuel on ranching). © 2012 by University Press of Colorado.

In this study, a novel TLR homolog from disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) was identified and characterized at molecular level. The open reading frame (ORF) of AbTLR is 3804bp in length and encodes a 1268 amino acid peptide with a calculated molecular mass of 143.5kDa. The deduced protein shows typical TLR domain architecture, with leucine rich repeats (LRR) and the toll-interleukin receptor (TIR) domain. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close evolutionary relationship for AbTLR to its invertebrate counterparts, with close clustering to the molluscan homologs. Quantitative real-time PCR detected ubiquitous transcription of AbTLR in healthy tissues, but with highest levels in hemocytes. Differential transcriptional modulation of AbTLR was observed in abalone hemocytes and gills upon immune challenge, whereby Vibrio parahaemolyticus and purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced the transcript level prominently. In addition, the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus induced AbTLR transcription in hemocytes and gills, representing the first evidence of viral-induced immune response in mollusks to date.

Under applied stress these components slide on one another, generating inelastic deformations and toughness at the macroscale. This mechanism is prominent in nacre, a remarkable material which is now serving as model for biomimetic materials. In this work the microstructure, performance and mechanics of nacres from four species (red abalone, top shell, pearl oyster and pen shell) were determined and compared in order to gain new insights into structure-performance relationships in staggered structures. Fracture tests revealed that all nacres display a rising crack resistance curve, but that some nacres are tougher than the others. In addition all nacres generated inelastic deformations ahead of the crack tip, whose size correlated well with the amount of toughening, which confirmed that energy dissipation in these inelastic regions is a prominent source of toughness. Nacre from pearl oyster was found to be the toughest, suggesting it as a potential model for biomimetic materials. For the first time remarkable deformation and fracture patterns were observed in that material using in-situ optical and atomic force microscopy. Under stress, stair-like thin deformation bands deform at an angle from the loading direction, forming a dense, tree-like network. This marks a clear difference from the now well documented ""columnar"" failure mode observed in red abalone, where deformation bands perpendicular to the loading direction form homogeneous inelastic region. A micromechanics model revealed that the transition between columnar and stair failure modes is controlled by the amount of overlap between the tablets and local shear stresses induced by inhomogeneities in the material. Large scale numerical models of staggered structures confirmed this observation. Similar ""stair"" failure scenario may also occur in bone, which has a microstructure in many ways similar to sheet nacre.",
Hu Z.; Lee J.W.; Chandran K.; Kim S.; Khanal S.K.,Nitrous oxide (N 2O) emission from aquaculture: A review,2012,Environmental Science and Technology,46,12,6470,6480,,"Nitrous oxide (N 2O) is an important greenhouse gas (GHG) which has a global warming potential 310 times that of carbon dioxide (CO 2) over a hundred year lifespan. N 2O is generated during microbial nitrification and denitrification, which are common in aquaculture systems. To date, few studies have been conducted to quantify N 2O emission from aquaculture. Additionally, very little is known with respect to the microbial pathways through which N 2O is formed in aquaculture systems. This review suggests that aquaculture can be an important anthropogenic source of N 2O emission. The global N 2O-N emission from aquaculture in 2009 is estimated to be 9.30 x 10 10 g, and will increase to 3.83 x 10 11g which could account for 5.72% of anthropogenic N 2O-N emission by 2030 if the aquaculture industry continues to increase at the present annual growth rate (about 7.10%). The possible mechanisms and various factors affecting N 2O production are summarized, and two possible methods to minimize N 2O emission, namely aquaponic and biofloc technology aquaculture, are also discussed. The paper concludes with future research directions. (Figure Presented). © 2012 American Chemical Society.",10.1021/es300110x

Several studies have been conducted on the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of seafood allergy in different countries, and some of the fish and seafood allergens unique to those regions have been characterized. Review on published data showed that seafood allergy is very ubiquitous in some regions of the world. Fish and shellfish are the most common seafood that cause adverse allergic reactions among nations; the symptoms ranged from oral allergy syndromes to urticaria and anaphylaxis. The major identified allergens are parvalbumin in fish and tropomyosin in shellfish. Nevertheless, such studies are lacking from some regions with high fish and seafood consumption. Furthermore, the published data are mostly from small groups of populations, which large-scale epidemiological studies need to be performed. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",10.1007/s12016-011-8284-9

Relative to the mainland and other Channel Islands, San Miguel Island (SMI) consistently maintains cooler water temperatures and supports significant populations of red abalone Haliotis rufescens, presumably owing to increased food production and diminished expression of the bacterial disease known as withering syndrome.We conducted a laboratory experiment to examine the effects of La Nĩna and El Nĩno conditions on the health and survival of red abalone from SMI. Six replicate tanks per treatment, each containing six abalone, were subjected to one of the following three temperature regimes (treatments): Bodega Bay, California ambient (AMB; mean, 11.4°C), SMI La Nĩna regime (LAN; mean, 13.8°C), and SMI El Nĩno regime (ELN; mean, 16.5°C). After 328 d, survival in the ELN treatment was significantly lower than in the AMB and LAN groups. A body condition index was significantly lower in the ELN group than in the AMB group, and the LAN group was in between. A visual score of body shrinkage was significantly higher in both the LAN and ELN groups than in the AMB group. Other clinical signs of withering syndrome and the prevalence and infection intensity of the causative agent, Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis, increased as temperature increased in the three treatment groups from AMB to LAN to ELN, although the differences were not statistically significant. Generally, we found that increased temperature resulted in elevated disease expression, although less than observed in previous studies that used farmed abalone and higher, less variable temperature regimes.Water temperature modulates the effect of withering syndrome in wild red abalone, and very strong El Nĩno events are predicted to result in significant mortality at San Miguel Island. © American Fisheries Society 2011.",10.1080/08997659.2011.568860
Ojima T.,Polysaccharide-degrading enzymes from herbivorous marine invertebrates,2013,"Marine Enzymes for Biocatalysis: Sources, Biocatalytic Characteristics and Bioprocesses of Marine Enzymes",,,333,371,,"Herbivorous marine molluscs such as abalone, sea hare and small snails possess various kinds of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes that efficiently depolymerize seaweed polysaccharides, e.g., alginate, mannan, laminarin and cellulose. These enzymes play important roles in the molluscs to digest seaweed fronds and obtain oligosaccharides and monosaccharides as carbohydrate nutrients. On the other hand, such seaweed poly- and oligosaccharides are known to exhibit various beneficial functions on humans, e.g., easing intestinal disorders, mollification of blood-sugar increase, antitumor and antihypertensive functions. In addition, such seaweed saccharides are recognized as potential raw materials for biofuels that will not cause serious conflicts between foods and fuels, unlike land crops. In this context, enzymes that can degrade seaweed polysaccharides are regarded as key biocatalysts for the production of value-added carbohydrates from seaweed. The enzymes from herbivorous marine molluscs appear to have some advantageous properties compared with the enzymes from terrestrial organisms since the molluscan enzymes should have evolved under the seaweed-feeding constraints of the animals. Therefore, investigation for such enzymes would provide us with useful information about how we should digest seaweed to produce value-added oligo- and monosaccharides in a reasonable way. In this chapter, we review the general properties of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes of herbivorous molluscs, specially focusing on alginate lyase, mannanase, laminarinase and cellulase. © 2013 Woodhead Publishing Limited.

Here, we described the characterization and expression analysis of the first TNF-α homologue in mollusk abalone, named as AbTNF-α. It has 930-bp full length with a 717-bp open reading frame (ORF), encoding 239 amino acids. The AbTNF-α amino acid sequence shows the characteristic TNF family signature, N-terminal transmembrane domain consisting of a hydrophobic amino acid cluster and cell attachment sequence at 155RGD157. Phylogenic analysis results showed that AbTNF-α is more related to the invertebrate Ciona savignyi TNF superfamily ligand member (CsTL). Quantitative real-time PCR expression results showed that AbTNF-α was constitutively expressed in both immune and non-immune tissues in a tissue specific manner. The highest constitutive expression was in the gill tissue with a 1.5-fold compared to hemocytes expression. The AbTNF-α mRNA expression in gill tissue was monitored in vivo stimulated by a mixture of pathogenic bacteria (Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahemolyticus, and Lysteria monocytogenes), viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The AbTNF-α expression was significantly (p < 0.05) induced by bacteria, VHSV and LPS compared to the control animals. Moreover, the highest level expressions of each induction were at 24 h (5.2-fold), 48 h (2.8-fold), and 48 h (3.3-fold) by bacteria mixture, VHSV and LPS, respectively. These results indicate that AbTNF-α could respond to pathogenic infection or stimulation and may play an important role in the abalone immune system. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The cephalic, epipodial and mantle tentacles bear papillae with ciliary tufts at their tips. Chemoreceptors with 14-21 ciliated cells were found at high density on the snout. When the tentacles were touched with a bamboo rodor a piece of plastic sheet, the abalone contracted the tentacle stimulated, indicating mechanoreception. The contact of a piece of brown algae Laminaria japonica to any of three tentacles elicited a typical feeding response: shell lifting, pedal sole expansion and lifting, and food seizing with pedal sole. The response disappeared when the algae was separated from the tentacles, indicating that the ciliated cells were contact chemoreceptors as well as mechanoreceptors. A possibility of distant chemoreception was examined in a Y-maze in which seawater flowed over the algae and was directed towards the abalone. The algal stimulant triggered the food searching movement of the abalone which randomly chose both the stimulant containing water from the algal containing side and the control water without stimulant. This implies the possession of distant chemoreception possibly by the osphradium, but the abalone lacks a function to detect the origin of the smell.",10.2331/suisan.76.185

The size of the plastic cages used throughout this experiment was 30×40×30 cm. During the experiment, a pre-determined amount of seaweed (Gracilaria verrucosa) was added to feed the animals once every 2-3 d. Water quality measurements were taken weekly and the mortality rate of abalone was observed in the morning. In the first experiment, four stocking densities (40,60,80, and 100 pieces/cage) with ten replicates were used. After six months, growth in terms of shell length and total weight of abalone at 60 pes/cage were the highest with values of 35.5 ± 2.8 mm, and 13.5 ± 3.3 g, respectively. The survival rate (78.2%) at this stocking density was also the highest. The stocking density of 60 pes/cage was chosen for the second experiment, where abalone of three initial size ranges (4-5, 7-8, and 10-11 mm) in shell length were investigated in the same manner as the first experiment. It was found that abalone with an initial size range of 10-11 mm showed the best survival rate (82%) compared with 4-5 mm (46.2%) and 7-8 mm (64.8%). Consequently, it is suggested that abalone with an initial size range of 10-11 mm in shell length should be stocked at a density of 60 pes/cage for the first six months of the grow-out period using the suspended plastic cages system.",

During an experiment to determine the effect of photoperiod and temperature on the growth of juvenile blue abalone Haliotis fulgens, some animals showed overt symptoms of WS. Oxytetracycline baths at 400 mg L-1 were used for one hour daily during seven days to treat diseased animals. The metabolic rate of one group of these organisms was also assessed.

Whether the defense capacity in these seaweeds is generally impaired by low-light stress was also investigated. Aquaria with blackened walls connected to a flow-through water system were used as Experimental Units (EUs). Different light regimes were established using layers of black gauze material and clear perspex lids, mounted on top of the EU. The gauze allowed the stepwise reduction of ambient light. Six different light levels with eight replicates each were realised. The growth rates of algal exposed to different light levels were calculated using a linear regression analysis. Using outdoor mesocosm facilities, three fully-factorial experiments were realised during which low-light stress on different algae-grazer combinations was induced: 1) the red algae Gracilaria edulis with the sea hare Aplysia sp., 2) G. edulis with the abalone Haliotis diversicolor, and 3) Gracilaria salicornia with H. diversicolor. For each combination, 48 aquaria were used, while in a control group of another 48 tanks, algae were kept in the absence of herbivores. Following low-light and feeding-stress induction, herbivore consumption on algal material was assessed in feeding assays with living thalli fragments. Negative effects of light reduction on algal growth rates was observed in both experiments with G. edulis and in one trial with G. salicornia, while general effects of low-light stress on seaweed palatability were absent in our study. By contrast, for some herbivore-algal combinations, significant differences in consumption were detected on previously-grazed and ungrazed algal material, that indicates the presence of an inducible defense. G. edulis and G. salicornia produced defenses when exposed to grazing by the gastropod Aplysia sp. and H. diversicolor, respectively. In contrast, G. edulis showed no response to H. diversicolor. Our findings show that inducible defenses generally exist in the two investigated Gracilaria species, but vary with the identity of herbivores. Surprisingly, algal palatability was not affected throughout all low-light regimes, contrasting the widespread notion that defensive traits in seaweeds are dependent on metabolic energy. Thus, it appears that low-light stress effects play only a minor role on the performance of antiherbivore defenses in these two red algae.",

Voultsiadou Eleni E.,Therapeutic properties and uses of marine invertebrates in the ancient Greek world and early Byzantium,2010,Journal of Ethnopharmacology,130,2,237,247,,"Aim of the study: Marine organisms are currently investigated for the therapeutic potential of their natural products with very promising results. The human interest for their use in healing practices in the Eastern Mediterranean goes back to the antiquity. An attempt is made in the present work to investigate the therapeutic properties of marine invertebrates and the ways they were used in the medical practice during the dawn of the western medicine. Methods: The classical Greek texts of the Ancient Greek (Classical, Hellenistic and Roman) and early Byzantine period were studied and the data collected were analysed in order to extract detailed information on the parts of animal bodies and the ways they were used for healing purposes. Results and discussion: Thirty-eight marine invertebrates were recorded for their therapeutic properties and uses in 40 works of 20 classical authors, covering a time period of 11 centuries (5th c. BC to 7th c. AD). The identified taxa were classified into 7 phyla and 11 classes of the animal kingdom, while molluscs were the dominant group. Marine invertebrates were more frequently used for their properties relevant to digestive, genitourinary and skin disorders. Flesh, broth, skeleton, or other special body parts of the animals were prepared as drinks, collyria, suppositories, cataplasms, compresses, etc. Conclusions: Marine invertebrates were well known for their therapeutic properties and had a prominent role in the medical practice during the Ancient Greek and the early Byzantine period. The diversity of animal species and their medicinal uses reflect the maritime nature of the Greek civilization, which flourished on the coasts and islands of the Aegean Sea. Most of them were common species exploited by humans for food or other everyday uses. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",10.1016/j.jep.2010.04.041
Hellyer R.,Poor but not pirates: The Tsushima domain and foreign relations in early modern Japan,2010,"Elusive Pirates, Pervasive Smugglers: Violence and Clandestine Trade in the Greater China Seas",,,115,126,,"Over the past few decades, historians have demonstrated that, during the Edo period (1603-1868), Japan pursued foreign relations policies very much in tune with its Asian neighbors. For one, Arano Yasunori has illustrated how Japanese leaders restricted overseas trade and the movement of foreign merchants, took measures to stamp out Christianity, and established diplomatic protocols in ways that mirrored those of their counterparts throughout East and Southeast Asia.1 Despite these similarities, by the early nineteenth century, Japan had in one respect become exceptional in Asia and, for that matter, in the world. It was free of maritime pirates, namely, individuals or groups who use violence or the threat of violence to commandeer shipping or to attack coastal settlements. In the decades after 1800, pirates infested the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, and, as explored in other chapters in this volume, the coast of China to the Gulf of Tonkin, as well as the waters around Singapore. One would assume that maritime piracy would also have plagued Japan, a state with few coastal defenses and no navy. Yet, as I have noted elsewhere, official documents rarely mention piracy.2 A report of an incident in Japan's Inland Sea in 1870, for example, provides the only direct reference to pirates in Japanese waters in the ""Dai Nihon Ishin Shiryō Kōhon,"" the most comprehensive collection of central and local government records chronicling events from 1846 to 1872, the unsettled period surrounding the Meiji Restoration of 1868.3 Others, such as Tsukō ichiran zokushu, a five-volume compilation of all types of Japanese intercourse with foreigners in the first decades of the nineteenth century, also register no attacks by pirates in the nineteenth century on either coastal settlements or shipping.4 The absence of piracy is intriguing particularly given the long history of such activity in Japanese waters spanning the period from the fourteenth to the late sixteenth centuries. As the chapters by Peter Shapinsky and Maria Grazia Petrucci show, sea-based, marginal groups used violence as one tool to carve out political and economic power and authority in the Inland Sea. In addition, James Chin highlights the important role that Japanese merchants played in sixteenth-century transnational trading networks headed by Chinese who engaged in piracy and smuggling simultaneously. He notes that some of these ""merchant-pirates,"" based in Kyushu, developed ties with, among others, traders-cum-pirates from Satsuma, a feudal domain in the southern part of the island. In the seventeenth century, however, Satsuma turned away from piracy. Like other Japanese coastal provinces, Satsuma did not return to it, even as political turmoil and increased trade in the first half of the nineteenth century created an environment where pirates conceivably could have prospered (see Map 9.1). As I have argued elsewhere, Satsuma, instead, chose smuggling, establishing a broad network of domestic and overseas partners extending in the south from Ryukyu (present-day Okinawa prefecture), an island kingdom dominated by Satsuma during the Edo period, to Ezo (present-day Hokkaido), then the northern frontier of the Japanese state. Unlike pirates, who use violence to seize goods, smugglers try to circumvent established commercial channels, often with the help of others, thereby engaging in activities that violate state laws or restrictions, in this case, regulations imposed by Japan's central authority, the Tokugawa shogunate (bakufu). At ports on the Japan Sea coast, Satsuma ships illicitly traded Ryukyu sugar and Satsuma goods for marine products, primarily kelp, sea cucumbers, and abalone, harvested in Ezo. In clandestine exchanges with Chinese ships that arrived on domain shores, Satsuma used these products to obtain Chinese and Southeast Asian pharmacopeia, in high demand on the Japanese home market.5 In sum, Satsuma leaders anticipated piracy by reducing the opportunities for individuals to extract goods from coastal shipping and settlements by force. They also incorporated into their burgeoning commercial network domestic and foreign groups that might otherwise have organized fishermen or coastal merchants into pirate bands to raid the Japanese coastline. In a broader sense, the case of Satsuma reveals first, the vigor of a Japanese domestic market that produced a range of goods which buoyed maritime trade. Second, it demonstrates the viability of Japanese- Chinese trade in the early nineteenth century, particularly outside the long established trade center of Nagasaki in Kyushu.6 This chapter explores further the absence of piracy in late Edo period Japan by considering the situation of the Tsushima domain, a feudal fief on the island of the same name located in the straits between Kyushu and Korea. Tsushima provides, in many ways, an even more interesting case study. First, because of the domain's history: from the early fourteenth to the mid-sixteenth century, the island served, at varying levels of intensity, as a base for pirate bands which attacked especially the Korean coast (only fifty kilometers away, half the distance to the nearest Kyushu port of Hakata). Second, owing to its key role in smoothing relations between the shogunate and the Korean court, Tsushima enjoyed a high level of agency - the ability to exercise discretionary authority in trade, diplomacy, and defense - which offered a potential platform to facilitate piracy. Third, beginning in the second half of the eighteenth century, Tsushima leaders faced a crippled domain economy resulting chiefly from a decline in trade revenues, but also from poor agricultural production. This dire economic situation conceivably could have prompted Tsushima leaders to resort to piracy. Finally, they had numerous opportunities to undertake piracy in league with the Western merchants whose ships increasingly visited its shores after 1846. Yet, despite all of these potential reasons, Tsushima leaders and the island's denizens did not choose the path of piracy. As this chapter outlines below, the domain's established relationships with Korea and the shogunate, particularly the financial grants offered by both authorities, made a move to piracy less appealing. Moreover, domain officials viewed the Westerners calling at its harbors more as possible enemies than as potential partners for piratical schemes. Indeed, as the visits of Western ships multiplied, domain leaders sought to abrogate the agency Tsushima enjoyed in relations with Korea and, instead, to enhance its place within the larger defensive system of the Japanese realm. Overall, Tsushima leaders aimed to incorporate their territory more into existing Japanese state structures than to chart an independent course in defense and trade. © 2010 by Hong Kong University Press, HKU.

The effect of these two factors on postlarval grazing rate, survival, and growth was evaluated. The experiment was conducted for 14 days in 10-mL sterile wells following a split-plot experimental design with three replicates per treatment. The highest grazing rate was observed in the 2000 cells mm-2 density treatment and it was higher in darkness (196 ± 67 cells pl-1 h-1) than in constant light (139 ± 36 cells pl-1 h-1). Mean survival was also higher in darkness (59%) than under constant light (44%), as was mean growth rate (20 and 14 μm d-1, respectively). Growth rate at the end of the experimental period tended to decrease with the increase in diatom density. Higher grazing and growth rates in darkness reinforce the hypothesis that the nocturnal habits of abalone develop soon after metamorphosis and not at juvenile stages as usually considered.",10.7773/cm.v35i1.1446

On day 5, significantly higher number of larvae settled on PP+CCA fed with mixed diatoms followed by Amphora sp., N. ramosissima, Amphora sp. + N. ramosissima, and abalone larvae reared on PP-CCA fed with N. ramosissima only. Fewer larvae settled on PP-CCA fed with Amphora + N. ramosissima, Amphora sp. and mixed diatoms. The size of abalone juveniles from PP-CCA was significantly bigger compared with juveniles measured from PP+CCA. However, the number of juveniles harvested from tanks provided with PP+CCA was higher compared with tanks with PP-CCA. This study has shown that crustose coralline algae favored the settlement of H. asinina larvae and inoculation of diatom slurry is necessary to provide sufficient food for the growing larvae.",

The morphological features of blood cells were described according to the observations made by light microscopy of Wright-Giemsa-stained blood films. The reference intervals and the mean value were determined for each hematological parameter evaluated in healthy fish and data were compared to those of naturally infected, with dactylogyrid monogeneans fish.Infected fish showed a prevalence of 100% and a mean intensity of 246.6 parasites per fish. Mean values of HCT, WBC, thrombocytes percentage and eosinophils percentage were significantly higher (P< 0.05) in the infected fish. In addition, lymphocytes percentage and total protein were significantly lower (P< 0.05) in the infected fish compared to healthy fish. Only total WBC count, lymphocytes percentage and eosinophils percentage in infected fish were outside reference interval. The hematology of the spotted rose snapper of this study might serve as a basis for future studies and diagnosis. Changes observed in blood parameters in infected fish suggest that the immune system of L. guttatus was affected by the presence of the parasites. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.tice.2011.01.002

Although the nutritional importance of abalone has been reported through in vitro and in vivo studies, there is little evidence about the potential anti-tumor effects of abalone visceral extract. The aim of the present study is to examine anti-tumor efficacy of abalone visceral extract and to elucidate its working mechanism.Methods: In the present study, we used breast cancer model using BALB/c mouse-derived 4T1 mammary carcinoma and investigated the effect of abalone visceral extract on tumor development. Inhibitory effect against tumor metastasis was assessed by histopathology of lungs. Cox-2 productions by primary and secondary tumor were measured by real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting (IB). Proliferation assay based on [3H]-thymidine incorporation and measurement of cytokines and effector molecules by RT-PCR were used to confirm tumor suppression efficacy of abalone visceral extract by modulating cytolytic CD8+ T cells. The cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cell was compared by JAM test.Results: Oral administration of abalone visceral extract reduced tumor growth (tumor volume and weight) and showed reduced metastasis as confirmed by decreased level of splenomegaly (spleen size and weight) and histological analysis of the lung metastasis (gross analysis and histological staining). Reduced expression of Cox-2 (mRNA and protein) from primary tumor and metastasized lung was also detected. In addition, treatment of abalone visceral extract increased anti-tumor activities of CD8+ T cells by increasing the proliferation capacity and their cytolytic activity.Conclusions: Our results suggest that abalone visceral extract has anti-tumor effects by suppressing tumor growth and lung metastasis through decreasing Cox-2 expression level as well as promoting proliferation and cytolytic function of CD8+ T cells. © 2010 Lee et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1472-6882-10-60
Tung C.-H.; Alfaro A.C.,Effects of dietary protein source and amount on shell morphology of juvenile abalone Haliotis iris,2011,Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Science,6,2,107,118,,"The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of dietary nutritional value (protein source and amount) and temperature on shell morphology of cultured abalone juveniles. Morphological variations have long been used by ecologists and evolutionary biologists to identify physiological and/or environmental conditions associated with the growth and health of organisms. Two important factors affecting morphological plasticity are food supply and temperature conditions. Two different experiments were conducted to test the effect of dietary protein (source and amount) and water temperature on shell morphology (length, width, height, thickness and weight) of juvenile abalone (Haliotis iris). In the first experiment, nine different dietary protein sources (white fish and red fish meals, blood meal, meat and bone meal, casein, soybean concentrate, wheat gluten, maize gluten and Spirulina powder) resulted in wider, higher and heavier shells with casein diets and flatter shells with red fish meal. Abalone fed blood meal produced significantly narrower, thinner and lighter shells compared to animals fed the other diets. In the second experiment, six different dietary protein amounts (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 45%) and two temperature regimes (13-21 and 8-16°C) resulted in wider and heavier shells with increasing protein content. However, shell height and thickness were not affected by different protein amounts. Significant differences between temperatures were observed only for shell height and thickness. The results suggest that diet and temperature may be used to manipulate abalone shell morphology in aquaculture environments and they may be potential factors in shell variations of wild populations. © 2011 Academic Journals Inc.",10.3923/jfas.2011.107.118

Abalone intestines are one of the by-products of abalone processing. To investigate abalone intestines as bioactive substances, abalone intestine gastrointestinal digests (AIGIDs) of various molecular weights (MWs) were prepared using in vitro gastrointestinal digestion and an ultrafiltration system, and tested for inhibitory effects against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in macrophage cells treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In our results, among AIGIDs, AIGID-III (MW=5-10 kDa) showed potent inhimtory activities for lipid peroxidation and free radicals. Additionally, the results clearly indicated that AIGID-III treatment could prevent cytotoxic damage of macrophages by H2O2-induced oxidative stress due to its potent scavenging ability against cellular ROS. These results suggest that AIGIDs may have protective and therapeutic potential for oxidative stress syndromes and immune diseases through ROS inhibition in macrophage cells.",10.5657/fas.2010.13.3.216

Recently, a homologue of Rel\NF-κB transcription factor was identified from a gastropod abalone, Haliotis diversicolor supertexta, named Ab-Rel. We present here a new strategy, so called magnetocapture, based on magnetic separation that was developed to isolate and detect this abalone transcriptional factor. With this method, Ab-Rel was successfully isolated from abalone haemocytes and the recombinant Ab-Rel protein from an insect cell line. Western blot analysis was performed to verify the effectiveness of this magnetocapture assay. Since only the activated NF-κB can be captured and separated from the whole cell extracts, this method was simultaneously used to detect the NF-κB activity in vivo, as well as the biological activity of the recombinant protein in vitro. In addition, several proteins which might interact with the abalone NF-κB were together isolated, suggesting that the magnetocapture method would be useful for identifying interaction molecules. These results illustrated that the magnetocapture strategy is rapid, reliable and versatile, providing a promising tool for studying Rel\NF-κB protein. © 2006.",10.1016/j.jbiotec.2006.07.025
Baldwin J.; Elias J.P.; Wells R.M.G.; Donovan D.A.,"Energy metabolism in the tropical abalone, Haliotis asinina Linné: Comparisons with temperate abalone species",2007,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,342,2,213,225,,"The abalone, Haliotis asinina, is a large, highly active tropical abalone that feeds at night on shallow coral reefs where oxygen levels of the water may be low and the animals can be exposed to air. It is capable of more prolonged and rapid exercise than has been reported for temperate abalone. These unusual behaviours raised the question of whether H. asinina possesses enhanced capacities for aerobic or anaerobic metabolism. The blood oxygen transport system of H. asinina resembles that of temperate abalone in terms of a large hemolymph volume, similar hemocyanin concentrations, and in most hemocyanin oxygen binding properties; however, absence of a Root effect appears confined to hemocyanin from H. asinina and may assist oxygen uptake when hemolymph pH falls during exercise or environmental hypoxia. During exposure to air, H. asinina reduces oxygen uptake by at least 20-fold relative to animals at rest in aerated seawater, and there is no significant ATP production from anaerobic glycolysis or phosphagen hydrolysis in the foot or adductor muscles. This slowing of metabolism may contribute to survival at lower water oxygen levels than normally encountered by most temperate abalone. While crawling speeds of H. asinina in water are not exceptionally high, an aerobic expansibility of 5.5-fold at speeds less than 20% of maximum is more than 2.7-fold greater than reported for several temperate abalone. The high aerobic expansibility also supports the enhanced frequency and duration of flipping behaviour without recourse to the additional inputs from anaerobic glycolysis required by other abalone. Metabolic profiles of foot and adductor muscles of H. asinina are similar to those of other abalone. Common features are low activities of enzymes unique to aerobic ATP production, relatively high activities of arginine kinase, tauropine and d-lactate dehydrogenase as the predominant pyruvate reductases, and low intracellular pH buffering capacities. It is concluded that the exceptional abilities of H. asinina for prolonged and rapid exercise are supported by higher rates of aerobic metabolism rather than any enhanced capacity for anaerobic muscle work. It is unexpected, and instructive, that the exceptional aerobic expansibility is not apparent in obvious adjustments of the blood oxygen delivery system or muscle properties associated with aerobic ATP production. The absence of a hemocyanin Root effect, and the extent to which both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism can be reduced may be special features that assist prolonged exercise and survival of H. asinina when environmental oxygen becomes limiting. © 2007.",10.1016/j.jembe.2006.09.005

The number of positive NS cells, and the intensity of staining in the ganglia, varied and might be related to the stage of ovarian cycle. At any stage, positive cells were most numerous in the pleuropedal, and least numerous in the visceral ganglion. In addition, several cells of the statocyst and associated nerves also exhibited the immunoreactivity. In the ovary, the most intense reactivity was detected in the follicular and granular cells adjacent to mature oocytes, in the trabeculae and the ovarian capsule. The cytoplasm of mature oocytes was also moderately stained. The results indicate that the cerebral, pleuropedal, and visceral ganglia are the main sites of aELH-producing cells.

Methods: Totally 93 cases were randomly divided into a control group of 31 cases taking Enalapril and a treatment group of 62 cases taking Enalapril and Yixin Jiangya Capsules. Results: Fasting serum insulin (FSI) and TNF-α obviously increased and insulin sensitive index (ISI) significantly decreased in both groups before treatment as compared to those of a healthy group. After treatment, FSI, TNF-α and fasting blood glucose (FBG) obviously decreased and ISI remarkably increased in the treatment group, while ISI significantly increased and TNF-α obviously decreased in the control group. The curative effect in the treatment group was remarkably superior to that in the control group. FSI was positively related to TNF-α before treatment in both groups. Conclusion: FSI and TNF-α obviously increase and ISI significantly decreases in patients with primary hypertension with LVH.

To provide the red algal species in a diet suitable for juvenile abalone three propagation methods; spore production, protoplast isolation, and fragment culture were investigated. The potential algae requirements and consumable costs for each propagation method were determined, using experimental data and values from the literature, to assess the viability of utilizing each of these propagation methods in a commercial abalone nursery. The use of red algal spores required 592-52,000 kg of algae, depending on the level of spore release and the percentage of fertile algal thalli collected. Protoplast isolation reduced the amount of algal biomass to 8.55-910 kg but was affected by the efficiency of the isolation procedure. Even at an efficient production of 1 × 108 protoplasts·g-1 wet weight alga the cost of consumables (enzymes) was $US 13,576. A feeding trial utilizing Laureneia sp. fragments adhered to the plates using agar, produced juvenile abalone growth rates comparable to those obtained with the current commercial nursery diet of the green alga Ulvella lens plus the diatom Navicula cf. jeffreyi. The Laurencia fragments did not regenerate on the plates so it was reapplied weekly, which is not feasible on a commercial scale because it would require 10.6 t of Laureneia and 443 kg of agar at a cost of $US 34,899. Gracilaria sp. fragments were able to regenerate with a growth rate of 4.42%·day-1 and therefore the algal fragments would only need to be applied to the PVC plates once, at the start of the later nursery phase (5 mm SL), reducing the amount of algal biomass to 432 kg. We therefore conclude that regenerating fragment culture (fragments <1 mm) is the only method that could successfully produce red algal diets for juvenile abalone on a commercial scale in the later nursery phase.",10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[737:TAPMAT]2.0.CO;2

Skin prick tests and blood test for specific IgE antibodies were positive for many kinds of seafood, including sole, horse mackerel, sea eel, eel, crab, and abalone, which belonged to different taxonomic phyla, including Chordata, Arthropoda, and Mollusca. A challenge with a piece of broiled sole induced swelling of the lips, obstruction of the larynx, difficulty with deglutition, and abdominal pain. In addition, serum-specific IgE antibodies to two major fish allergens, parvalbumin and collagen, were detected by ELISA, suggesting that allergic symptoms could be induced by many kinds of seafood in the present patient. She was therefore diagnosed with occupational contact urticaria and oral allergy syndrome due to seafood. At the time of this report, the present patient had been followed for one year and no reactions have occurred since she started to avoid the causative types of seafood.",

The growth, survival and grazing rates of juvenile Haliotis laevigata Donovan, 1808 were monitored in response to the density and biochemical composition of N. jeffreyi cultured in each of the six treatments. Navicula jeffreyi Hallegraeff et Burford grown in high light had a proportionally lower protein content and a higher carbohydrate and fat content (22 ± 0.6%; 17.6 ± 1.5%; 7.5 ± 0.7%, respectively) compared to the content of diatoms grown in low light (30 ± 0.6%; 14.3 ± 2.5%; 4.7 ± 1%, respectively). Under low light, the carbohydrate content of N. jeffreyi was marginally higher in low nitrate treatments (17%) compared to standard (14%) and high (12%) nitrate. Juveniles grazed a larger number of diatoms when the protein content of the diatoms was low, possibly compensating for the lower protein levels. In high light, dense N. jeffreyi biofilms produced elevated pH levels which most likely resulted in the mortality of a large number of juvenile H. laevigata. This study indicates that changes in light intensity and nitrate concentration under which the diatom N. jeffreyi were cultured, affected the growth, survival and grazing rates of juvenile H. laevigata. © 2005 MALACOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AUSTRALASIA.",

Cases such as Epinephelus maculatus, described here, show that the numerical estimation of parasite biodiversity in coral reefs could reach more than ten times the number of fish species; consequently, the extinction of certain fish species from endangered coral reefs would result in the co-extinction of at least ten times the number of parasite species. E. maculatus is a grouper of intermediate size (1-2 kg) and common in the coral reefs of New Caledonia, South Pacific. Based on the examination of more than 800 monogenean specimens, 12 species of monogeneans (ten diplectanids and two ancyrocephalids) were differentiated on the gills. These species of diplectanids have not been found in other epinephelines in the same area and thus are considered as specific to this host. In addition, three species of copepods, and isopod larvae, are present on the gills; E. maculatus thus has a total of 16 species of gill ectoparasites, which can be found together on a single individual fish. Diplectanids include Laticola dae Journo & Justine, 2006, which is the most abundant species representing about 50% of the specimens, and nine species which are rare, each representing 2-7% of the specimens: Diplectanum uitoe n. sp. and eight species of Pseudorhabdosynochus Yamaguti, 1958. D. uitoe, provisionally attributed to Diplectanum Diesing, 1858, is characterised by a small conical penis with internal walls. Pseudorhabdosynochus auitoe n. sp., P. buitoe n. sp., P. cuitoe n. sp., P. duitoe n. sp., P. euitoe n. sp. and P. fuitoe n. sp. are differentiated on the basis of the morphology of the sclerotised vagina, but are very similar in other characteristics; P. guitoe n. sp. is characterised by a quadriloculate organ with very thick walls and a very small sclerotised vagina; and P. huitoe n. sp. is characterised by its sclerotised vagina and by very long ventral and dorsal haptoral bars. Two rare (2-3% of specimens) ancyrocephalids, Haliotrema epinepheli Young, 1969 and Haliotrema sp., are briefly described in relation to the male copulatory organs and haptoral bars; H. epinepheli is apparently a generalist species found in various epinephelines and other fish species.

Shell area preferences of the sabellid were also investigated. Abalone diet (fresh kelp, Ecklonia maxima or Abfeed™) did not affect sabellid settlement success (F1,30 = 1.05; p <= 0.31). There were significant differences in settlement between shell regions, with the highest number of sabellids settling near the respiratory pores (F2,30 = 61.0; p < 0.001). Percentage occupation rate of tubes 96h after settlement did not differ between dietary treatments. There were no significant interactions between diet and shell region for sabellid settlement (F2,30 = 0.77, p = 0.69) and tube formation (F2,30 = 1.02, p = 0.67) or for the percentage occupation rate of the tubes (F9,180 = 0.11, p = 0.73). Thus, infestation intensity in relation to shell region can be estimated independent of abalone diet. For treatment purposes, total settlement after 36 days of exposure can be used to identify the shell areas on which most sabellids will be found.

Agardh) Greville (Gigartinales, Rhodophyta) in controlled environments",2008,Aquaculture International,16,4,283,295,,"Increased market demand for algal raw materials has stimulated research and development into new cultivation technologies, particularly in countries with economically important seaweed industries. Chondrus canaliculatus is a red alga endemic to the temperate Pacific coast of South America and produces a complex carrageenan. In Chile, this potential marine resource has been underutilized since the early 1990s, after it was replaced mainly by imports of Kappaphycus and Eucheum from Asia. The study of the cultivation of C. canaliculatus in outdoor tanks demonstrates the potential to produce large quantities of algal material due to the high productivity observed. The material produced may be important in Chile as feed for cultured algal herbivores such as Haliotis spp. Data were obtained on the key factors affecting the growth of this alga, including light, temperature, and nutrient concentrations. The results showed that, on a dry weight basis, productivity varied seasonally between 40 g m-3 wk-1 in autumn and 200 g m-3 wk-1 in spring, and the optimal stocking density in our experiments was 8 kg m-3. Effects of self-shading were among the most important limiting factors in the culture. Discussion is presented on the interactions between temperature, pH, salinity, enrichment with N and P, and water exchange on the maximal growth of C. canaliculatus in this culture. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.",10.1007/s10499-007-9142-x
Fu J.; Zhang W.; Mai K.; Feng X.; Xu W.; Liufu Z.,Effect of dietary vitamin D on growth and antioxidant responses of abalone Haliotis discus hannai Ino,2006,Gaojishu Tongxin/Chinese High Technology Letters,16,12,1306,1311,,"A 240d growth experiment was conducted in a re-circulated water system to investigate the effects of dietary vitamin D on antioxidant responses of abalone Haliotis discus hannai Ino. Triplicate groups of juvenile abalone (initial weight: 0.81 ± 0.00 g; shell length: 16.42 ± 0.03 mm) were fed to satiation one of 3 semi-purified diets containing 0 IU/kg (deficiency), 5 × 103 IU/kg (normal), 5 × 105 IU vitamin D/kg diet (excess), respectively. Results showed that compared with the normal group, vitamin D deficiency had no significant effect on the weight gain rate (WGR) and daily increment in shell length (DISL) (P < 0.05); excessive vitamin D (5 × 1058 IU/kg) significantly decreased the WGR and DISL of abalone (P < 0.05). The sensitivity of antioxidant enzymes in different tissues (viscera and muscle) of abalone was different to vitamin D deficiency or excess. Compared with the normal group, the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were significantly decreased (P < 0.05), the ratio of GR (glutathione reductase)/GPX was significantly increased (P < 0.05), while the activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), GR and the ratio of CAT/SOD were not significantly affected in the viscera of abalone by vitamin D deficiency (P > 0.05). However, the activities of CAT and SOD were significantly decreased (P < 0.05), and GPX and GR was significantly increased (P < 0.05), by vitamin D-excessive in the viscera of abalone (P > 0.05). In muscle, vitamin D-deficiency had no significantly effects on the activities of CAT, SOD, GST and the ratio of CAT/SOD (P > 0.05), but significantly decreased the activities of GPX and GR and significantly elevated the ratio of GR/GPX (P < 0.05); vitamin D-excessive had no significantly effects on the activities of CAT, GPX, GST and the ratio of CAT/SOD and GR/GPX (P > 0.05), however, the activities of SOD and GR were significantly increased by vitamin D-excessive (P < 0.05).",
Macey B.M.; Coyne V.E.,Improved growth rate and disease resistance in farmed Haliotis midae through probiotic treatment,2005,Aquaculture,245,1-Apr,249,261,,"The use of probiotics in aquaculture is proving to be highly effective in improving disease resistance, nutrition and/or growth of cultured organisms. We have shown that Haliotis midae fed a probiotic-supplemented diet have an improved survival and growth rate compared to animals not fed probiotics. The growth rate of small (20 mm) and large (67mm) abalone was improved by 8% and 34%, respectively, in two separate eight-month farm growth trials. Furthermore, the number, and phagocytic activity, of circulating haemocytes was significantly higher (P<0.05) in probiotic treated animals compared to non-treated animals following challenge with the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio anguillarum. Seven days after challenging with V. anguillarum, the probiotic-fed animals had 62% survival compared to 25% survival for non-treated animals. In situ protease assays showed that probiotic treatment significantly increased (P<0.05) protease activity in the intestinal region of the digestive tract of animals fed the probiotic-supplemented feed. This correlated with a significant increase (P<0.05) in the amount of protein digestion and absorption measured in this region of the abalone gut. Histological analysis showed that the digestive glands of animals receiving probiotics were bacteria-free, whereas the digestive glands of 70% of the animals receiving the non-supplemented feed had a high bacterial load. The microorganisms tested in this study therefore have tremendous potential as probiotics for commercially produced H. midae. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Dunn E.F.; Moy V.N.; Angerer L.M.; Angerer R.C.; Morris R.L.; Peterson K.J.,Molecular paleoecology: Using gene regulatory analysis to address the origins of complex life cycles in the late Precambrian,2007,Evolution and Development,9,1,10,24,,"Molecular paleoecology is the application of molecular data to test hypotheses made by paleoecological scenarios. Here, we use gene regulatory analysis to test between two competing paleoecological scenarios put forth to explain the evolution of complex life cycles. The first posits that early bilaterians were holobenthic, and the evolution of macrophagous grazing drove the exploitation of the pelagos by metazoan eggs and embryos, and eventually larvae. The alternative hypothesis predicts that early bilaterians were holopelagic, and new adult stages were added on when these holopelagic forms began to feed on the benthos. The former hypothesis predicts that the larvae of protostomes and deuterostomes are not homologous, with the implication that larval-specific structures, including the apical organ, are the products of convergent evolution, whereas the latter hypothesis predicts homology of larvae, specifically homology of the apical organ. We show that in the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, the transcription factors NK2.1 and HNF6 are necessary for the correct spatial expression profiles of five different cilia genes. All of these genes are expressed exclusively in the apical plate after the mesenchyme-blastula stage in cells that also express NK2.1 and HNF6. In addition, abrogation of SpNK2.1 results in embryos that lack the apical tuft. However, in the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, NK2.1 and HNF6 are not expressed in any cells that also express these same five cilia genes. Nonetheless, like the sea urchin, the gastropod expresses both NK2.1 and FoxA around the stomodeum and foregut, and FoxA around the proctodeum. As we detected no similarity in the development of the apical tuft between the sea urchin and the abalone, these molecular data are consistent with the hypothesis that the evolution of mobile, macrophagous metazoans drove the evolution of complex life cycles multiple times independently in the late Precambrian. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1525-142X.2006.00134.x
Bobaru F.; Silling S.A.; Jiang H.,Peridynamic fracture and damage modelling of membranes and nanofiber networks,2005,"11th International Conference on Fracture 2005, ICF11",2,,976,981,,"The peridynamic method (Silling [1]) used in this paper reformulates the classical continuum mechanics equations by replacing spatial derivatives with an integral of force densities over a region around the material point of interest. This leads to a non-local method that may be thought of as a continuum version of molecular dynamics simulation. Any two material points are connected by a, possibly nonlinear, elastic spring (bond) with a critical stretch parameter. We present examples of dynamic fracture and damage for high-aspect ratio structures such as membranes and nanofiber networks. The membrane example captures dynamic transition from a mode III fracture to mode I. In the deformation of nanofiber networks we obtain cellular patterns of deformation when, in addition to the elastic forces along fibers or at bonded contacts between fibers, van der Waals forces are acting between the fibers. In this way we eliminate the need of modeling individual atom as required by a MD simulation. The force response across the network is similar to the response observed in rupturing of the protein adhesive in biological structure (abalone shells).",
Deng Y.; Liu X.; Zhang G.; Zhao H.,"Genetic parameter estimates for growth traits at early state of Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai Ino",2007,Acta Oceanologica Sinica,26,5,90,95,,"Heritability and genetic and phenotypic correlations were estimated for juvenile growth traits of Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai Ino. The estimates were calculated from shell length and shell width measurements on progeny resulting from 12 half-sib families and 36 full-sib families obtained using artificial fertilization of mating three females to each male. The measurements were taken at 10, 20 and 30 d after fertilization. It was found that heritability estimates based on sire component ranged from 0. 23 to 0. 36 for shell length and 0. 21 to 0. 32 for shell width. Heritability estimates from dam component were larger than those from sire component at three ages, indicating presence of maternal effects, non-additive genetic effects and common environmental effects. Phenotypic correlations were significant at three ages (P < 0. 05), with values of 0. 92, 0. 93 and 0. 92, respectively. Genetic correlations from the paternal half-sib correlation analysis were highly positive at three ages, with values of 0. 50, 0. 78 and 0. 81, respectively. The results suggest that selective breeding is an effective approach to improving growth traits of Pacific abalone stocks.",
Marine R.,"Review of some california fisheries for 2007: Coastal pelagic finfish, market squid, dungeness crab, California spiny lobster, highly migratory species, Ocean Salmon, groundfish, California Halibut,hagfish, Pacific herring and recreational",2008,California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations Reports,49,,15,38,,"In 2007, commercial fisheries landed an estimated 172,125 metric tons (t) of fishes and invertebrates from California ocean waters (fig. 1). This represents an increase of over 13% from the 152,088 t landed in 2006, and a 32% decline from the peak landings of 252,568 t in 2000. The preliminary ex-vessel economic value of commercial landings in 2007 was nearly $120 million, a decrease of 8% from the $130 million in 2006. Pacific sardine was by far the largest volume fishery in the state at nearly 81,000 t, but third in ex-vessel value at $8.2 million.Market squid was second in landings at over 49,000 t, and was the highest valued fishery in the state at $29.1 million. The other top-five volume fisheries included northern anchovy at 10,400 t, red sea urchin at 5,050 t, and Pacific mackerel at 5,018 t. The ex-vessel value of Dungeness crab dropped to second in 2007 at $26.8 million, a decline of 85% from the record annual harvest in 2006. The other top-five valued fisheries include Pacific Chinook salmon at nearly $7.8 million, California spiny lobster at nearly $6.9 million, and red sea urchin at $5.0 million. Dungeness crab landings for 2007 dropped to less than 5,000 t, a 58% decline from the record landings for 2006. Historically, the fishery peaks in a ten-year cycle.Commercial landings for California spiny lobster also declined to 300 t, a 26% decline from 2006. Starting in 2008, recreational lobster fishermen will need to carry and complete a Spiny Lobster Report Card which will be used to track recreational catch and effort. For highly migratory species, commercial and recreational landings of albacore in California increased over 300%, although landings along the entire West Coast were down in 2007. Landings of all other tuna species increased slightly with the exception of skipjack. Landings of swordfish increased 46% over 2006. In 2007, the California Fish and Game Commission (Commission) adopted bag limits for both albacore and bluefin tuna consistent with federal regulations. In 2007, California ocean salmon fisheries were less constrained than in 2006 due to a higher forecasted abundance of Klamath River Fall Chinook (KRFC). Commercial fisheries had 141 more days open than in 2006. Estimated total commercial landings were 113,400 Chinook (686 t),which was the second lowest catch on record; however, this was still a 45% increase in weight compared to 2006 (lowest catch on record).Recreational fisheries had 90 more days open than in 2006. Estimated total recreational landings were 47,600 Chinook. This is the lowest catch on record and a 51% decrease compared to 2006. Estimated effort was 105,700 angler days, a 16% decrease from 2006.The catch per unit effort was 0.5 fish per angler, a 41% decrease from 2006. California's commercial groundfish harvest for 2007 was over 10,000 t, a 13% decrease over 2006 landings. Pacific whiting, Dover sole, and sablefish continued to be the top species landed.The ex-vessel value of groundfish landings for 2007 was $15.9 million, 8% higher than in 2006.The first stock assessment for blue rockfish was completed in 2007. For California halibut, new regulations have closed portions of the traditional halibut trawl grounds and implemented a restricted access program which has resulted in a decrease in landings from a peak of 596 t in 1999 to a low of 174 t in 2007. Pacific hagfish landings in California increased ten-fold from 77 t in 2006 to 773 t in 2007, the result of increased demand in South Korean markets for human consumption. Pacific herring landings in California dropped to the second lowest level in the 35-year history of the fishery, thought to be the result of a decrease in length at age of the fish and increased competition from other herring fisheries world-wide. Over 541,000 recreational anglers caught nearly 2.7 million fish and invertebrates aboard Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessels (CPFVs) in California in 2007, a 10% decline from the 3.0 million landed in 2006. Rockfishes (all species combined), kelp bass, and California scorpionfish, barred sandbass, and California barracuda were the top species landed. In 2007, the Commission undertook 14 rule-making actions that address marine and anadromous species.The Commission adopted changes to albacore, bluefin tuna, salmon, groundfish, sea urchin, abalone, herring, and rock crab regulations and added the recreational Spiny Lobster Report Card. The Commission also established 15 marine protected areas (528 square kilometers, 204 square .Figure Present. miles) in central California from Pigeon Point in San Mateo County south to Point Conception in Santa Barbara County, and approved the establishment of federal marine protected areas adjacent to the previously established Channel Islands marine protected areas under the Marine Life Protection Act. In addition, the Commission was petitioned to increase protections for two anadromous Osmerids: to uplist the delta smelt from threatened to endangered and to list the longfin smelt as endangered.",

This growth should use technologies with economical and environmental sustainability. Feed accounts for about half the cost in current high-volume fed mono-species aquaculture, mainly fish net pens or shrimp/fish ponds, yet most of this feed becomes waste. The resulting environmental impact and rising feed costs therefore hamper further growth of such farms. As in certain traditional polyculture schemes, plants can drastically reduce feed use and environmental impact of industrialized mariculture and at the same time add to its income. These nutrient-assimilating photoautotrophic plants use solar energy to turn nutrient-rich effluents into profitable resources. Plants counteract the environmental effects of the heterotrophic fed fish and shrimp and restore water quality. Today's integrated intensive aquaculture approaches, developed from traditional extensive polyculture, integrate the culture of fish or shrimp with vegetables, microalgae, shellfish and/or seaweeds. Integrated mariculture can take place in coastal waters or in ponds and can be highly intensified. Today's technologies are well studied and documented. They are generic, modular and adaptable for several culture combinations of fish, shrimp, shellfish, abalone, sea urchin and several species of commercially important seaweeds and vegetables. A 1-ha land-based integrated seabream-shellfish-seaweed farm can produce 25 tons of fish, 50 tons of bivalves and 30 tons fresh weight of seaweeds annually. Another farm model can produce in 1 ha 55 tons of seabream or 92 tons of salmon, with 385 or 500 fresh weight of seaweed, respectively, without pollution. Preliminary calculations show a potential for high profitability with large integrated farms. Several freshwater integrated fish-vegetable farms and a couple of modern fish-algae-shellfish/abalone integrated mariculture farms exist today, and several additional farms are planned. Three major international R&D projects promise to soon expand the horizons of the technology further. Therefore, modern integrated systems in general, and seaweed-based systems in particular, are bound to play a major role in the sustainable expansion of world aquaculture. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, the aim of the present work is to study the possibility of replacing kelp meal in the abalone diet with a regional winery by-product. Five diets were formulated in which kelp meal was substituted from 0% to 100%, at a maximum of 33% of the total of ingredients; 375 abalone (15.09 ± 0.38 mm and 0.434 ± 0.03 g) were used, randomly distributed in fifteen 8-L plastic buckets. After 60 days of experimentation, significant differences were detected in the slopes of the different treatments for both length and weight. Since the inclusion of the winery by-product resulted in a lower feed ingestion but the feed conversion efficiency remained constant, a factor of low palatability can be attributed to the winery by-product and not an antinutritional factor. It is concluded that the winery by-product can be substituted for kelp meal in 16% of the total diet without having a negative effect on the growth of the organisms.",10.7773/cm.v30i12.105

The preliminary exvessel economic value of California commercial landings in 2001 was $104 million, a decrease of 22% from $133 million in 2000. Two of the top three grossing fisheries in the state were invertebrate fisheries, as was the case in 2000. The top three fisheries for 2001 (excluding kelp) in ex-vessel value were market squid ($17.5 million), groundfish ($16 million), and red sea urchin ($11.5 million). These fisheries all decreased in value in 2001 compared with 2000: squid declined 35%, groundfish declined 20%, and sea urchin declined 11.5%, continuing its downward trend since its historic high in 1988. The Dungeness crab fishery, with landings significantly lower than the ten-year mean, fell from the list of the top three fisheries and was valued at $8.9 million in 2000. The swordfish fishery, worth $8.6 million in 2001, was the fifth most valuable fishery in the state, recovering slightly from the low in 1998. Ridgeback prawn decreased 76% in 2001 from its 20-year high in 2000, and spot prawn continued its downward trend from the high set in 1998. White abalone was listed as endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) in May 2001, making it the first marine invertebrate to be listed. A recovery plan is currently being drafted. Revenue generated from kelp harvesting in 2001 was worth an estimated $19 million, after production, to the major harvester and producer of algin products, ISP Alginates; revenue was down from the $40 million reported in 2000 due to the weakening in the U.S. economy in 2001, intense competition from foreign algin producers, and ISP's decision to shift production to its facility in Scotland. Management authority over coastal pelagic species (Pacific sardine, Pacific mackerel, northern anchovy, and jack mackerel) was transferred from state agencies in California, Oregon, and Washington to the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in January 2000. Landings of Pacific sardine remained high in 2001, with an increase in ex-vessel value per metric ton. Only 56% of the sardine harvest guideline was caught in 2001. Pacific mackerel landings fell to 7,000 t in 2001, as did landings in Baja California, Mexico. The fishery was closed in March when the harvest guideline was met. Anchovy landings increased substantially in 2001 to 19,000 t, up 37% from 2000. Landings in the commercial groundfish fishery were less than 12,000 t in 2001, a 67% decrease compared with ten years ago and a 28% decrease compared with last year. The groundfish harvest was again dominated by the Dover sole, thornyhead, sablefish (DTS) complex, which declined substantially compared with 2000. Stock assessments prepared for the DTS complex show a lack of sablefish recruitment over the past decade. Rockfish landings were also down in 2001; 2,401 t were landed in 2001 compared with 3,238 t in 2000, a decline of 26%, and a decline of 83% compared with 1991. As a result of stock assessments in 2000, widow rockfish and darkblotched rockfish were added to the list of groundfishes declared ""overfished""; already on the list are lingcod, bocaccio, Pacific ocean perch, and some rockfishes. The nearshore finfish fishery landed 447 t statewide in 2001, well below the 1997 peak in the fishery of 947 t. The live-fish landings component was 307 t, 69% of the overall nearshore catch. In 2001, the ex-vessel value for live-fish landings was approximately $2.8 million, about 17.5% of the value of the groundfish fishery (nearshore and offshore) and a greater proportion of the fishery's value than in the previous year. 2001 was the second consecutive year PFMC implemented two-month fishery closures for all nearshore rockfishes (winter closure south of Monterey and spring closure north of Monterey; no closure north of Cape Mendocino). During the rockfish closures, fishing effort for the live- fish market shifted to other species in some areas, such as surfperch in the San Francisco area. Recreational finfish landings increased by 5%, to 3,073,793 individual fish caught by 682,019 anglers aboard commercial passenger fishing vessels (CPFVs) in 2001. Southern California CPFV landings comprised 83% of the statewide total, the same as in 2000. Commercial salmon fishers landed more than 1,012 t of chinook salmon, a six-fold decrease from the 20-year high set in 1988. Recreational anglers landed 97,000 chinook salmon from the ocean in 2001, a decline of 48% from the previous year. The coho salmon fishery remained closed. Commercial and recreational landings of white seabass reached an all-time high in 2001: commercial fishers landed more than 120 t, and recreational anglers landed more than 38,000 fish. The Marine Life Management Act provides that fishery management plans (FMPs) shall form the basis for managing California's marine fisheries. A major component of the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) Marine Region's work in 2001 was to draft these plans as well as to amend existing plans, such as the Coastal Pelagic Species FMP (finfishes only), which set a capacity goal for the limited-entry fleet. The California Fish and Game Commission is expected to adopt three more FMPs in 2002 - for nearshore fishes, abalone, and squid. As part of the FMP drafting process, CDFG held numerous workshops to facilitate constituent input into the process. Furthermore, CDFG has partnered with PFMC and others to develop the preliminary FMP for West Coast highly migratory species. In 2001 the California Fish and Game Commission undertook 25 rule-making actions that address marine and anadromous species. In May 2001 the emergency closure of the gill-net fishery in shallow waters (<60 fathoms deep) off the central California coast was upheld, continuing the prohibition established in September 2000 to protect the common murre and the southern sea otter. In addition to the regulatory actions, the commission also received extensive oral and written testimony from the public. In response to comments received regarding Initial Draft Concepts for Marine Protected Areas within California state waters in July 2001, a new process was launched late in the year.",

All strains were within the size range ingested by most filter feeders, i.e. 3-10 μm. Cellular growth rates of aerated 1.6-1 cultures ranged from 0.5-0.7 divisions·day-1 (Papiliocellulus simplex CS-431, Nitzschia cf paleacea CS-433) to 1.7-2.0 divisions·day-1 (Attheya septentrionalis CS-425, Entomoneis cf punctulata CS-426, Extubocellulus spinifera CS-428, Thalassiosira oceanica CS-427). The latter four strains were also rich in energy storage fractions (carbohydrate and/or lipid), especially as cultures progressed to stationary phase. Based on the initial screening, A. septentrionalis, E. cf punctulata, E. spinifera and T. oceanica were assessed as to their food value for juvenile Pacific oysters. The diatoms were fed as part of a mixed diet - each making up 70-83% of the total dry weight - together with an equal mixture of the haptophytes Pavlova lutheri and Isochrysis sp. (T. ISO) over a 21-day experiment. Diets containing A. septentrionalis and E. cf punctulata were the most effective, producing growth rates (k=0.050 day-1) marginally inferior to a similar (reference) diet containing a commonly used aquaculture diatom strain of high nutritional value, T. pseudonana CCMP 1335 (k=0.055 day-1). Regression analysis showed that oyster growth rate was correlated with the content of protein in the equal ration algal diets. We have shown A. septentrionalis and E. cf punctulata to be alternative Australian strains with good nutritional value that could be utilised by oyster hatcheries or nurseries. These strains, and others isolated in the study with different characteristics such as benthic growth or high protein levels, could also prove useful feed species for other animal species grown in aquaculture such as abalone and scallops. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Harasewych M.G.,Pleurotomarioidean gastropods,2002,Advances in Marine Biology,42,,238,287,,"Pleurotomarioidean gastropods are continuously present in the fossil record since the Upper Cambrian and survive into the Recent fauna, thus providing rare insights into the evolutionary history of the class Gastropoda. Pleurotomarioidea achieved greatest numerical and morphological diversity during the Paleozoic, and dominated global shallow water marine gastropod faunas during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic. Only a single family, the Pleurotomariidae, survived the end-Cretaceous Extinction, but was restricted to deep water through most of the Cenozoic. The first living pleurotomariid was discovered during the mid-nineteenth century, along the bathyal zone of the western Atlantic. Subsequently collected specimens of these ""living fossils"" revealed that these animals comprise a mosaic of primitive and highly derived characters that originally inspired a new model of gastropod evolution, but more recently defy the orderly inclusion of this group within a cladistic framework of gastropod phylogeny. Molecular studies have likewise shown that the 18S rDNA gene of pleurotomariids contains novel insertions, and evolves more rapidly than in related taxa. A number of studies confirm that the Pleurotomarioidea may be included in the clade Vetigastropoda together with the Trochoidea, Fissurelloidea, Haliotoidea, and Scissurelloidea. However, neither the position of the super-family within Vetigastropoda, nor the position of Vetigastropoda within Gastropoda is yet robustly resolved. The anatomical and molecular data are reviewed; the latter used to produce a well-resolved phylogeny of the genera within the family, and to justify the naming of the long-used informal grouping ""Perotrochus Group B"" as the genus Bayerotrochus. A review of the geographic and bathymetric distributions of pleurotomariids reveals that the higher taxa segregate bathymetrically, while the species within each genus generally segregate geographically, so that most species exist in allopatry. The diet of pleurotomariids is reviewed, based on direct observations as well as analyses of gut contents, and is shown to consist primarily of sponges, but may include stalked crinoids, octocorals and, under aquarium conditions, fish and clam tissue. Despite their thin and relatively fragile shells, Pleurotomariidae survive an extraordinary number of attacks by predators, primarily crustaceans and fish. Their hypobranchial glands are capable of rapidly secreting a white fluid that probably serves as a chemical defense to repel predators. Circumstantial evidence suggests that this defensive mechanism may have originated during the Paleozoic. Despite the great antiquity of this lineage, pleurotomariids possess a substantial number of morphological, molecular and ecological novelties.",10.1016/s0065-2881(02)42015-9

This study investigated the metabolic rates and use of biochemical reserves in two species of abalone, Haliotis fulgens (the green abalone) and H. sorenseni (the white abalone). Larvae of H. fulgens utilized triacylglycerol as a primary source of endogenous energy reserves for development (∼50% depletion from egg to metamorphic competence). Amounts of phospholipid remained constant, and protein dropped by about 30%. After embryogenesis, larvae of H. fulgens had oxygen consumption rates of 81.7 ± 5.9 (SE) pmol larva-1 h-1 at 15°C through subsequent development. The loss of biochemical reserves fully met the needs of metabolism, as measured by oxygen consumption. Larvae of H. sorenseni were examined during later larval development and were metabolically and biochemically similar to H. fidgens larvae at a comparable stage. Metabolic rates of both species were very similar to previous data for a congener, H. rufescens, suggesting that larval metabolism and energy utilization may be conserved among closely related species that also share similar developmental morphology and feeding modes.",10.2307/1543598

All S. uberis strains produced the enzyme beta-D-glucuronidase, while the S. parauberis strains were negative. The S. uberis and S. parauberis 16S rRNA genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subsequently digested with the restriction enzymes RsaI and AvaII yielding species-specific restriction patterns. Both species were additionally identified by amplifying species-specific parts of the genes encoding the 16S rRNA, the 23S rRNA and the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region, respectively. The CAMP factor gene cfu, a potential virulence factor of S. uberis, was amplified, corresponding to a phenotypically positive CAMP-reaction, using cfu-specific oligonucleotide primers. In addition the streptokinase/plasminogen activator encoding genes skc/pauA, a second potential virulence factor, could be amplified for 126 of the 130 S. uberis but not for S. parauberis. A DNA fingerprinting of S. uberis strains, performed by macrorestriction analysis of their chromosomal DNA by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, revealed that most of the isolates were not related to each other. However, identical DNA patterns were noted for some of the isolates within different quarters of an individual cow and also for different cows within the same farm. The generally unrelated DNA patterns indicated that S. uberis is a pathogen with multiple environmental habitats and that infections are caused by a great variety of strains.",10.4142/jvs.2003.4.3.213

Other important species were Cocconeis speciosa, Gomphonemopsis pseudoexigua, and Climacosphenia moniligera, which was associated to a colonial Navicula sp. None of these species were observed on the other kelp species or on rocky substratum. Even though Cocconeis cf. britannica was very abundant it represents a new record for the Baja California Peninsula coasts. Other first records are C. speciosa. Pseudogomphonema kamtschaticum, Rhoicosphenia adolphi and Okedenia inflexa, albeit this one from sediments and rocky substratum. The absence of Cocconeis cf. britannica from other substrata and other kelp from the area suggests that it may have a preference for M. pyrifera as substrate.

The relationships of oxygen consumption rate with shell length and body weight were all power function. The oxygen consumption between 16 o'clock and 4 o'clock (night time) was higher than 4 o'clock to 16 o'clock (day time), with a peak at 18~20 o'clock. At same temperature, the daily feeding rate of abalone and its body weight showed a relationship of power function. The daily relative feeding rate was increased with temperature. The rates of daily relative feeding and growth were decreased with increasing shell length and body weight. The total conversing efficiency of abalone on kelp (Laminaria japonica) was 53.0% at 14~20°C. The energy contents of abalone flesh, kelp and abalone's dry feces were 19.2, 8.57 and 7.23kJ.g-1, respectively. At 14~20°C, among the assimilation energy by abalone, the feces accounted for 34.6~48.6%, the metabolism by abalone self about 22.0~38.2%, and about 5.6~28.2% was used to accumulation for the flesh of body.",

It seems likely that all three stresses were equally effective at inhibiting mitochondrial ATP formation, which may account for the similarity in flux increase, possibly to maximal rates of AK-mediated ATP formation. Differences in K(for) are related to declines in ATP concentrations, which appear to be stress specific, and likely indicate additional mechanisms of toxicity for NaN3 and PCP.",10.1016/S0742-8413(97)00007-8

Experiments were performed for 5 weeks with two groups of different developmental stage, newly metamorphosed stage (younger post-larvae) and over 1 mm stage (older post-larvae). Both stages of post-larvae reared on CCA + diatoms grew well (53.4 ± 2.4 μm/day; mean ± SE and 85.0 ± 4.0 μm/day; mean ± SE, respectively). Younger post-larvae grew to over 2 mm in 5 weeks, and older ones reached over 4 mm in 5 weeks. There was no difference in shell length of younger post-larvae reared on CCA + diatom and CCA - diatom at the week 1. However, the mean growth rate of abalone on CCA - diatoms from the second to fifth week (24.4 ± 1.9 μm/day; mean ± SE) was significantly lower than that of individuals on CCA + diatoms and the younger post-larvae on CCA - diatoms reached only 1 mm shell length in 5 weeks.

On CCA + diatoms, 74.6 ± 2.0% (mean ± SE) of the younger post-larvae survived for the 5 weeks experiment. In contrast, the survival rate of the younger post-larvae reared on CCA - diatoms decreased rapidly until the second week, and 25.0 ± 12.6% (mean ± SE) of the individuals survived by the fifth week. The results of this study indicate that diatoms are essential for the rapid growth of post-larval abalone on the CCA.

Both stability and pellet toughness were influenced more by the protein source than by the type and concentration of the binder, as diets containing abalone viscera silage lost 20% dry matter, compared to the 10% lost in diets containing fish meal. However, nutrient leaching was not affected by the phycocolloid concentration. This result coincides with previous reports that leaching speed does not depend on stability. In general, all the binders used were effective at low concentrations (0.5%); therefore, the use of phycocolloids at low concentrations is recommended. Attention should also be given to the ingredients used, as these may have a greater influence on stability and toughness than the binders themselves.",10.7773/cm.v27i1.393

The amino acid profile and proximate analyses of muscle meat of the test animal and published nutrient requirements of other species of Haliotids were used as a basis for formulating and developing these practical diets. The diets were fed to abalone at 2-5% body weight once daily (1600 h) for biological evaluation in terms of weight gain (WG), increase in shell length (SL), specific growth rate (SGR), protein efficiency ratio (PER), feed conversion ratio (FCR) and for physical evaluation in terms of shell coloration of the animal. Natural food, Gracilariopsis baitinae (17% CP/2200 kcal ME/kg) (NF) fed ad libitum served as the control. Better growth rates, in terms of WG and SL, FCR and PER were noted in abalone fed the three formulated diets compared with those fed seaweed, G. baitinae. Abalone fed diets 3 (WG: 347%; SGR: 0.81; SL: 140%) and 2 (WG: 307%; SGR: 0.70; SL: 139%) showed significantly better growth rate than those fed diet 1 (WG: 252%; SGR: 0.51; SL: 132%).

Based on PCP toxicity in red abalone (6 h LC50 1.6 mg 1-1; 6 h NOEL = 0.8 mg 1-1), animals were exposed in flowing seawater (14°C) to a sublethal PCP concentration of 1.2 mg 1-1 and a water salinity of either 25, 35 or 45 ‰. Phosphagen changes in foot muscle were monitored by surface-probe localized 31P NMR. Upon PCP exposure, phosphoarginine (PA) levels declined and inorganic phosphate (Pi) levels concurrently increased. Dosing was terminated at a standard metabolic endpoint (MEP). defined as the time for the spectral peak height for Pi to reach one-half that of PA. This was on average 3.3 ± 0.2 and 6.8 ± 0.7 h at ambient salinity; 5.3 ± 0.7 and 7.1 ± 0.7 h for high salinity; and 4.0 ± 0.5 and 6.5 ± 1.0 h at low salinity, for red and black abalone, respectively. During recovery, all biochemical endpoints returned to normal; however, both onset and intensity of effects were influenced by changes in seawater salinity. Disposition of [U-14C]PCP in both species was also examined to determine if the effects observed with NMR had a kinetic basis. Three sets of abalone (n = 3) from each species were exposed to each salinity (25, 35 and 45 ‰), plus 1.2 mg 1-1 of [U-14C]PCP. Red abalone were exposed for 3.5 h and black abalone for both 3.5 and 6.5 h (they represent the lowest average MEP for both species). Residues were quantified via tissue digestion and liquid scintillation counting. The 3.5 h total concentration factors (TCFs) for red abalone were not significantly different among the three salinities (P > 0.05) and ranged from 104 to 133. However, low salinity seemed to deter the uptake of [U-14C]PCP in black abalone, as the TCF was over three times lower for abalone exposed to 25 ‰ at both 3.5 h (TCF = 19 ± 11) and 6.5 h (TCF = 38 ± 8) than at 35 ‰ (3.5 h TCF = 62 ± 6; 6.5 h TCP = 119 ± 11) and 45 % (3.5 h TCF = 67 ± 14, 6.5 h TCP = 115 ± 8). Furthermore, the 3.5 h TCP for red abalone exposed to PCP at all salinities was similar to the 6.5 h TCF for black abalone exposed at 35 and 45 ‰. Thus, black abalone appear to have greater resistance to the combined effects of PCP and salinity variations, which appears to be due to slower uptake of the biocide. While PCP is a potent uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, use of varying water salinities simulated an additional stress imposed on intertidal animals by transient or seasonal environmental changes. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

We measured a mean growth-rate of ca. 30 μm/day, 11 days after larval settlement which stayed constant throughout the experiment. The diatom assemblage on the surface of the alga was studied for 53 days after larval settlement using scanning electron microscopy. Two species of the genus Cocconeis were found to dominate the diatom assemblage on the surface of P. repandum. Up to 18 days after larval settlement, the diatom population increased exponentially. Eighteen days after settlement, post-larval abalone started to graze on the diatom Cocconeis scutellum leaving the bottom valves of the diatoms on the surface of P. repandum. As a result, the diatom population decreased markedly. The outermost cells and polysaccharide layer of P. repandum were often missing but we did not find any grazing marks on the thallus surface up to 53 days post-settlement. We discuss the hypothesis that epithallial cell sloughing of non-geniculate coralline red algae is an intrinsic mechanism to reduce microscopic epiphytes and may interact closely with grazing by post-larval abalone. We concluded that the post-larvae must find an additional food source derived from the NCA before grazing on the diatoms, because of the high growth-rate during the first and second week of rearing and the constancy throughout the experiment.",10.1080/13235818.1997.10673686

A total of 450 samples were examined under 4 different shell lengths, viz. 5, 10, 20, and 30mm. The simulated feed suspensions were either the phytoplankton Pavlova lutheri (average size 3.5 μm) or pulverized pellet powder (average size 3.7 μm), which is used as artificial feed for abalone. The percent catch rate was based on the proportion of particles reduced from the initial number. The particle sizes examined were in the range 2.2 to 45.2 μm. The catch-rates of adult clam (shell length of 30mm) under vigorous filtration indicated nearly constant particle size selection when they were maintained for 60 minutes in the sea water containing 3×105 pellet particles/ml. When the particle concentration increased to 6× 105/ml, however, the catch rates of sizes less than 15 μm decreased to almost a third of the above mentioned concentration. A similar reduction was noted when the exposure was for 180 minutes. Furthermore, the catch rates for particle sizes more than 5 μm increased by almost 20% when pellet was replaced with phytoplankton. When Manila clam of different shell lengths were kept for 60 minutes in the sea water containing 3×105 particles/ml, the catch rates of 5 mm clams for the entire range of particle sizes were almost uniform, showing an average value of 0.68%·h-1. When their shell lengths increased to 10 mm or 20mm, the catch rates for the larger sizes appeared to increase. Thus the larger clams, among the sizes examined, seeks intentionally larger suspended particles to meet their growth requirements.",

Roberts R.D.; Nicholson C.M.,"Variable response from abalone larvae (Haliotis iris, H. virginea) to a range of settlement cues",1997,Molluscan Research,18,2,131,141,,"We exposed competent larvae of two abalone species (Haliotis iris and H. virginea) to a range of potential settlement cues, and observed a hierarchy of responses. The end point and the timing of the settlement process varied, depending on the cue provided. Response was qualitatively consistent between experiments, but showed some quantitative variation. Rocks coated with crustose coralline algae (CCA) induced 80-100% of larvae to attach and metamorphose, and 50-100% to grow peristomal shell, within 2 days. A distilled water extract of CCA induced almost 100% attachment within 2 days, but metamorphosis occurred gradually between 2 and 5 days. Shell growth was minimal, apparently inhibited by chemical interference from the extract. γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA, 1 μM) induced 90-100% attachment and 20-60% metamorphosis in H. iris within 2 days. For H. virginea, 1 μM GABA induced attachment (65-100%) but typically only 0-5% metamorphosis within 2 days. KC1 (10 mM) added to seawater induced attachment (50-70%) but less than 10% metamorphosis. Different diatoms induced responses ranging from rapid or gradual induction of metamorphosis, to minimal response. Some combinations of cues produced synergistic effects. E.g., GABA (1 μM) plus diatom biofilm induced more metamorphosis (49%) than biofilm (28%) or GABA (1%) alone. Addition of CCA crude extract to the same biofilm hastened metamorphosis. Observations of attachment without subsequent metamorphosis suggest that there may be separate cues for attachment and metamorphosis. This study highlights the complexity of the settlement response in abalone.",10.1080/13235818.1997.10673687
Leighton D.L.,"Control of sabellid infestation in green and pink abalones, Haliotis fulgens and H. corrugata, by exposure to elevated water temperatures",1998,Journal of Shellfish Research,17,3,701,705,,"The majority of the abalone hatcheries in California are now plagued by an introduced shell-infesting sabellid polychaete, which in extreme cases, causes extensive shell deformities and greatly retards body growth. In addition to the adverse effect on the abalone aquaculture industry, there is concern that this pest may become established among native stocks. Efforts to exterminate mature and immature stages of the sabellid have focused on the use of water-soluble toxic substances, coating shells with wax or other substances to smother the worms, or altering the osmotic environment without causing irreversible injury to the abalone. These approaches have not provided a dependable method for control of the polychaete. Exposure of sabellid-infested green and pink abalones (Haliotis fulgens and Haliotis corrugata) to temperatures near but below their upper thermal limits has produced the desired results. A 48-h exposure to 28.5°C has effectively killed all life stages of the sabellids but caused only minor mortality among the abalone. An LD50, 48-h upper limit for H. fulgens was confirmed at 31.5°C; that for H. corrugata was established at 30.3°C. Treated abalone placed in optimally circulated seawater and fed the standard food, Egregia menziesii, resumed normal growth and thenceforth displayed no further symptoms of sabellid infestation. The method is fully compatible with life requirements of the green and pink abalones, but would not be suitable for treatment of species (e.g., Haliotis rufescens) known to have upper lethal limits well below 28°C.",
Uki N.; Kikuchi S.,"Regulation of maturation and spawning of an abalone, Haliotis (Gastropoda) by external environmental factors",1984,Aquaculture,39,1-Apr,247,261,,"Gonadal maturation of Haliotis discus hannai is proportional to the effective accumulative temperature (EAT), in accordance with the following formula: Yn= ∑ i=l n(Ti-θ) where Yn = EAT in degree-days, ti = temperature to which the animals are exposed daily (°C), and θ = the biological minimum for gonadal growth, which is 7.6°C in H. discus hannai. The progress of gonadal maturation may be divided into three states: immature (0-500 degree-days), mature (500-1500 degree-days), and fully mature (after 1500 degree-days). This system agrees with qualitative observations of the progress of maturation confirmed by artificial induction of spawning, where EAT 0 is the beginning of conditioning started during the recovery stage of the reproductive cycle of this species in the winter. Temperature appears to be the major external environmental factor which regulates the breeding cycle of this mollusc, because the artificially produced spawning period (after 1500 degree-days) corresponds well with the natural breeding season in terms of EAT. Adequate nutritional levels of over 5% feeding rate (weight wet food ingested/body weight) are necessary for application of this relationship of EAT uniformly to experimental populations. Gravid adults are obtainable throughout the year by temperature control based on EAT. Spawning is induced by a stimulus produced by the UV irradiation of seawater. The release of gametes can be set for any desired time of day by artificial photoperiod (12L-12D) conditioning of the mollusc in advance. © 1984.",10.1016/0044-8486(84)90270-9

III. response of abalone to various levels of dietary lipid",1995,Aquaculture,134,1-Feb,65,80,,"This study was carried out to evaluate the effects of graded dietary lipid levels on the survival, growth and body composition of Haliotis tuberculata and H. discus hannai. Six purified diets were formulated to provide approximately 25% protein, and a series of graded lipid levels, from 0.63 to 11.58%, in the form of a mixture of corn oil and menhaden fish oil (1:1). The red alga, Palmaria palmata, was used as a control diet. Abalone juveniles of similar size (H. tuberculata, 588 mg; H. discus hannai, 389 mg) were distributed in a recirculating system using a completely randomized design with 7 treatments and 3 replicates per treatment (20 juveniles/replicate), and fed the appropriate diet every 3rd day for a 100-day period. P. palmata produced similar or better growth performance for both abalone species than the artificial diets. Among the artificial diets, significantly higher weight gains were observed for H. discus hannai at dietary lipid levels ranging from 3.11 to 7.09%, and for H. tuberculata at 3.11%. However, growth in terms of protein gain was best when both species of abalone were fed 3.11 and 5.15% dietary lipid. Soft-body lipid content positively correlated with dietary lipid levels. Inversely, soft-body protein concentrations decreased with the increase of dietary lipid. Overall, H. discus hannai deposited a slightly higher level of lipid, but a lower level of protein than H. tuberculata. There were no significant differences in survival of abalone fed the experimental diets. © 1995.",10.1016/0044-8486(95)00043-2

Shepherd S.A.,Studies on Southern Australian Abalone (Genus Haliotis). i. Ecology of Five Sympatric Species,1973,Marine and Freshwater Research,24,3,217,258,,"Five species of abalone occur along the southern Australian coastline; of these three species, Haliotis laevigata Donovan, Haliotis roei Gray, and Haliotis ruber Leach, are of commercial importance; the other two species are Haliotis cyclobates Peron and Haliotis scalaris Leach. The habitat, movement, feeding behaviour, food, and ecological relationships with predators were studied for each species at three study sites. Each species of abalone occupies a distinctive microhabitat. H. cyclobates lives in calm-water places associated with communities of the seagrass Posidonia australis and the razor shell Pinna dolobrata; H. laevigata lives on open rock adjacent to sand in moderate to rough water localities; H. ruber prefers caves in calm- to rough-water localities; H. roei occurs in narrow crevices in the upper sublittoral on rough-water coasts; H. scalaris is an under-boulder or crevice-living species. All species are sedentary, but may make local movements in search of food. Several species may occur in a given habitat but there is little microhabitat overlap. The seasonal variation in food eaten by each species is described. All species show preference for red algae and reject most species of brown algae, subsisting predominantly on red algae and seagrasses according to the possibilities of the habitat. H. laevigata feeds mainly on algal drift and H. roei is substantially a grazing species. The other species feed on algal drift or graze opportunistically. Water movement is an important environmental factor affecting the feeding of those species which feed on algal drift. H. laevigata and H. ruber feed best in conditions of moderate water movement but poorly if the water is too calm or too rough. Water movement elicits a characteristic feeding response in these species. The predators of abalone include fish, crabs, molluscs, and starfish; their interaction with abalone is discussed. Crevices, caves, and cavities under boulders provide a refuge in space from predators for H. roei, H. ruber, and H. scalaris and juveniles of other species, which appear to be confined to these places, except for nocturnal feeding excursions, by the activity of their predators. The adults of the different species differ from each other in their dependence on water movement, their preference for open or cryptic sites such as crevices or caves for resting, their size and their methods of feeding. These differences between the species, taken together, ensure that there will be very little overlap between them in the sorts of places that they seek to live in or their behaviour in seeking food; in those cases where food-seeking behaviour is similar, interspecific competition would seem to be negligible because food is abundant. Predation would seem to have been more important than interspecific competition as the selective pressure that established and maintains these differences between the species. © 1973 CSIRO.

Morse D.E.,Biotechnology in marine aquaculture,1986,Aquacultural Engineering,5,2-Apr,347,355,,"Intensification of production, modernization of technique, and improvement of cultivars are needed to increase the economic efficiency of marine aquaculture industries. To help achieve such improvements, modern methods of biochemical and genetic engineering can be adapted to control biological processes which intrinsically limit the efficiency and yield of production. Such applications now have been developed for improved production of molluscs. Critical life-cycle stages of several species of abalones and other commercially valuable molluscs which thus far have proved amenable to improved control by these means include reproduction, larval settlement, metamorphosis, and acceleration of early growth. Analysis of the physiological and molecular mechanisms which control reproduction in molluscs reveals a prostaglandin-dependent regulation of spawning in abalones and certain other species. Spawning of gravid adults can be induced by the addition of prostaglandins to the surrounding seawater, or, more reliably and inexpensively, by activation of the endogenous enzymatic synthesis of prostaglandin-related spawning triggers in response to added hydrogen peroxide. Peroxide activation of the prostaglandin-dependent spawning reaction has been found widely useful for obtaining synchronous and copious release of fully competent gametes in a large number of species of abalones, oysters, scallops, mussels, clams, and other valuable molluscs; a number of these species had not been successfully spawned by other methods. Settlement and metamorphosis of many molluscan species can be brought under similar biochemical control. Most efficiently and inexpensively, the natural biochemical requirement for induction of these critical developmental processes can be met by providing competent larvae with unique amino acid constituents associated with the naturally required inducing molecules. Thus, γ-aminoburyric acid (GABA) can be used simply, safely and inexpensively to induce complete and rapid larval settlement and metamorphosis - with minimal mortality - in many commercially important abalone species. This and similar neurotransmitter-related, amino-acid-derived compounds are proving comparably effective for the reliable induction of settlement and metamorphosis in a number of other valuable molluscan species. Recent analyses of the requirements for rapid early juvenile growth in abalones reveals a mechanism of growth-control which is susceptible to exogenous hormonal acceleration. Genetic cloning and amplification of recombinant-DNA templates for the efficient production of essential growth-regulating hormones, and substances required for enhanced nutritional efficiency and resistance of cultivars, are now in progress. Genetic engineering for the direct improvement of cultivated species soon will be within reach. © 1986.",10.1016/0144-8609(86)90027-0

Heart-rate responses, as a physiological indicator, against water-temperature changes were compared between animals with differential genetic make-ups in thermostability of enzyme to examine the above results suggested from observing wild populations by using a total of 98 specimens of the pacific abalone, sampled from waters of Sanriku, Iwate and Rebun Islands, Hokkaido. After being acclimated to a rearing tank with water temperature regulating system, each animal was subjected to a constant rate of change of water temperatures for recording heart-rate responses until being sacrificed. Heart-rate was recorded as frequency of changes of impedance between two electrodes inserted immediately dorsal to the heart through fine holes in the shell. Temperatures, at which maximum heart-rate (or one half of the maximum) appeared, varied from one animal to another, as demonstrated by distributions of selected parameter (s) of heart-rate curve. In addition, associations between the parameter and genetic make-up of thermostability of enzyme of individual animals were observed, thus supporting the view on possible adaptive value of temperature tolerance, suggested from observations on wild populations noted above. © 1984, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

The abalone were fed sea lettuce (Ulva lactuca) used in the polyculture system to remove nutrients regenerated by the bivalves. This polyculture system was operated on a moderate-sized scale during the summer of 1973. Growth and feeding rates of the abalone were measured during a 112-day period and net growth efficiency was calculated (net production/food ingested). All three species grew during the experiment but H. rufescens had the lowest efficiency of 10.2%, and H. fulgens had the highest efficiency of 22.7%. These differences might be due to the temperature regime (16-23°C) during the experiment. H. rufescens is typically found in colder waters whereas H. fulgens is common in warmer Southern California waters.

Effects of algal diets on growth and biochemical composition",1993,Invertebrate Reproduction and Development,23,2-Mar,75,88,,"This study was conducted to examine the nutritional value of eight algal diets for two species of abalone, Haliotis tuberculata and Haliotis discus hannai, by measuring biochemical composition of the algae and relating this to feeding rate, growth and biochemical composition of the animals. Nutritional value of algal diets can be divided into three categories for each species of abalone. For H. tuberculata the best performance was on the mixed diet and Palmaria palmata intermediate was Alaria esculenta, Ulva lactuca and Laminaria digitata, and lowest growth was on Laminaria saccharina and Chondrus crispus. For H. discus hannai, best performance was on A. esculenta, P. palmata and the mixed diet; intermediate was on L. saccharina and L. digitata and lowest was on U. lactuca. It is generally accepted that high “balanced” levels of protein (> 15%), lipid (3-5%) and carbohydrate (20-30%), with no detrimental substances in natural algae are essential for optimal growth performance of these abalone. The fact that A. esculenta, L. saccharina and U. lactuca had different dietary values for the two abalone species indicates specific nutritive requirements and/or digestive physiology. Overall, H. tuberculata grew faster, had higher food conversion efficiencies and muscle yield than H. discus hannai. Generally abalone fed on the highest category diets, had higher muscle yields and levels of protein, visceral lipids and muscle carbohydrate. Viscera and foot muscle are reservoirs for lipid and carbohydrate, respectively. The effect of algal diet on sexual maturation is similar to that on somatic growth. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",10.1080/07924259.1993.9672298

Mutuality Among the Colored Shell Area, Growth of the Abalone and Algal Vegetation",1962,NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI,28,8,780,783,,"In the abalone, Haliotis discus hanntai Ino, growing ground Onagawa Bay, Miyagi Prefecture, a proportion of the bluish-green area to the whole shell surface may be assumed as an index to the relative growth of the univalve. In this respect the author (1962) experimentally proved that the abalones fed with brown algae grow faster than those given green or red algae, and their shell bears bluish-green color. He (1958) also reported that correlation exists between annual harvests of the abalones and their favorite food, Undaria pinnatifida, a brown seaweed. The present work was undertaken to evaluate various localities around the Bay for propagation of the abalone by observing the ratio of the bluish-green area to the whole shell surface of the sample specimens and algal vegetation in these areas (Table 1 and Fig. 1). The survey indicated that 1) the annual harvest of U. pinnatifida per kilometer of the coast line was different from place to place (Fig. 1); 2) where the brown alga was more abundant, the abalone grew faster with the bluish-green shell area being larger, than in specimens from the other localities (Fig. 2); 3) even among the specimens from the same seaweed ground, those which had a higher ratio of the bluish-green area grew faster than the others (Fig. 3). These findings suggest that in a locality where U. pinnatifida is flourish, the abalone ottener eats this seaweed, grows faster, and comes to bear the bluish-green shell area at a higher ratio. In other words, the shell complexion of the abalone from a locality may reveal, to some extent, whether or not the locality is suitable for propagation of the univalve. © 1962, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

In the present studies, the digestibilities of several proteins and carbohydrates in Japanese top shell, Turbo cornutus, a seaweed feeder, have been determined by the chromic oxide indicator method.3) The composition of the synthetic diets used was shown in Table 1. The method of preparing diets was the same that applied in Haliotis (this bull., 29, 691 (1963)), namely, sodium alginate in the diets was converted to insoluble calcium alginate by dipping in CaCl2 solution and the nutrients were kept in it. The shells were provided with the film-shaped diets thus prepared. The chemical composition of the diets showed little change in sea water for several hours (Table 2). As shown in Table 3, casein was found to be the highest in digestibility among proteins tested, and followed by soybean meal- and dried brown alga-proteins. The digestibilities of fish meal-proteins were low, especially in brown fish meal. The polysaccharides such as dextrin and alginic acid were considerably high in digestibility regardless the composition of the diet and laminarin showed also high value, whereas that of raw starch was low.

A similar study was made of faecal matter obtained from captive animals that were fed on solo diets of common drift algae. Results indicated a number of brown, red and green macroalgae could pass through the digestive tract of both species with some degree of cellular integrity and pigmentation (although not necessarily alive). Despite this variety, none of the fragments collected from the faecal matter of wild taken abalone grew in culture. A large number of fine filamentous and microalgae, presumably derived from the epiphytic communities on the macroalgae consumed by the abalone, were found to grow in culture having survived digestion. Cultures from faecal matter of abalone fed on solo diets showed two species, Caulerpa brownii (C. Agardh) Endlicher and Ulva australis Areschoug, were capable of surviving digestion; both algae are less preferred by abalone than other food species. Highly preferred algae are digested too efficiently to survive and the less preferred algae are either not consumed or otherwise eaten in such small quantities that survival cannot be determined. © 1995 by Walter de Gruyter.",10.1515/botm.1995.38.1-6.53

This transition is accompanied by a switch in genetic expression of the template proteins, suggesting that the premetamorphic protein may serve as a template for aragonite nucleation and growth, while template proteins synthesized after metamorphosis may direct crystallization of calcite. These analyses are based on improvements we recently reported for the detection and purification of proteins from the demineralized shell matrix. Genetic cloning experiments now in progress are aimed at discovering additional protein sequences responsible for the programmed control of crystal phase termination, since it is the termination and reinitiation of mineralization that is responsible for the regularity of highly ordered microlaminates produced in nature.",

The two lower-molecular-weight fractions (<1000, 1000-10,000) were the least stimulatory of the three fractions tested, and both were ineffective as feeding stimulants. Solutions combining any two of the three isolated fractions produced behavioral activity equal to that caused by whole extract; thus, no single fraction was essential to the stimulatory capacity of abalone. The >1000-dalton fraction was also highly stimulatory, meaning that large and not small molecules were essential in initiating feeding. Finally, a 75% ethanol-insoluble component of the <10,000 fraction was effective, while the ethanol-soluble portion was not. Since the insoluble material consisted predominantly of peptides and polypeptides, it is probable that these molecules act as principal stimulants in abalone muscle. © 1984 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",10.1007/BF00987976

Dietary value of the casein diet was found to be comparable or superior to that of the alga. While feeding abalone on a white fishmeal diets resulted in a lower growth and FCE, being about 60% of those compared to the casein diets.

The experiment was conducted on triplicate groups, each consisting of 20 abalone. The duration of the study was 90 days. Diets were offered as dry pellets of 2 cm2. The growth pattern was very similar for both treatments fed artificial diets (FM and CM), and the highest growth rate was during the first weeks, decreasing gradually thereafter. The abalone fed with FM showed the highest growth rate, being 101 μm per day. The rate at the end of the experiment was 13.5 μm per day. For the CM the daily growth rate decreased from 98 to 17 μm per day. With MA, the growth rate decreased from 25 to 17 μm per day. The decrease in growth rate may be due to several factors. © 1993.",10.1016/0044-8486(93)90131-H
Viana M.T.; Cervantes-Trujano M.; Solana-Sansores R.,Attraction and palatability activities in juvenile abalone (Haliotis fulgens): nine ingredients used in artificial diets,1994,Aquaculture,127,1,19,28,,"Nine different ingredients (fish acid silage, neutralized fish acid silage, neutralized abalone viscera silage, fish meal, corn meal, fresh and dried Macrocystis pyrifera, gelatin and soybean meal) were used to evaluate the attraction and palatability activity on juvenile of abalone (Haliotis fulgens). Groups of 45 organisms were randomly separated from a batch of 170 and distributed in three aquaria. Twelve-hour observations were performed using a conduct sheet with assigned values. In the first 4 h the attraction activity was evaluated, and at the 12th hour, the palatability was registered. With the data obtained, a statistical analysis was performed, using a χ2-test from the observed frequencies. From the 9 ingredients evaluated, three silages gave a significant change in conduct. The pH was found to be an important factor for attraction and palatability and a logistic model was used to evaluate a possible pH effect on the attraction activity. The silage made from abalone viscera generated a high attraction and palatability activity. © 1994.",10.1016/0044-8486(94)90188-0

Evaluation of chemotaxis activity, with special reference to repellence of food for black abalone Haliotis discus",1992,Marine Biology,112,3,383,388,,"The present study on chemotaxis activity was conducted between May 1989 and March 1990. In order to establish a chemotaxis index, with special reference to a repellence index of food for black abalone Haliotis discus, a logistic curve y=g/{1+ exp [-r(j-a)]}, where g, r and a are constants, was applied to time-courses of abalone responses to fresh and spoiled algal extracts. The time-courses were respresented by the number of individuals (yi) displaying three behaviors (entering. leaving and remaining in a test compartment with algal sample) over time (j=1 to 10, 2-min intervals). Repellence and attraction specimens were prepared from a homogenate of green laver Ulva pertusa allowed to spoil for 2, 4 and 6 d at 40°C, and from fresh homogenate, respectively. Of 32 time-courses (estimated according to a method whereby the observed number was weighted by j for each behavior, involving 30 individuals), 32 ""entered"", 19 ""left"" and 19 ""remained"" time-courses fitted the curve at the 0.10 level, as determined by a chi-square test. A general evaluation of repellence and attraction, determined by observable behavior, agreed well with the difference in a between the dummy (control) and specimen curves, and with the ratio of a in the dummy curve to a in the specimen curve, for logistic curves fitted to the ""entred"" time-course. The difference was >0 and the ratio was >1 in the repellence index, and <0 or <1 respectively in the attraction index. The validity of the indexes was ascertained using food specimens prepared from three kinds of algae. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/BF00356283
Barlow L.A.; Truman J.W.,"Patterns of serotonin and SCP immunoreactivity during metamorphosis of the nervous system of the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens",1992,Journal of Neurobiology,23,7,829,844,,"Larvae of the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, rely on external chemical cues to trigger metamorphosis; thus, the timing of metamorphosis is depedent upon the larva's chance encounter with the appropriate substrate. We examined the effect of the timing of metamorphosis on the development of the central nervous system (CNS), concentrating on the pattern of serotonin and small cardioactive peptide‐ (SCP) immunopositive neurons in the cerebral ganglia. By 4 days postfertilization the cerebral ganglion has five pairs of serotonin‐immunoreactive (IR) neurons, one pair of which (the V cells) innervate the velum. This complement of cells remains stable for as long as the larval stage persists but metamorphosis causes the rapid loss of the V cells. In the case of SCP‐IR neurons, one pair is present prior to metamorphic competency, but as larvae continue to age in the absence of inducing cues, additional pairs are gradually added. Metamorphosis causes an acceleration in SCP‐IR neuron addition. This separation of developmental patterns is well adapted for the inherent uncertainty of the timing of metamorphosis in abalone larvae. © 1992 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Fujino K.; Okumura S.-I.; Inayoshi H.,Temperature Tolerance Differences among Normal Diploid and Triploid Pacific Abalones,1987,NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI,53,1,15,21,,"Successful induction of two kinds of triploid abalone animals (abbreviated as 3n.lpb and 3n.2pb respectively), by inhibiting release of first or second polar body, was reported recently. The present work examines associations between thermostability variations of enzymes at multiple loci and temperature tolerance in terms of survival of animals against high and/or low temperature stresses within each group of diploid and triploid animals, induced artificially, and compared such temperature tolerances between normal diploid (2n) and two kinds of triploid sib animals of the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai. Significantly higher survivals of animals homozygous of thermo-resistant allele at phosphoglucomutase and malate dehydrogenase thermostability loci against high water temperature stress as well as of those homozygous of thermo-sensitive allele at malate dehydrogenase thermostability locus against low water temperature stress were observed. Comparison of high temperature tolerances between different ploidy sib animals indicated the greatest survival in the animals of 3n.lpb group, followed by 2n and the least survival in 3n.2pb group. In addition, a combined effect of chromosome-set manipulation and selected genotype of thermostability variations was seen, suggesting a possible immediate application of the results of such observations towards greater productivity in abalone aquaculture through an appropriate selective breeding programme. © 1987, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

Uki N.; Kemuyama A.; Watanabe T.,Optimum Protein Level in Diets for Abalone,1986,NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI,52,6,1005,1012,,"A feeding experiment was carried out by feeding juvenile abalone Haliotis discus hannai with diets containing casein or white fishmeal as a protein source at different protein levels (0-55%) for 50 days at a water temperature of 20°C in order to determine an optimum protein level in the diet for the abalone. In the abalone receiving the casein diets, feed conversion efficiency (FCE) and protein retention were found to be proportional to the dietary protein levels and reached plateau at a 38% protein level where the values for PER and NPU were 2.4 and 48, respectively. The maximum rate of protein retention was obtained at a 10% protein level in the casein diet and at a 22% protein level in the white fishmeal diet. In addition, growth, FCE and protein retention in the abalone fed on the white fishmeal diets were all far inferior to those obtained by the casein diets. The values for PER and NPU obtained with the white fishmeal diets were about one half of those obtained with the casein diets. The difference in nutritional quality between both of these protein sources was postulated to be due to low digestibility of white fishmeal protein in the abalone. When casein is used as a protein source, an optimum protein level in the practical diets for juvenile abalone is estimated to be around 20-30% based on the growth rate, FCE, protein retention and NPU. © 1986, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

Barkai R.; Griffiths C.L.,An energy budget for the South African abalone Haliotis midae Linnaeus,1988,Journal of Molluscan Studies,54,1,43,51,,"Existing data on feeding, growth rate, fecundity, absorption efficiency, respiration and excretion rates in the South African abalone Haliotis midae Linnaeus are converted to energy equivalents and utilised to compile individual energy budgets. About 63% of the energy content of the food consumed (C) is lost as faeces (F) and a further 32% expended on respiration (R). Energy losses in the form of ammonia excretion are negligible, accounting for less than 1% of consumption. Some 5% of energy intake, or 13% of absorbed ration (Ab) is thus available for growth and reproductive output (Pg & Pr). In juveniles (<100mm) this is all allocated towards somatic growth, while in adults an increasing proportion of production is expended on reproductive output. Although feeding, respiration and excretion rates all increase with temperature the proportions of energy allocated to the various components of the energy budget appear to be consistent. Population energy budgets are calculated from density and size distribution surveys at two study sites. At Marcus Island, on the Cape west coast, the population has a standing stock of 82 g (wet flesh weight) m-2,.consumes about 3260 KJm-2y-1 algae and has a P/B ratio of 0.46, whereas at Cape Hangklip, on the Cape south coast, the population biomass is_133gm-2, consumes 8613KJm-2y-1 and has a P/B ratio of 0.70.

Further classification of the algae into four grades from superior to null based on molluscan weight gain was attempted. Twelve species of algae were shown to be of superior value (21 % of all surveyed) including Order Laminariales, Desmarestia spp., Chondria and Enteromorpha. Nineteen species of algae were ranked as having no value (33% of all).

The role of polyunsaturated fatty acids of macroalgae in abalone nutrition",1996,Aquaculture,139,1-Feb,77,89,,"This study was undertaken to evaluate the nutritional role of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in dietary macroalgae for the abalone, Haliotis tuberculata and Haliotis discus hannai. The effects of five species of macroalgae (Alaria esculenta, Laminaria digitata, Laminaria saccharina, Palmaria palmata and Ulva lactuca) on specific growth rates (SGR) of the abalone and, the relationship between abalone SGR and fatty acid profiles in the algae were investigated. The current study confirmed our previous findings. Based on SGR the dietary values of these macroalgae can be listed in a decreasing order as follows: P. palmata, A. esculenta, U. lactuca, L. digitata and L. saccharina for H. tuberculata and, A. esculenta, P. palmata, L. digitata, L. saccharina and U. lactuca for H. discus hannai. Fatty acid analysis revealed that C18 and C20 PUFA, such as 18:4n-3, 18:3n-3, 20:4n-6 and 20:5n-3, were dominant in the brown algae, A. esculenta, L. digitata and L. saccharina. The red alga, P. palmata, was characterised by the highest proportion of 20:5n-3 among the selected algae. In the green alga, U. lactuca, however, the dominant PUFA were C16 and C18 fatty acids, while C20 fatty acids were minimal. All the selected algae consistently contained very low levels of C22 fatty acids. Statistical analyses demonstrated that (a) 20:5n-3 played a prominent role in the nutrition of both abalone species; (b) 18:3n-3 as well as other n-3 PUFA, and 18:2n-6 together with other n-3,6 long-chained PUFA also contributed to the faster growth of H. tuberculata and H. discus hannai, respectively. The results suggest that the PUFA of both n-3 and n-6 families seem to be essential for growth of H. discus hannai; for H. tuberculata, however, growth enhancement appeared to depend largely on n-3 PUFA. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

Uki N.; Watanabe T.,Effect of Heat-treatment of Dietary Protein Sources on Their Protein Quality for Abalone,1986,NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI,52,7,1199,1204,,"Effect of heat-treatment of dietary proteins on their nutritional quality for the abalone Haliotis discus hannai was investigated to clarify the reason for low dietary value of white fishmeal as a protein source in abalone diet. Casein and fishmeal prepared from pollock were exposed to various heat-treatments (80-130° C, 2 h) and their nutritional quality as protein sources was compared with those without treatment or fresh fish meat by feeding abalone of different growth stages (13–56 mm in shell length) with diets containing each of those protein sources. The nutritional quality of dietary protein sources was found to be greatly affected by heat-treatment. The growth of abalone and feed conversion efficiency were remarkably reduced by feeding diets containing heat-treated casein or fishmeal. The influence of heat-treatment on the dietary value of protein sources was more marked in larger size of abalone. Thus it may be concluded that the inferior protein quality of white fishmeal to casein in abalone is due to the effect of heat during the manufacturing process of white fishmeal. © 1986, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

This parasite showed high resistance to six other potential disinfectants: formalin, iodophor, isopropanol, methylene blue, malachite green, and copper sulfate. The antibiotic fungicide cycloheximide at 1-2 mg per l for 23 h per day on 5 consecutive days proved efficacious. However, this treatment had three disadvantages: (1) it was detrimental to some diatoms upon which the abalone fed, (2) it was ineffective against non-growing but infective zoospores of L. haliotidis and thus reinfection usually occurred within 2-3 weeks following treatment, and (3) it resulted in cycloheximide resistant forms of L. haliotidis. Two different combinations of three sulfonamides (sodium sulfamethazine and sodium sulfathiazole with either sodium sulfapyridine or sodium sulfacetamide), especially in conjunction with neomycin sulfate, partially retarded the progression of the disease. Nine other therapeutic agents (betanaphthol, acriflavin hydrochloride, rivanol, furanace, oxytetracycline, chloramine-B, oxolinic acid, metronidazole, and neomycin sulfate) showed little or no activity against L. haliotidis at concentrations higher than would be feasible for use in an abalone culture facility. © 1989.",10.1016/0044-8486(89)90098-7

The amino acid compositions of 6 species of macroalgae (Ulva lactuca, Chondrus crispus, Palmaria palmata, Alaria esculenta, Laminaria digitata and Laminaria saccharina) and of the whole soft body of these abalone were determined and compared. The effects of these algal diets on the free amino acid (FAA) profiles in the viscera and muscle of animals were investigated. To find a suitable index to evaluate the protein quality of natural diets for algivores, several indices were computed and correlated to the growth performance of abalone using correlation analysis. These two species of abalone have a very similar amino acid composition, indicating that they may have similar amino acid requirements. In all the selected algae, arginine may be the limiting amino acid, and in some instances methionine, threonine or histidine may be also limiting. Judging from the results of feeding test and amino acid analysis, P. palmata and A. esculenta seem to have the better amino acid pattern and availability among the selected algae. On the other hand, U. lactuca and C. crispus appear to be poor in their amino acid availability and/or pattern. Dietary treatments significantly affected the FAA profiles in animal tissues. The essential amino acid index (EAAI) and the degree of similarity (DS) of EAA patterns may not be applicable to evaluating the nutritional value of protein in natural feeds for the algivorous molluscs. Among the indices examined, the newly proposed index-balance and adequacy of free EAA in viscera (BAEAAv)-seems to be suitable for estimation of protein quality of natural feeds for abalone, because it takes into account the balance, adequacy and availability of EAA in natural diets. © 1994.",10.1016/0044-8486(94)90107-4
Spaulding D.C.; Morse D.E.,Purification and characterization of sulfatases from Haliotis rufescens: evidence for changes in synthesis and heterogeneity during development,1991,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,161,5,498,515,,"The digestive glands of many marine molluscs are rich sources of arylsufatase enzymes which may function in the catabolism of sulfated polysaccharides in the diets of herbivorous species. Arylsulfatases, partially purified from the hepatopancreas of the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, were investigated with respect to heterogeneity, catalytic requirements, and timing of induction during development. Four hepatopancreatic enzymes were purified from adult animals using a combination of hydrophobic interaction and anion-exchange chromatography. Zymograms of the four partially-purified enzymes produced by electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions revealed a fifth, relatively more basic isozyme. All four partially-purified enzymes appear to be monomeric, with molecular weights of approximately 43 000 Da each, as measured by gel filtration. The affinities for p-nitrocatechol sulfate, pH optima, and strengths of inhibition by anions displayed by these enzymes are similar to the values reported for other molluscan arylsulfatases. Three of the four enzymes have Km values between 0.8 and 2.0 m M for p-nitrocatechol sulfate; the remaining enzyme (A2) has a Km of 6.7 m M. All four enzymes have pH and temperature optima of 5.5 and 45°C, respectively. Three of the four enzymes have-t1/2(50°C) values of 3.5 min; the enzyme A4 has a t1/2 has a t1/2(50°C) of 8.5 min. A monoclonal antibody directed against form A1b does not cross react with any of the other hepatopancreatic arylsulfatases when assayed by Western blot, confirming the structural heterogeneity of the adult enzymes. Total arylsulfatase activity increases in a biphasic manner during early abalone development, with the first increase occurring early in larval maturation. The secoad phase of enzyme expression is dependent upon the induction of settlement and metamorphosis of the competent veliger larvae, strongly suggesting that the expression of arylsulfatase synthesis (and the maturation of the digestive gland, the hepatopancreas) is controlled by genetic events which occur as a result of metamorphosis. Competent veliger larvae express only two arylsulfatase forms, which share many physicochemical and kinetic characteristics with the adult hepatopancreatic enzymes. However, neither of the larval arylsulfatases is recognized by the monoclonal antibody to form A1b from adult hepatopancreas. Endogenous enzyme inhibitor levels in larvae remain constant throughout the period of arylsulfatase induction, and therefore do not contribute to the control of arylsulfatase activity levels during development. These results are the first documentation of the developmental induction of a specific protein(s) in abalone as a result of metamorphosis. The significance of the timing of arylsulfatase expression is discussed in relation to potential physiological substrates and the dietary switching which occurs at metamorphosis. Possible genetic events which are consistent with the observed patterns of expression of these enzymes also are considered. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/BF00257905

Optimum dietary protein level for growth",1995,Aquaculture,136,1-Feb,165,180,,"A 100 day growth experiment was conducted to identify the optimum dietary protein level for the juveniles of two species of abalone, Haliotis tuberculata and Haliotis discus hannai. A mixture of vitamin-free casein and gelatin (4.34:1) supplemented with crystalline amino acids was used as the protein source to simulate the amino acid profile of abalone body. Eight purified diets were formulated to provide graded protein levels ranging approximately from 0 to 50%. The weight gain, protein gain, soft body to shell ratio, and carcass levels of protein and lipid of both abalone species were significantly (ANOVA, P < 0.05) affected by the dietary protein level. The protein requirements of these abalone were evaluated from weight gain and protein gain respectively, by using the second-order polynomial regression analysis. On the basis of weight gain, the optimum protein levels were estimated to be 22.3-32.3%, and 23.3-35.6% for H. tuberculata and H. discus hannai, respectively. According to the protein gain, the statistical analysis indicated that the optimum ranges of protein requirements were 24.0-34.5% and 25.2-36.6% for H. tuberculata and H. discus hannai, respectively. Based on these results, about 35% dietary protein from good quality sources is recommended for the maximum growth of both abalone species; and, if dietary protein is reduced from 35 to 25%, the growth of these abalone may be depressed with 5% likelihood. © 1995.",10.1016/0044-8486(95)01041-6

Fusion products between wild (brown color) and mutant (green color) type protoplasts and between pairs of protoplasts of wild type were visually identified and used to determine the fusion efficiency. Cell wall digestions were carried out in solutions consisting of two kinds of enzymes. One was derived from the marine bacterium Pseudomonas sp. and the other was from one of the following sources: abalones Natohaliotis discus (AAP), top shells Turbo cornutus (TSAP), sea hares Aplysia kurodai (SHAP) or sea urchins Anthocidaris crassispine (SUAP). Both AAP and TSAP, either one combined with bacterial crude enzymes, showed approximately similar effects on the protoplast fusion. Under these enzyme treatments, a maximum of 15 to 20% of the isolated protoplasts formed hybrids after exposure to electric pulses. However, their fusion activities were quite unstable and the fusion rates declined immediately. Thus, fusion rates were only a few percent even when protoplast isolation reached maximum. In the case of the combined SUAP and bacterial enzymes, optimal fusion rate of protoplasts also was observed at approximately 20% but protoplasts could form hybrids with relatively high rates (more than 10%) for at least 2 h during enzyme treatment. Conversely, little or no fusion product was obtained from the protoplasts prepared with the combined SHAP and bacterial enzyme or with the combination of partially purified enzyme from abalone and bacterial, although protoplast production was effective in these solutions. Consequently, the combination of SUAP and bacterial crude enzyme was the most efficient enzyme system for protoplast electrofusion among all the systems examined. In addition, study of the survival rates of the algal protoplasts suggested that the electrofusion efficiency would be largely influenced by the viability of protoplasts during treatment with the wall-lytic enzymes. © 1992.",10.1016/0044-8486(92)90106-U
Tjeerdema R.S.; Kauten R.J.; Crosby D.G.,Interactive effects of pentachlorophenol and hypoxia in the abalone (Haliotis rufescens) as measured by in vivo 31P NMR spectroscopy,1991,Aquatic Toxicology,21,3-Apr,279,294,,"The effects of hypoxia and pentachlorophenol (PCP) were investigated in red abalones (Haliotis rufescens) using flow-through exposure and in vivo 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Following acclimation to clean seawater, three abalones were separately exposed to a 6-h sublethal concentration of PCP (1.2 mg 1-1) until the spectral resonance for inorganic monophosphate (Pi) was half-height to that of phosphoarginine (PA); the endpoint assured that all individuals were metabolically equivalent at the start of air exposure. They were exposed to clean seawater for 2 h to allow the effects from PCP to stabilize, then air for 45 min, and finally clean seawater for 15 h to check recovery. The effects of PCP in foot muscle included a decrease in the concentrations of PA and adenosine triphosphate ([PA] and [ATP], respectively), an increase in Pi, and a decrease in intracellular pH (pHi). Upon air exposure, [PA] and pHi rapidly declined further, [Pi] increased, and [ATP] did not change; the magnitudes were similar to those from emergence alone. After resubmergence, both [PA] and [Pi] recovered rapidly from the effects of hypoxia, but slowly from those of PCP. While pHi initially declined further, both [ATP] and pHi recovered to near-initial levels after 15 h. In general, the metabolic effects of hypoxia did not change upon pretreatment with PCP; the biochemical interaction of the two factors was additive. Another three abalones were separately exposed to PCP at an environmentally relevant concentration of 120 μg 1-1 for 6 h, air for 1 h, then the same PCP concentration for 2.5 h to check recovery. At the lower concentration, PCP produced no discernable effects, and those of hypoxia were similar to those without PCP. Since PCP produced no additional effects with or without hypoxia, it does not significantly impact red abalones at currently measured environmental concentrations. Use of in vivo NMR allows measurement of the interactive effects of multiple stress factors in live aquatic organisms, allowing assessment of the actual environmental effects of pollutants in the laboratory. © 1991.",10.1016/0166-445X(91)90078-N
Fleming A.E.,Digestive efficiency of the Australian abalone Haliotis rubra in relation to growth and feed preference,1995,Aquaculture,134,3-Apr,279,293,,"The digestibilities of dry and organic matter, energy and nitrogen were determined for Haliotis rubra feeding on a range of monospecific algal diets. These digestibilities, in conjunction with total intakes, were used to estimate the daily intakes of nitrogen and energy of abalone feeding on those algal species used by Fleming (1995). These were then used to explain the growth rates, intakes and chemosensory preferences of abalone in that study. The chemosensory preferences of abalone were strongly related to the digestible nitrogen content of the algae and to a slightly lesser extent the nitrogen content of the algae, indicating the important role nitrogen plays in setting preferences in this abalone. The intakes of digestible nitrogen were significantly related to the growth rates of abalone, suggesting that nitrogen is a limiting nutrient to abalone growth. Thus, H. rubra selects those foods which maximise the intake of nitrogen and result in maximum growth rates. Energy does not appear to play a major role in setting abalone preference as the digestible energy contents of algae in this study (and in general) are similar and did not correlate with preference. The digestible nitrogen content was lowest in the 3 brown algae tested and digestibility was related to the polyphenolic content of the brown algae. This suggests that the low growth of H. rubra on these species results from the action of polyphenolic compounds, reducing nitrogen digestibility. © 1995.",10.1016/0044-8486(95)00055-7

Protein Requirements for Growth of Abalone, Haliotis Discus",1964,NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI,30,6,523,526,,"It was reported in the previous paper (this journal, 29, 691 (1963)) that the young abalone showed good responses of growth by feeding the artificial diet composed of calcium alginategel in which various nutrients were kept. In this paper, the protein requirements of abalone, Haliotis discus. REEVE, were investigated by feeding the diets whose protein source was white fish meal (Table 1). The results of feeding trials are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 1. The diets were provided ad libitum throughout the experiments. The daily growth rates of abalone fed diets having protein levels from 20 to 30 percent were nearly constant in each experimental series and their values fell at the protein levels lower than 15 percent. The daily growth rates of abalone, however, increased considerably at the protein levels higher than 30 percent of the diet. From the present and previous results (Fig. 1) it was concluded that abalone required protein levels of about 20 percent in the artificial diet for the normal growth when the diet was provided ad libitum. The increases of the daily growth rate at higher protein levels may be attributable to the presence of unidentified growth factor(s) for abalone in the white fish meal, since there was no difference in amount of diet consumed among different groups. © 1964, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

Fleming A.E.,"Growth, intake, feed conversion efficiency and chemosensory preference of the Australian abalone, Haliotis rubra",1995,Aquaculture,132,3-Apr,297,311,,"Feeding trials were conducted on Haliotis rubra using single-species algal diets. Trials were done over 150-350 days and change in weight was measured at regular intervals. The 6 diets of single species tested were the red algae Jeannerettia lobata and Laurencia botryoides, the green alga Ulva australis, and the brown algae Macrocystis angustifolia,Phyllospora comosa and Ecklonia radiata. The greatest growth rate and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) for a single algal diet was with J. lobata (51.0 mg · day -1, 4.0% wet weight). The highest intake was of P. comosa (4.1% body weight), but this did not result in a high growth rate (0.8 mg · day-1). Neither intake nor FCE were correlated with growth rate, suggesting that these measures are not good indicators of the nutritional value of a food item. The hierarchy of food preference of H. rubra was determined for the 6 test diets of single species based on chemosensory attractiveness, involving direct tactile and gustatory sampling. Abalone exhibited distinct preferences, the most preferred being J. lobata and the least preferred the phenolic-rich E. radiata. The hierarchy of chemosensory preference for the algae tested was related to the growth rate of abalone when feeding on these algae. Thus, preference appears to be under selective pressure to ensure that abalone select foods that are nutritionally valuable, resulting in optimum growth rates. However, the low-phenolic brown algae, M. angustifolia and P. comosa, were less preferred than L. botryoides, despite the negative growth and mortality of animals feeding on this alga. © 1995.",10.1016/0044-8486(94)00347-Q

Intensive work has been carried out to test the utilization of Spirulina as mixed feed for abalone, scallops and penaeid shrimps. It was concluded that Spirulina mixed feed makes a good substitute for live microalgae in the cultivation of parent scallops. Spirulina mixed feed proved to be useful for the normal development of the scallop gonads, thereby achieving a higher fecundity and hatchery rate. Thus, the use of Spirulina mixed feed enhanced production of the Bay Scallop by giving them an advantage of about one month in the season, Also, mixed feed greatly simplified the feeding procedure, avoiding the change of temperature which would normally result from pouring large quantities of live microalgae into the production tanks. It was calculated that Spirulina mixed feed was cheaper than live microalgae. Some hatcheries have already adopted Spirulina mixed feed in their production of Bay Scallop larvae. © 1991.",10.1016/0960-8524(91)90159-H

Feeding a lipid free or an EFA deficient diet resulted in retarded growth and low feed conversion efficiency (FCE), together with an increased level of sterols in body lipids and ω9 fatty acids in the polar lipid fraction from both viscera and muscle. Addition of 18:2ω6 and 18: 3ω3 or ω3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (ω3 HUFA, a mixture of 20:5ω3 and 22:6ω3) to the diet improved weight gain and FCE. However, the effect of supplementation of 18:2ω6 or 18:3ω3 on growth and FCE was inferior to that of 20:4ω6 or ω3 HUFA. Feeding 18:2ω6 and 18:3ω3 resulted in elevation of 22:4ω6 and 22:5ω3 in the visceral polar lipids, respectively. However, such an elevation was not apparent in 22:5ω6 and 22:6ω3, suggesting a low ability of abalone to convert 22:4ω6 to 22:5ω6 and 22:5ω3 to 22:6ω3, respectively. These results indicate that the abalone requires ω3 and ω6 HUFA as EFA. Judging from the growth rate and EFA index, Σ9/(20:4ω6+20:5ω3+22:6ω3) which was less than 0.8 in the abalone receiving diets with sufficient amounts of EFA. The requirement of the abalone for ω3 HUFA was estimated to be about 1% of the containing 5% lipid. The requirement was also found to be variable due to dietary lipid level. © 1986, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science. All rights reserved.",10.2331/suisan.52.1013

In the starved treatment, the glycogen and triglyceride contents in both tissues were consumed within 30 days, and from then, the water soluble protein content decreased. The mortality ratio increased after 40 days and reached approximately 50% on the 70th day, suggesting that juvenile Haliotis discus discus are able to resist comparatively long-term starvation. However, abalones which were starved for more than 30 days were considered to show high physiological stress, that is with a reduction of behavioral activity and increase of mortality ratio due to degradation of water soluble protein. © 1995, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

Sakai S.,"Ecological Studies On the Abalone, Haliotis Discus Hannai Ino-I. Experimental Studies On the Food Habit",1962,NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI,28,8,766,779,,"1) A study on the food habit of the abalone, Haliotis discus hannai Ino, an industrially important gastropod in northern Japan, has been made by feeding it with 7 species of brown-algae, 2 species of green-algae, 3 species of red-algae, and diatom. 2) It has been clarified that brown-algae such as Undaria pinnatifida, Laminaria religiosa, Colpomenia bullosa are the most suitable food for H. discus hannai in respect to its growth and the efficiency of its food conversion, tìreen-algae, Ulva pertusa and Enteromor-pha linza come next in the food value. Red-algae such as Paehymenia sp., Rhodoglossum pul-cherum, Carpopeltis affinis etc. and brown-algae, Sargassum fulvellum are inferior in value as food for H. discus hannai. Melobesiae has also been found effective in the shell formation of the adult shellfish, 3) Diatom such as Melosira borealis or Navicula sp. has been found to be a suitable food even to adult abalones and they grow sufficiently well with this food alone. 4) When 2 species of algae are simultaneously given to abalones, they prefer Uiva pertusa to C. affinis, and Undaria pinnatifida to Ulva pertusa, showing some likes and dislikes. Generally speaking, when a mixed food is given to abalones, their growth are inferior to the growth of abalone, fed with algae which are superior as food. 5) It has been assumed that the optimum temperature for the growth of H. discus hannai is within the range of 15~20°C. 6) The efficiency of food conversion at the water temperature of 10 °C has been found to be 5~8% (12-21% in calorie equivalence) for abalones of 20~30g in weight fed with Undaria pinnatifida and 9~11% (24~29 cal. %) for ones of 60~90g in weight, and the case fed with Paehymenia sp. shows 8~13% (7 –11 cal. %) and 22~31% (20~28 cal. %) respectively, and in either case large sized abalones have shown higher rates, but the rates secured the stability at least between 50~100g in body weight. 7) For maintaining the body weight of abalones, necessary daily rates of feeding with U. pinnatifida are 1.75% (0.42% in calorie equivalence) and 0.65% (0.15 cal. %) respectively, for the ones of 20~30g and the ones of 60~90g in weight, and in the case fed with Pachy-menia sp. 0.82% (0.53 cal. %) and 0.08% (0.05 cal. %) respectively. These rates are smaller for the larger sized abalones. 8) The relation between the species of food and the maturation of gonad of abalones is in exact conformity with the relation between the species of food and the growth rate of abalones, and the food suitable for the growth of the shell also brings a good result to the maturation of gonad. 9) No significant difference in the chemical composition of the meat of abalones due to. © 1962, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

Lamellodiscus major was associated with fewer but larger foci containing more extensive infiltration, suggesting a more sessile habit. The copepod Dermoergasilus acanthopagri encircled the filament with its second antenna, occluded arteries and compressed the epithelium, resulting in hyperplasia, oedema and infiltration. Ergasilus lizae inserted its second antennae into the epithelium and subepithelial region and was associated with a localized proliferative response occasionally fusing adjacent filaments. The large copepod Lernanthropus atrox caused tissue disruption, hyperplasia, haemorrhage, oedema and infiltration. Hyperplastic epithelial cells had a rounded nucleus containing variable amounts of heterochromatin, dilated organelles, deposits of glycogen‐like particles, cyoplasmic vesicles and vacuoles. Oedematous epithelial cells were less altered. Degenerating chloride cells were present in both oedematous and proliferated epithelia. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell.

SHEPHERD S.A.,Movement of the Southern Australian abalone Haliotis laevigata in relation to crevice abundance,1986,Australian Journal of Ecology,11,3,295,302,,"The long‐term movement of the abalone Haliotis laevigata was measured at three sites in Waterloo Bay, South Australia, characterized by differing amounts of available crevice space. Movement was negligible at a site where crevices were abundant, but extensive at a site without crevice space. At a site of limited available crevice space, the amount of movement increased as available crevice space decreased. In addition, the extent of movement was size dependent and movement was oriented in the direction of the approaching swell. Current experimental designs for measuring natural mortality of abalone depend heavily on assumptions about their movement. An understanding of this behaviour is thus a prerequisite for designing experiments to measure the mortality rates of abalone or other sedentary animals. The natural mortality rate at one site was estimated to be 0.59 (s.e.m. = 0.02, i.e. survival = 56% per year) and the disappearance rate (natural mortality and emigration) was independent of sex.

Stewart J.; Schulz-Baldes M.,Long-term lead accumulation in abalone (Haliotis spp.) fed on lead-treated brown algae (Egregia laevigata),1976,Marine Biology,36,1,19,24,,"In this study we assessed the amount of lead accumulated in the body of a grazing mollusc by transfer from its algal food in laboratory experiments, and compared these results with the amounts found in naturally occurring molluscs and seaweed. Near La Jolla, California (USA), where the concentration of lead in seawater is probably less than 0.08 μg l-1, most of the naturally occurring Egregia laevigata contains less than 0.4 μg Pb g-1 wet weight. The total body masses, without shells, of juvenile Haliotis rufescens fed on this seaweed for 3 to 6 months showed similar concentrations. When, however, E. laevigata is placed for 1 to 6 days in seawater to which lead has been added (0.1 or 1.0 mg l-1) both the seaweed and the abalone subsequently fed with it accumulate proportionally larger amounts of lead. After 6 months, young abalone fed on E. laevigata pretreated with 1.0 mg Pb l-1 accumulated up to 21 μg Pb g-1 wet weight. This amount of lead had no apparent consequences on the growth or activity of the molluscs. Analyses of 6 different organs from adult abalone showed that the lead was selectively concentrated in the digestive gland.

Druehl L.D.; Breen P.A.,Some Ecological Effects of Harvesting Macrocystis integrifolia,1986,Botanica Marina,29,2,97,104,,"This field study, conducted for 17 months in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada, examined the effect of harvesting the kelp Macrocystis integrifolia Bory on some conspicuous elements of understory biota. M. integrifolia was completely removed from one plot, partially removed from one plot, and left undisturbed in a control plot. At the end of the study period, the relative abundance of the brown alga Desmarestia ligulata and the green alga Ulva sp. had increased in the harvested plots relative to the control plot. Harvesting, and the resulting changes in understory plant composition, were reflected in the relative abundances of drifting plant fragments available to herbivores. In harvested areas, brown algal fragments other than M. integrifolia (mostly D. ligulata) dominated during the winter; whereas in the unharvested site M. integrifolia dominated the fragment pool throughout the year. None of the herbivores studied (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus, S. droebachiensis, Parastichopus californicus, and Haliotis kamtschatkana) decreased their density in response to harvesting. Gonadal indices of the two sea urchins were lower in the harvested areas, which indicated that these grazers were less well fed. We conclude that removal of M. integrifolia altered the abundance of both understory plants and drifting fragments. These alterations change the forage base for associated herbivores to one which may be less nutritious than in unharvested situations. © 1986, Walter de Gruyter.",10.1515/botm.1986.29.2.97

This compound is known to cause photosensitivity in humans and animals. We have studied the mechanism of this phenomenon and shown that in the presence of pheophorbide a, visible light irradiation leads to the production of singlet oxygen. This, in turn, results in cell damage by oxidation of lipids, especially in the cell membranes. Further, we discovered that some kinds of vitamins display a preventive action against the photosensitivity caused by pheophorbide a. 2) It is well known that iodine dificiency causes edemic goiter in human subjects. On the other hand, many goitrogenic substances were found in various vegetables. We have studied the goitrogenic activity of soybean, and found that goitrogenic factors are some glucosides, saponin and isoflavonoids such as genistin and daidzin. In the process of this study, hyperplastic goiters were observed frequently in rats when they were given soybean under conditions of iodine deficiency for as long as 6 to 12 months. However, enlargement of the thyroid and malignancy were completely inhibited when a small amount of iodine was added to the diet. The study was undertaken to determine the involvement of intestinal bacteria in the induction of goitrogens from soybean glucosides using germ-free mice. It was found that germ-free mice were more sensitive to iodine deficiency than conventional mice, and it was suggested that iodine metabolism was modified significantly with intestinal flora.",10.1248/yakushi1947.104.5_423
Kopf G.S.; Lewis C.A.; Vacquier V.D.,Characterization of basal and methylxanthine-stimulated Ca2+ transport in abalone spermatozoa,1984,Journal of Biological Chemistry,259,9,5514,5520,,"Methylxanthines, such as 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (MIX) and theophylline, stimulate abalone sperm 45Ca2+ uptake in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. MIX is the most potent compound tested, and the ability of these compounds to alter 45Ca2+ uptake resides with methyl or isobutyl substitution of the xanthine nucleus at multiple sites. Methylxanthine-stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake does not occur as a secondary consequence of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibition, and added cyclic nucleotides are also without effect. The dramatic elevation of intracellular cAMP concentrations and induction of the acrosome reaction of sperm incubated with methylxanthines in the presence of Ca2+ is mediated by a primary effect of methylxanthines on Ca2+ transport. Basal 45Ca2+ uptake occurs through a verapamil-insensitive site that obeys the properties of a simple diffusion-mediated process. MIX-stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake occurs through a carrier-mediated transport site that has low affinity for Ca2+ (K(m) = 19.9 mM) and is verapamil sensitive. 45Ca2+ uptake through both basal and MIX-stimulated sites is enhanced by low extracellular Na+ concentrations (≤ mM) and is not affected by either extracellular Mg2+ or K+. 45Ca2+ uptake through both sites is pH sensitive, but this sensitivity is different for each site. These data suggest that methylxanthines can affect sperm function via primary effects on Ca2+ transport, which occur through a specific carrier-mediated site(s). It is possible that many of the previously described effects of methylxanthines on sperm function are mediated via such changes in Ca2+ conductance.",

There are also seasonal differences in growth rate between species and between sites. These differences as well as differences in the annual growth rate within a species between sites are associated predominantly with differences in the food supply.

Benthic diatoms on fibreglass plates served as food for post-larval stages to a length of 5–8 mm. Larger juveniles were fed the seaweeds Plocamium spp. and Ulva fasciata. Shell pigmentation is affected by the food consumed. Variable growth rates for individuals from the same spawning were observed. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",10.2989/025776188784480465

Over the duration of the experiment (15 months), estimates of the percent cover of macroalgae revealed no significant difference attributable to density except for crustose coralline algae which had significantly greater cover in high density enclosures. Drift seaweed, the preferred food of Haliotis iris was always present in low abundance (< 5% cover). There was no significant effect of density on the relative gut fullness or growth of H. iris, but significant variation in the dry weight of pedal muscle was due to density. Measurements of the dry weight of gonad and the ash-free dry weight of pedal muscle or gonad were otherwise similar between low and high density treatments for H. iris. Shell growth was similar among high density and low density treatments but high in relation to other populations of H. iris. Density independent growth is consistent with the feeding biology of H. iris and may apply to other species of abalone. © 1995.",10.1016/0022-0981(95)00031-L

A fraction of the liquid obtained from chromatography that was 22% carbohydrate and 44% protein was injected locally or systematically into ICR mice or BALB/c mice inoculated s.c. with allogeneic sarcoma 180 or syngeneic Meth-A fibrosarcoma, and growth of the tumors was strongly inhibited. There was an optimum dose range for the inhibition of the growth of sarcoma 180, and optimum timing. The fraction did not have antitumor activity in T cell-deficient nude mice (CD-1 nu/nu or BALB/c nu/nu mice), and administration of carrageenan in vivo decreased its activity in ICR mice. This fraction activated the cytostatic activity of peritoneal and alveolar macrophages in vivo. These results suggest that the antitumor activity is not due to a direct toxic effect but to stimulation of a host-mediated response. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/BF00205631

The factors contributing to this increase, aside from heavy demand and high price, include new techniques in catching the tiny clam seed (0.5 mm in size), success in mass production of seed of both species in hatcheries, better understanding of the molluscs' biology as well as their response to environmental changes, improved management of water quality to provide the optimal growth conditions, cheap and easy supply of Gracilaria for abalone feed, use of powdered formulated feed for hard clams, application of chicken manure and rice bran to enrich the water, intermediate harvest of animals of marketable size, and control of predators. However, major constraints to further development and expansion of molluse cultivation remain, including water pollution from industrial wastes, limited area with suitable water supply, strict regulations on the use of seashore land and littoral zone, and the lack of export market. Other species of molluscs, including the oyster Crassostrea gigas, the short-necked clam Comphina veneriforms, the purple clam Soletellina diphos, the cockle anadara granosa, and the small freshwater clam Corbicula, have potential for further expansion if problems of seed supply, water pollution, control of disease, and market price are properly solved. © 1984.",10.1016/0044-8486(84)90256-4

Santelices B.; Doty M.S.,A review of Gracilaria farming,1989,Aquaculture,78,2,95,133,,"Close to 5000 tonnes (t) of agar are processed annually from 25 000 to 30 000 t of Gracilaria, harvested mainly from the wild in Chile, Argentina, Brazil and South Africa and from fishpond culture in Taiwan, Hainan Island, China, and mainland China. Steady increases in market demand together with lack of crop management have led to overharvesting the natural stocks, to shortages of Gracilaria, to higher prices for the crop and, along with the increased market, to a demand for reliable crop quantity and quality. The outcome has been great interest in Gracilaria farming, and a diversity of farming methods has been developed. In open waters, basically three approaches are used for planting Gracilaria crops: on the bottom, on nets or lines, and on floating rafts. With each approach, either vegetative material or spores can be planted. Alternatively, Gracilaria can be farmed in ponds, raceways or tanks. A comparative review of these methods indicates that bottom planting and line farming techniques, either from spores or from vegetative material, may provide the crops for agar and agarose production. The species so cultured yield relatively large amounts of good quality seaweed by labor-intensive means at low cost in the less-developed countries. The future of fishpond cultivation of Gracilaria is difficult to predict. Perhaps the seaweed will continue to be cultivated as feed for more economically-important organisms, such as sea urchins and abalone. Production in tanks or mixed systems of pond cultivation, with or without air pumping or CO2 addition, probably will be restricted to supplying Gracilaria as a luxury-priced fresh vegetable. A variety of production ecology studies has been important in the development of the various farming methods, and increased requirements for farmed Gracilaria in the near future are likely to stimulate new approaches. Additional field population studies are required to increase the efficiency of wild crop management and bottom planting. Research on nutrient metabolism is crucial for tank cultivation. Understanding the environmental effects on gel production is needed to control the quality and quantity of gel produced under the various farming techniques. Farming involving the outplanting of sporelings will require further knowledge of Gracilaria spore biology, while biomass demands will probably stimulate new efforts in strain selection and Gracilaria farming methods. © 1989.",10.1016/0044-8486(89)90026-4
Winter F.C.; Estes J.A.,Experimental evidence for the effects of polyphenolic compounds from Dictyoneurum californicum Ruprecht (Phaeophyta: Laminariales) on feeding rate and growth in the red abalone Haliotus rufescens Swainson,1992,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,155,2,263,277,,"The effects of polyphenolic compounds from brown algae on grazing and growth rate of the California red abalone Haliotis rufescens Swainson were examined. Abalone consumed three phenolic-poor algal species, Laminaria sinclarii (Harvey) Farlow, Macrocystis pyrifera Agardh, and Nereocystis luetkeana Postels et Ruprecht (mean phenolic content = 0.52% dry mass), at a greater rate than two phenolic-rich species, Dictyoneurum californicum Ruprecht and Cystoseira osmundacea Agardh (mean phenolic content = 4.60% dry mass). This inverse relationship between phenolic content and consumption rate also existed after the algae were macerated and the liquid portion of the blended slurry incorporated in agar discs. However, the correlation between grazing rate and phenolic content imprpve d in this latter experiment, thus suggesting that abalone grazing was deterred significantly by the morphology of L. sinclarii and, to a lesser extent, of M. pyrifera. Polyphenolics extracted from D. californicum reduced abalone grazing rates by 90% when incorporated into agar discs at a concentration of 6 mg·ml-1. Although abalone were unable to maintain body mass when fed ad libitum on macerated M. pyrifera incorporated into agar discs, polyphenolics from D. californicum further inhibited shell growth when added to the discs at 5 mg·ml-1. The abalone ate less of the phenol-containing discs than of the discs lacking phenolics. Our results support findings of several prior studies that polyphenolic compounds from brown algae deter grazing by coastal zone herbivores in the northeast Pacific Ocean. © 1992.",10.1016/0022-0981(92)90067-K
Uki N.; Kemuyama A.; Watanabe T.,Nutritional Evaluation of Several Protein Sources in Diets for Abalone Haliotis discus hannai,1985,NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI,51,11,1835,1839,,"An experiment was conducted to evaluate nutritional quality of several protein sources in diet for juvenile abalone Haliotis discus hannai ino by feeding them diets containing each of protein sources at a 30% level for 40 days. Growth rate expressed as a relative value to that obtained in the group receiving a diet containing casein as a protein source and PER of each protein source were measured as follows, casein: 100, 4.2; soybean meal: 63, 2.6; leaf protein concentrate prepared from rye grass: 53, 1.9; egg albumin: 47, 1.6; whole egg: 44, 1.6; white fishmeal: 35, 1.7 and corn gluten meal: 23, 1.2, respectively. These values were the highest in the abalone fed with the casein diet, suggesting a high nutritional quality of casein as a protein source in diet for abalone. While the dietary value of egg albumin, whole egg and white fishmeal were far inferior to casein, being quite different from the case of fish. The difference in protein quality is postulated to be mainly due to difference of digestibility of each protein source in the juvenile abalone. Improvement of digestibility of white fishmeal will be required for development of practical abalone feeds. © 1985, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

Morse D.E.,Biochemical and genetic engineering for improved production of abalones and other valuable molluscs,1984,Aquaculture,39,1-Apr,263,282,,"Intensification of production, modernization of technique, and improvement of cultivars are needed to increase the economic efficiency of molluscan cultivation industries in the United States and certain other countries. To help achieve such improvements, modern methods of biochemical and genetic engineering can be adapted to control biological processes which intrinsically limit the efficiency and yield of molluscan production. Critical life-cycle stages of several species of abalones and other commercially valuable molluscs which thus far have proved amenable to improved control by these means include reproduction, larval settlement, metamorphosis, and acceleration of early growth. Analysis of the physiological and molecular mechanisms that control reproduction in molluscs reveals a prostaglandin-dependent regulation of spawning in abalones and certain other species. Spawning of gravid adults can be induced by the addition of prostaglandins to the surrounding seawater, or, more reliably and inexpensively, by activation of the endogenous enzymatic synthesis of prostaglandin-related spawning triggers in response to added hydrogen peroxide. Peroxide activation of the prostaglandin-dependent spawning reaction has been found widely useful for obtaining synchronous and copious release of fully competent gametes in a large number of species of abalones, oysters, scallops, mussels, clams, and other valuable molluses; a number of these species had not been successfully spawned by other methods. Settlement and metamorphosis of many species can be brought under similar biochemical control. The efficient induction of settlement and metamorphosis of the larvae of many Haliotis (abalone) species normally requires contact with any of several crustose red algae usually associated with natural recruiting substrates. This requirement can be met by providing competent larvae with the essential algae or with specific proteins purified from these algae, although production of these inducers is both time consuming and costly. Most conveniently and inexpensively, this natural requirement can be met by providing the larvae with certain unique amino acid constituents normally associated with the inducing proteins. Thus, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) can be used simply, safely, and inexpensively to induce complete and rapid larval settlement and metamorphosis - with minimal mortality - in many commercially important abalone species. This and similar neurotransmitter-related, amino acid-derived compounds are proving comparably effective for the reliable induction of settlement and metamorphosis in a number of other valuable molluscan species. Recent analyses of the requirements for rapid early juvenile growth in abalones reveals a mechanism of growth control which is susceptible to exogenous hormonal acceleration. Present experiments aimed at genetic cloning and amplification of recombinant-DNA templates for the essential growth-regulating hormones, progress in the establishment of useful molluscan gene banks, and potential uses of this technology for molluscan aquaculture are described. © 1984.",10.1016/0044-8486(84)90271-0
