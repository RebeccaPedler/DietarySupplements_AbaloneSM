A clear gap exists within the aquaculture literature regarding the optimal nutrition in the cultivation of New Zealand Haliotis iris. Further, there has been much research across aquatic species to suggest that the use of probiotics can successfully stimulate growth and decrease the time it takes to grow farmed Pāua. The overall aim of this thesis is to first investigate and identify an optimum feeding ration of the currently used formulated feed, which can improve growth and eliminate wastage of nutrients in Haliotis iris. Second, this thesis aims to evaluate the effects of the formulated feed with added probiotic bacteria on the ingestion, digestion, assimilation of Pāua, with the goal to increase growth rates. There are two growth trials in this study, conducted over 10 weeks, both of which used 160 juvenile abalone (20mm). First, the feeding ration trial compared the growth of Pāua samples from three treatment groups, fed on 3 different rations based on bodyweight of formulated feed (1%, 2%, 5%). Formulated feed rations were calculated by taking a percentage of the mean wet weight of all the Pāua in each feeding treatment. The second growth trial compares groups of Pāua fed with a probiotic (2%) and non-probiotic (2%) diet at an optimum feeding ration determined from the first trial. Three multi-strain probiotics were used in this study: Exiguobacterium sp. strain (JHEb1) and Vibrio sp. strain (JH1), and Enterococscus sp. strain (JHLDc). Growth (i.e., shell size, animal wet and dry weights) and survival of abalone were recorded throughout the experiment, with initial measurements at the start of the experiment and every two weeks for a total of 10 weeks. Shell length measurements were obtained by recording the greatest length. Wet weights were measured by lightly drying individual animals using tissues or hand towels for approximately 30 minutes and weighing them to the nearest 0.001g. In addition to these morphological and ...","2015","2025-05-21 23:13:23","2025-05-21 23:13:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","Auckland University of Technology","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Aquaculture; Haliotis iris; Maori aquaculture; Maori fisheries; Paua; Paua biology; Paua Haliotis iris diet; Probiotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has necessitated the application of biosecurity measures on fresh macroalgae to reduce or eliminate potential hazards and the risks of pathogen transfer to abalone stock when used as a feed or feed supplement. The present thesis assessed the efficacy of different processing treatments, including heat, ultra-violet irradiation (UVC), different pH levels, salinity concentrations, and povo-iodine on the inactivation of potential macroalgaetransmitted abalone pathogens. The effect of the processed macroalgae on the growth, health and gut microbial composition of abalone were also explored and compared with abalone fed non-processed diets. The efficacy of the different processing treatments was initially assessed on pure cultures of the test pathogens, which included a bacterium (Vibrio anguillarum), an oomycete (Halioticida noduliformans) and the bacteriophage lambda.

These inputs from donor systems, known as spatial subsidies, can profoundly shape habitats by influencing primary productivity, altering community interactions, impacting resilience, and changing species composition in recipient habitats. However, human activities such as global shipping and urbanization can disrupt these subsidies through increased nutrient flow, species introductions, and climate-mediated range shifts. In this dissertation, I investigate how invasive species in donor systems and human-mediated movement of organic material across habitats impact subsidy-dependent communities.Chapter 1 explores the impacts of an invasion-mediated shift in seaweed wrack from native kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, to invasive Devilweed, Sargassum horneri, on subsidy- dependent communities of rocky shores. The study assesses the species-specific impacts on common detritivores (Pagurus samuelis [Blue banded hermit crab], Pachygrapsus crassipes [Striped shore crab], and Tegula funebralis [Black turban snail]), the historically important but now endangered wrack-consuming giant snail (Haliotis cracherodii, [Black abalone]), an assemblage of these grazers, and common native benthic seaweeds (Centroceras clavulatum, Silvetia compressa, and Ulva spp.). Performance impacts are evaluated through long-term feeding assays using common Black turban snails and Haliotis rufescens (Red abalone), as a proxy for the rare Black abalone. Food preference was determined through feeding choice assays using individual species of these wrack detritivores, and a “community assay” in which an assemblage of these grazers fed on three native benthic seaweeds along with either native kelp or invasive Devilweed wrack are conducted. Performance varied among consumers, with abalone growing better on a kelp diet compared to Devilweed and showing intermediate growth on a ...","2024","2025-05-21 23:13:23","2025-05-21 23:13:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","eScholarship, University of California","","en","","","","","","","","","","","coastal communities; coastal ecology; Ecology; sargassum; spatial-subsidies; subsidies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most frequent pattern of food allergy is IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. As the global consumption of seafood grows, the prevalence of shellfish allergy has been increasing significantly. Unfortunately, so far, there is no cure for shellfish allergy. Many patients follow the elimination diet to protect themselves from the potential life-threatening consequence. Prawns and abalone are two of the most widely distributed shellfish species in the Asian-Pacific region and the in vitro IgE cross-reactivity between them has been reported. However, there is a lack of in vivo studies to comprehensively assess the degree of the immunological cross-reactivity between prawns and abalone and to identify the cross-reactive allergens. Mouse models are very useful tools to study allergic diseases. Without involving patients and possible health risks, the conditions of allergen exposure can be designed on experimental animals and subsequently substantial evidence for humoral and cellular responses can be obtained for the evaluation of potential allergic reactions. Therefore, in this PhD thesis, a mouse model has been developed for the in-depth assessment of the immunological cross-reactivity between prawns and abalone. Black tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon) has been selected for the development of this shellfish allergy model, because as one of the glorbally commercial seafood products the major allergens of Black tiger prawn (BTP) have been well characterised using immunochemical methods and mass spectroscopy. Moreover, tropomyosin is the most abundant allergen in BTP extracts, and has over 95% amino acid sequence identity with tropomyosins from other prawn species. Jade tiger abalone (Haliotis. laevigata × Haliotis. rubra) is one of the three main species of abalone farmed in Australia. The consuption but also the aquaculture facilities of Jade tiger abalone are rapidly expanding, nevertheless the allergenicity of this shellfish ...","2017","2025-05-21 23:13:23","2025-05-21 23:13:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although effects have been examined using standard toxicity assays, the impact of metals in more complex and realistic exposure regimes is still poorly known, in particular with regards to latent effects across multiple life stages and the interaction of multiple stressors. In this thesis, the effects of metals were investigated for multiple life stages of the endemic New Zealand sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus. Standard short-term bioassays were performed on the early life stage of E. chloroticus and also the endemic abalone Haliotis iris, for comparison. These assays evaluated the toxicity of three major pollutants (copper, lead and zinc) alone and in combination, on these species. Embryos of both species were highly vulnerable to copper (EC50s: 5.4 and 3.4 µg/L respectively for E. chloroticus and H. iris) and zinc (27.7 and 13.1 µg/L) but relatively tolerant to lead (52.2 and 775 µg/L), and there was no evidence of synergistic effects of metal mixtures. The latent effects of copper across two life stages in E. chloroticus, larval and juvenile, were investigated with laboratory experiments using realistic scenarios of low copper concentration, short pulses of exposure and examining exposure through dietary intake as well as waterborne exposure. Strong latent and carry-over effects were observed even at low concentration and short exposure time. For example, individuals exposed as larvae to 10.4 µg/L Cu for two days developed normally during the larval stage but had strongly impaired subsequent growth, with average body size decreasing by 24% in the 25 d following settlement. Moreover, juveniles previously exposed to copper as larvae were less resistant to a subsequent exposure, with up to four times higher mortality. Latent effects were especially important when copper was present in the diet rather than dissolved in water.

The research continues to grow on the impacts of climate change and developing solutions to mitigate its harmful effects on our industrial food systems is imperative for food security. Humans rely on a global food system spanning vegetation and terrestrial animals, with increasing growth in aquaculture. Understanding how changes in temperature and increases in carbon dioxide change our foods allows for mitigation and regulations to be implemented. It is well documented in agriculture how plants adapt to climate change and its effect on the nutrition of produce. With the growth of the seaweed farm sector, it is essential to understand how increasing temperatures change seaweeds and how these changes impact natural ecosystems. Changes in primary producers such as seaweed can reverberate throughout the food chain, impacting higher trophic levels, inducing stress, and degrading ecosystem health. To determine how the changes in nutritional composition that could result from climate change affect the growth of herbivorous animals, the direct effects of temperature on seaweeds needs to be understood. This project aimed to determine the changes in protein and carbohydrate concentration in a primary producer in varying temperature ranges and its influence on the growth of an herbivorous animal. The seaweed dulse, Devaleraea mollis, was cultured at three different temperatures (13°C, 15°C and 17°C) which was fed to juvenile red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) of two different size classes (small 15.6±1.76mm, and medium 42.86±4.65mm), and maintained in ambient seawater separate from the culture system. For the small size class, a total of 288 abalone were divided into 24 rearing troughs, (trough = experimental unit) with twelve abalone per trough, and randomly assigned to a diet treatment group.

Young (4 hours) and mature (7 days) and nine of twenty strains were mixed to each other microalgal biofilms were tested for their effectiveness on H. iris larval early developmental processes (attachment, metamorphosis, settlement and survival). Amino acid profiles and percent biofilm cover of microalgae also were monitored. Significantly better effects on attachment, metamorphosis, settlement and survival were found when abalone were exposed to mature microalgal biofilms compared to young biofilms, but few significant differences were found among biofilms composed of different microalgal species. Attachment and metamorphosis did not appear to be affected by differences in essential or non-essential amino acid profiles in the diets, but positive correlations were found between developmental processes and total amino acid content and percent biofilm cover. Similar results were also found in dual strains experiment. Nine commercially available protein sources (white fish, red fish, blood, meat and bone, casein, soybean, gluten, maize protein, Spirulina) were used as sole protein sources in formulated diets, which was fed to juvenile H. iris at 18 °C for five months. Juvenile abalone fed with diets containing white fish, red fish, casein, soybean and Spirulina had significantly better growth than those of fed other protein sources, thus indicating that these diets could be suitable as sole protein sources for H. iris formulated feeds. Abalone juveniles fed soybean diets (with extremely low methionine content) had similar growth results as those fed fish meal diets, and did not show a decrease in certain amino acid content (such as methionine) in their soft body tissues.

An initial study to identify the immunological aspects were by conducting characterization upon haemocytes using a combination of classical and novel (flow cytometry with Sysmex XN-1000 and Muse® Cell analyser) techniques. Two types of haemocytes were identified in this study, including type I (monocyte-like) and type II (lymphocyte-like) cells. Monocyte-like cells showed higher phagocytic activity when encountering Zymosan A particles compared to lymphocyte-like cells. The ability to successfully prepare and preserve haemocyte cells for microscopy and flow cytometry is critical for further investigation of the abalone immune system. Therefore, the study to apply different antiaggregants and handling protocols was conducted upon New Zealand black-footed abalone (H. iris) haemocytes. Results showed that Alsever’s solution was an effective antiaggregant, whereas K2EDTA Microtainer® tubes was similarly as effective as Alsever’s solution.

This industry is driven by a demand far exceeding supply, and natural stocks at the brink of depletion. A study was launched to gather clues from the basic physiological constituents in abalone, which will help in the management of abalone farms in South Africa. In 2003 an intensive literature study was launched to assess the availability of literature on abalone research, and to find research trends in published literature. From 2003 to 2005, basic physiological constituents (Including glucose, glycogen, proteins and lipids) were studied in abalone from six farms in South Africa. A two phased approach was followed, the first of which was an exploratory phase (2003 - 2004) where physiological constituents were studied six-weekly in the muscle tissue and digestive gland of abalone, in two size classes (±50 mm and 70 mm shell length) and four feeding regimes (natural, artificial and two rotational feeds), from one farm. At the end of Phase one, a single live export simulation trial was conducted following standard farm protocols. In Phase two (2004 - 2005), physiological constituents were studied seasonally in the muscle tissue and haemolymph of abalone, in two size classes (±50 mm and 70 mm shell length) and on two dietary regimes (natural and artificial feed), from five abalone farms, of which two had to withdraw from the project. Live export simulations were conducted seasonally in phase two. South Africa is one of the world leaders in publishing abalone research. The main focus of research in South Africa is on the development and enhancement of artificial diets. There is, however, a need for abalone research in South Africa to be diversified.

The species is also believed to have culture potential and accordingly control over reproduction is considered valuable. The major purpose of the study was to accelerate gonad development resulting in spawning outside the natural spawning season. Abalone were collected from Franklin sound in the Furneaux group of islands off the north-east tip of Tasmania. The important features of the conditioning tank were elevated water temperature, the provision of water movement within the tank to distribute feed to sedentary abalone and a diet of preferred red algae. Animals collected on 27 April 1990 were induced to spawn on 21 August 1990, 112 days or 1750 degree days following commencement of gonad conditioning. The natural spawning season of the source population was found to be November to March. A variety of methods for measuring reproductive development of abalone were used. This allowed the utility of individual methods to be examined and comparisons made between methods. Two gonad indices, the gonad bulk index (GBI) and the modified gonad bulk index (MGBI) were used as were a number of assessment methods with a histological component: oocyte size/frequency distribution, mean oocyte diameter, an ovarian phase method and percentage mature spermatozoa. The MGBI was considered more sensitive than the GBI, detecting first significant gonad growth following six weeks of gonad conditioning, compared to nine weeks for the GBI. The gonad indices increased from initial values of 14.1 ¬¨¬± 4.4, n=10 and 0.4 ¬¨¬± 0.2, n=10 for GBI and MGBI respectively to 72.3 ¬¨¬± 9.2, n=10 and 7.0 ¬¨¬± 2.0, n=10 following 105 days of gonad conditioning. Mean oocyte diameter (Am) increased from 30.7 ¬¨¬± 2.0, n=5 initially to 109.7 ¬¨¬± 6.0, n=5 during the same time period.

These commercial farms have a nursery system that utilises natural algal diets adhered to vertical plates for rearing postlarval and juvenile abalone. However, as the juvenile abalone grow (5 – 15 mm shell length), the current commercial nursery diet of the green alga Ulvella lens plus the diatom Navicula cf. jeffreyi does not supply adequate algal biomass to maintain commercially viable abalone growth rates at the required stocking densities. The focus of this research was to identify, develop and evaluate alternative macroalgal diets to overcome the restrictions in algal biomass during the later nursery phase. Macroalgae as an alternative natural diet for juvenile abalone can increase the algal biomass supplied on the vertical plates given its fast, 3-dimensional growth; while also considered a suitable nutrition source, as it is the primary feed of wild adult abalone. Australian abalone species have a preference for red macroalgae and to accommodate this, propagation methods including carpospore liberation, protoplast production and vegetative propagation; were assessed to determine the fitness of Rhodophyta species as an alternative diet for juvenile abalone in the later nursery phase. Protoplasts were readily isolated from red macroalgal species, however due to their limited regeneration, high cost of production and significant expertise required, the method was deemed unsuitable for utilisation in a commercial abalone nursery. Vegetative propagation successful established fragment culture of several red macroalgal species. The development of an artificial adhesion protocol, utilising active immobilisation processes through gel entrapment by the natural polysaccharide agar; enabled macroalgal fragments to be presented to juvenile abalone on the vertical plates in the nursery system.

The suitability of SBM was determined by a close evaluation of the following key factors: feed water stability, morphological impact on the abalone intestine and the effect on the growth performance of abalone. The study was comprised of two phases: a fish meal replacement phase (Phase A) and an enzyme treatment phase (Phase B). Diets used in Phase A consisted of a control fish meal diet (Control=22%FM, 0%SBM), a fish meal-soybean meal diet (FMSBM=20%FM, 15%SBM), a soybean meal-low diet (SBMlow=0%FM, 15%SBM) and a soybean meal diet (SBM=0%FM, SBM30%). In Phase B, the FM diet and SBM diet were used as basal diets (FME0 and SBME0). These diets were then treated with three commercial enzyme products, namely, a β- glucanase (FME1 and SBME1), xylanase (FME2 and SBME2) and α-D-galactosidase (FME3 and SBME3). Subsequently, all three enzymes were combined to make two treatments (FME123 and SBME123). With regard to the gut morphology and growth trials, a thirteenth energy enhanced commercial animal protein-free diet (ECO) was used. In Phase A (fish meal replacement), the findings revealed that water stability did not differ significantly between treatments. In Phase B (enzyme treatment) however, the water stability of β- glucanase treated feeds was significantly lower than that of the control FM diet. It was also observed that in comparison to the control FM diet, soybean meal based diets have a significantly greater effect on intestinal morphology. With reference to Phase A (fish meal replacement), by the end of the 240 day growth trial period, it was evident that animals fed on the commercial (ECO) diet were significantly heavier than those given the control FM diet.

At the end of each chronic bioassay, oxygen consumption, haemolymph ionic concentration and tissue microstructure were documented, relative to toxicant concentration. EC\\(_5\\) data (concentration causing a 5% growth reduction; whole wet body weight unless stated) indicated that these abalone were very sensitive to elevated levels of ammonia (0.041 mg FAN.I\\(^{-1}\\)), low dissolved oxygen (7.36 mg DO.l\\(^{-1}\\)) and low (7.78) and high (8.77) pH. Most of these variables affected shell growth relative to whole body growth, indicating some independence of nett shell and soft tissue growth rates. Greenlip abalone were also sensitive to nitrite on a growth basis. Modeling of the whole weight data indicated relatively uniform growth depression regardless of concentration in the range 0.56-7.80 mg NO\\(_2\\)-N.I\\(^{-1}\\).

The results of the present study show that the best time to start with semi-artificial spawning is from mid July using cultured abalone from the open sea in Guernsey, Channel Isles. Until 1996 Tetraselmis sueccica was the main source of food for juvenile H.tuberculata during their rearing stage (one to twelve weeks old) on glass plates. Nevertheless, this study showed that T. sueccica, as a sole food, is not sufficient for successful development and growth of early juvenile abalone. However, marine diatoms such as Skeletonema costatum, Navicula ramosissima and Cylindrotheca closterium were easily ingested and assimilated depending on the size of the animal and conditions of culture. This thesis studied the effect of different diets (mix of fresh seaweed, fishmeal and anabalone commercial) and temperatures (15, 18 and 22C) on growth and energy budget of juvenile abalone H. tuberculata over a 210 day period. Energy budget was obtained by Ingestion (I), Egestion (E), Somatic growth (Pg), Reproductive investment (Pr), Excretion (U) and Pedal mucus production (M). All these parameters were assessed for grouped and individual organisms. Animals fed on formulated diets (energetically rich) and cultured at 18 and 22C were shown to give better growth rates than the natural diet and preferentially allocated energy to gonad development. Thus, the combination of diet and temperature were factors that contributed to enhance growth rates and gonad development. The abalone commercial diet (CO) used in this study produced shell deformation in 89% of the population after four months of feeding juvenile abalone. The information of these studies have important implications when considering the nutritional requirements of cultured abalone when fed on formulated diets, which need to contain not only the energy, but also the necessary micronutients which are required to produce good ...","1999","2025-05-21 23:15:57","2025-05-21 23:15:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The utilisation of hydrolysed insect protein (HIP) was therefore evaluated against the performance obtained from fish meal-based aquafeed fed to South African abalone. The research presented in this thesis was conducted in three phases and is subsequently presented as such. Phase A evaluated chitin-target hydrolysis through dietary chitinase inclusion within extruded abalone feeds. Chitinase inclusion resulted in significant (P < 0.05) deterioration in water stability (WS). The lowest chitinase inclusion of 0.1% differed significantly (P < 0.05) from the control following 60 min water exposure. A significant reduction in the drying times of the respective treatments was observed. Drying times were correlated with WS and a rapid protocol for WS determination using drying times and drying curves was proposed. However, drying curves did not appear to correlate with WS, but was ascribed to prior drying and prolonged storage of the feeds. Due to the resulting feed disintegration and compromised WS, dietary chitinase inclusion in abalone feeds was not viable. Phase B subsequently evaluated the WS of aquafeeds containing pre-treated hydrolysed insect proteins (HIP), produced via hydrolysis by endogenous (autolysis), or chitinase or amylase enzymes. The respective HIPs were used to replace 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% of the FM component. A significant (P < 0.05) deterioration in the WS of the amylase and chitinase treatments compared to the control was observed following 360 min WS. Hydrolysed insect protein inclusion resulted in a significant, linear reduction in WS, with 80 and 100% FM replacement (11% and 14% inclusion respectively) yielding significantly (P < 0.05) lower WS compared to the FM control. Moreover, the high HIP amylase treatment consistently yielded lower WS compared to that of the control and chitinase treatments.

Their short-lived, rapid-growing lifecycle commands high feeding rates, which has the potential to impose strong top-down controls on the benthic communities where they are found. This Thesis investigated two major questions on the predatory role of octopuses on an abalone sea ranch in south-western Australia: (i) does the distribution of octopus on the sea ranch affect the mortality of Greenlip Abalone, Haliotis laevigata (Chapter 2), and (ii) what is the diet and nutrient assimilation (δ13C and δ15N) of Octopus cf. tetricus in this ecosystem (Chapter 3). Data were collected by commercial divers over a 27-month period on octopus abundance and the number of empty abalone shells at ~fortnightly to monthly intervals, and the number of abalone surviving on artificial abalone habitats (“Abitats”) every six months. These data were used to examine whether the number of empty shells, and the counts of surviving abalone were related to the presence of octopus. Negative binomial generalised linear models showed that the presence of octopus had a significant impact on the number of empty abalone shells collected and estimated that the shell counts are 78% higher when O. cf. tetricus is present when adjusting for location (“Line”) and Season. The Abitats provide an ideal habitat for octopuses, offering shelter and an abundant food supply. The relationship between octopus and shell counts was also influenced by the spatial position of the Abitats (Line) and Season, which may be linked to environmental variability and the time at which abalone are seeded. The results from time series (AR1) models for the relationship between octopus presence and abalone survival were not significant, contradicting those from the negative binomial models. This result is likely an artefact of the random sampling design for counting abalone to estimate survival and uncertainty in the number of abalone seeded onto each Abitat.

Sustainable management of H. iris stocks is a challenge for fisheries managers due to its reef scale variation in growth, recruitment, and survival. Customary mechanisms such as Mātaitai reserves and Taiāpure Local Fisheries provide the means to localise management and facilitate the use of science, local knowledge, and mātauranga Māori (traditional ecological knowledge), to inform decisions about the status and management of the fisheries. The present study aimed to use science and mātauranga as it relates to aspects of the reproductive ecology of H. iris to inform management within the East Otago Tāiapure (EOT). Three methods for accurately identifying sex in H. iris: visual identification, gonad biopsies and two methods based on mātauranga were tested. Each method was found to have its advantages with respect to simplicity, accuracy and invasiveness. Visually determining sex favoured simplicity, gonad biopsies were 100 percent accurate while mātauranga approaches were the least intrusive. Transect surveys were used to track the gonad development of H. iris within the EOT. Results indicated that individuals did not come into condition for spawning within the year surveyed supporting anecdotal evidence that H. iris in the EOT did not reproduce annually like other populations. Sex ratios also appeared to be male biased with seasonal variation in ratios apparent. A diet experiment utilising feeds of Macrocystis pyrifera and Ulva spp., two common macroalgae in the EOT, was used to consider the effect of diet on gonad development in H. iris.

The overall paradigm is trying to establish a relationship among total, external/ internal effect concentrations and target concentration profiles of metals in aquatic organisms. Emphases of the dissertation are on metal biouptake/ bioavailability dynamics and time-dependent toxicity. When these approaches successfully applied, the inherent hazard potential of heavy metals can be better estimated. We developed a mortality model, by coupling an acute toxicity model and a pharmacodynamic model, to predict survival of abalone (Haliotis diversicolor supertexta) exposed to waterborne zinc (Zn). We developed a mechanistic model based on the pharmacological area-under-curve (AUC) concept associated with a biokinetic rate model to predict relative bioavailable Zn to abalone. A laboratory 14-day exposure experiment was conducted to obtain biokinetic parameters for soft tissue and shell of abalone and their food source, red alga Gracilaria tenuistipitata var. liui. A 7-day acute toxicity test was conducted to obtain LC50(t) and time course of lethal body burden of Zn in abalone. Results of the mortality model demonstrate that 96-h LC50 and incipient LC50 for H. diversicolor supertexta exposed to Zn are 1.1 and 1.05 mg l-1, respectively. Our predictions show that equilibrium lethal body burden at site of action is about 198 µg g-1, whereas the mortalities never reach 50% when H. diversicolor supertexta exposed to Zn is ≤ 1 mg l-1. In addition, the AUC-based model demonstrates that during uptake phase of the exposure experiment, estimated relative bioavailable Zn to soft tissue and shell of abalone were 71.04 ± 9.71% and 68.44 ± 8.29%, respectively.

These commercial farms have a nursery system that utilises natural algal diets adhered to vertical plates for rearing postlarval and juvenile abalone. However, as the juvenile abalone grow (5 – 15 mm shell length), the current commercial nursery diet of the green alga Ulvella lens plus the diatom Navicula cf. jeffreyi does not supply adequate algal biomass to maintain commercially viable abalone growth rates at the required stocking densities. The focus of this research was to identify, develop and evaluate alternative macroalgal diets to overcome the restrictions in algal biomass during the later nursery phase. Macroalgae as an alternative natural diet for juvenile abalone can increase the algal biomass supplied on the vertical plates given its fast, 3-dimensional growth; while also considered a suitable nutrition source, as it is the primary feed of wild adult abalone. Australian abalone species have a preference for red macroalgae and to accommodate this, propagation methods including carpospore liberation, protoplast production and vegetative propagation; were assessed to determine the fitness of Rhodophyta species as an alternative diet for juvenile abalone in the later nursery phase. Protoplasts were readily isolated from red macroalgal species, however due to their limited regeneration, high cost of production and significant expertise required, the method was deemed unsuitable for utilisation in a commercial abalone nursery. Vegetative propagation successful established fragment culture of several red macroalgal species. The development of an artificial adhesion protocol, utilising active immobilisation processes through gel entrapment by the natural polysaccharide agar; enabled macroalgal fragments to be presented to juvenile abalone on the vertical plates in the nursery system.

The suitability of SBM was determined by a close evaluation of the following key factors: feed water stability, morphological impact on the abalone intestine and the effect on the growth performance of abalone. The study was comprised of two phases: a fish meal replacement phase (Phase A) and an enzyme treatment phase (Phase B). Diets used in Phase A consisted of a control fish meal diet (Control=22%FM, 0%SBM), a fish meal-soybean meal diet (FMSBM=20%FM, 15%SBM), a soybean meal-low diet (SBMlow=0%FM, 15%SBM) and a soybean meal diet (SBM=0%FM, SBM30%). In Phase B, the FM diet and SBM diet were used as basal diets (FME0 and SBME0). These diets were then treated with three commercial enzyme products, namely, a β- glucanase (FME1 and SBME1), xylanase (FME2 and SBME2) and α-D-galactosidase (FME3 and SBME3). Subsequently, all three enzymes were combined to make two treatments (FME123 and SBME123). With regard to the gut morphology and growth trials, a thirteenth energy enhanced commercial animal protein-free diet (ECO) was used. In Phase A (fish meal replacement), the findings revealed that water stability did not differ significantly between treatments. In Phase B (enzyme treatment) however, the water stability of β- glucanase treated feeds was significantly lower than that of the control FM diet. It was also observed that in comparison to the control FM diet, soybean meal based diets have a significantly greater effect on intestinal morphology. With reference to Phase A (fish meal replacement), by the end of the 240 day growth trial period, it was evident that animals fed on the commercial (ECO) diet were significantly heavier than those given the control FM diet.

Two experimental diets, namely, a seaweed diet (SWD) Laminaria pallida (macrophytic algae) and a formulated diet (FD) (macro-algae), for use in abalone (Haliotis midae) feed development, were evaluated. The animals used in this study were juveniles (24.33 ± 3.14 mm shell length; 2.72 ± 0.83 g live weight, mean ± SE) and sub-adults (58.07 ± 10.33 mm shell length and 41.96 ± 20.61 g live weight, mean ± SE). The nutrient profile of the SWD and FD displayed no differences in the protein and carbohydrate levels. Crude protein levels ranged from 4.91 to 17.68% (dry matter (DM) basis). The lipid levels in the FD (0.25%) were almost 0.56% lower than that in the SWD (0.76%). The feed conversion ratio (FCR) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) for the sub-adult abalone ranged from 2.80 to 10.90 and 0.10 to 0.40, respectively. The juvenile abalone fed on the FD yielded significantly lower (P < 0.05) FCRs (0.8) and higher PERs (1.20) than their counterparts fed on the SWD. A similar trend was observed for the sub-adult abalone although the differences were not significant (P > 0.05). The relative growth rate (RGR) of juvenile fed on the FD was 25% lower compared to those fed on the SWD, while that of the sub-adult abalone fed on the FD was 29% lower compared to the abalone fed on the SWD.

Haliotis midae is the most important aquaculture species produced in South Africa, and is exported to the Eastern markets in a variety of forms, with live export and canned abalone being the two most important products. To meet the high international demand, abalone farmers need to remain competitive by optimizing growth rate, increase water absorption, and minimising the stress and moisture loss experienced by abalone during the live export period. Stress and moisture loss experienced during export can potentially contribute to a decrease in live weight and meat quality, which in turn will result in lower income generated, which will impact negatively on the cost-efficient production of abalone. No literature is available on reducing moisture loss in live abalone during export. Other factors such as diet composition (which can affect the growth rate of abalone), animal health condition (assessed by weight of the abalone per unit shell length), and meat composition and quality, can also affect the cost-efficient production of abalone. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the amount of moisture loss experienced by adult live abalone that have reached an export size, and to formulate a complete balanced diet that will minimize the moisture loss during export. Aspects that were investigated included a) the effect of diet on the growth rate of abalone, b) the effect of diet composition on moisture loss during live export of abalone, c) the effect of diet on the extent of post mortem and post cooking moisture loss, and d) the effect of diet composition on proximate and chemical composition of abalone meat.

However, industries such as mussel and abalone canning generate significant quantities of waste shells, often discarded into landfills or public water bodies, causing environmental issues like coastal pollution, foul odours, and sanitation challenges. Despite mussel and abalone shells containing up to 98% calcium carbonate—a valuable industrial resource—their extreme toughness, shaped by biomineralization, makes size reduction and valorisation through comminution processes difficult. Efficient recovery of calcium carbonate from these shells could reduce reliance on limestone mining, but existing methods are energy-intensive and under-optimized. This study aims to develop a processing strategy to improve the comminution performance of mussel and abalone shell waste into industrially ready calcium carbonate, reducing environmental impacts and dependence on limestone mining. The shells were roasted in a retort kiln at temperatures ranging from 300 °C to 480 °C and for times between 10 and 45 minutes, followed by ball milling for durations of 15 to 45 minutes. Optimal conditions for mussel shells were found at 400 °C for 25 minutes of roasting and 30 minutes of milling. Compositional analysis confirmed the safety of the material, with mussel and abalone shells containing 98.4% and 98.1% calcium carbonate, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that calcium carbonate decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide beyond 600 °C. Untreated shells could not achieve the target particle size of 0.5 mm for lime applications, with milling achieving a P80 of 2.1 ± 0.3 mm for mussel shells and 4.4 ± 0.5 mm for abalone shells. Roasting pretreatment was essential for altering shell structure, enabling improved comminution performance.

The overall paradigm is trying to establish a relationship among total, external/ internal effect concentrations and target concentration profiles of metals in aquatic organisms. Emphases of the dissertation are on metal biouptake/ bioavailability dynamics and time-dependent toxicity. When these approaches successfully applied, the inherent hazard potential of heavy metals can be better estimated. We developed a mortality model, by coupling an acute toxicity model and a pharmacodynamic model, to predict survival of abalone (Haliotis diversicolor supertexta) exposed to waterborne zinc (Zn). We developed a mechanistic model based on the pharmacological area-under-curve (AUC) concept associated with a biokinetic rate model to predict relative bioavailable Zn to abalone. A laboratory 14-day exposure experiment was conducted to obtain biokinetic parameters for soft tissue and shell of abalone and their food source, red alga Gracilaria tenuistipitata var. liui. A 7-day acute toxicity test was conducted to obtain LC50(t) and time course of lethal body burden of Zn in abalone. Results of the mortality model demonstrate that 96-h LC50 and incipient LC50 for H. diversicolor supertexta exposed to Zn are 1.1 and 1.05 mg l-1, respectively. Our predictions show that equilibrium lethal body burden at site of action is about 198 µg g-1, whereas the mortalities never reach 50% when H. diversicolor supertexta exposed to Zn is ≤ 1 mg l-1. In addition, the AUC-based model demonstrates that during uptake phase of the exposure experiment, estimated relative bioavailable Zn to soft tissue and shell of abalone were 71.04 ± 9.71% and 68.44 ± 8.29%, respectively.

Sustainable management of H. iris stocks is a challenge for fisheries managers due to its reef scale variation in growth, recruitment, and survival. Customary mechanisms such as Mātaitai reserves and Taiāpure Local Fisheries provide the means to localise management and facilitate the use of science, local knowledge, and mātauranga Māori (traditional ecological knowledge), to inform decisions about the status and management of the fisheries. The present study aimed to use science and mātauranga as it relates to aspects of the reproductive ecology of H. iris to inform management within the East Otago Tāiapure (EOT). Three methods for accurately identifying sex in H. iris: visual identification, gonad biopsies and two methods based on mātauranga were tested. Each method was found to have its advantages with respect to simplicity, accuracy and invasiveness. Visually determining sex favoured simplicity, gonad biopsies were 100 percent accurate while mātauranga approaches were the least intrusive. Transect surveys were used to track the gonad development of H. iris within the EOT. Results indicated that individuals did not come into condition for spawning within the year surveyed supporting anecdotal evidence that H. iris in the EOT did not reproduce annually like other populations. Sex ratios also appeared to be male biased with seasonal variation in ratios apparent. A diet experiment utilising feeds of Macrocystis pyrifera and Ulva spp., two common macroalgae in the EOT, was used to consider the effect of diet on gonad development in H. iris. Results showed that though M. pyrifera contained higher percentages of the fatty acids arachidonic acid (20:4(n-6)) and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5(n-3)), which are considered essential to reproduction, individuals fed M. pyrifera lost both gonad and general body condition. Isotope analysis revealed that very little of the M. pyrifera was being consumed, ...","2013","2025-05-21 23:17:51","2025-05-21 23:17:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Otago","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Haliotis iris; Blackfoot Paua; East Otago Taiapure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
