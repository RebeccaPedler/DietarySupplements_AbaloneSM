The use of biofouling Sargassum horneri (SH) as additional macroalgal biomass for abalone has been studied, albeit full inclusion is discouraged due to low utilization. This study applied heat treatment and fermentation to increase the nutritive value of SH meals for the aquaculture feed industry. Untreated (UN) as control, heat treated (HT, 121°C for 20 min), and fermented (FE, 107 CFU/mL each of Bacillus sp. SJ-10 and Bacillus sp. KRF-7) SH meal was fed to the abalone (11.60 ± 0.02 g body weight and 42.98 ± 0.53 mm shell length) for 8-wk growth trial. The results showed that there is no apparent difference in the growth performance (body weight and shell length morphometrics) and survival of abalone given experimental diets (P > 0.05). The crude protein, lipid, and ash composition of edible abalone flesh were similarly unaffected (P > 0.05). The gut microbiota profile of abalone was analyzed through next-generation sequencing. The α-diversity indicators (microbial richness and abundance) were statistically similar (P > 0.05), and the β-diversity of operational taxonomic units revealed short distances within samples and clustering among diet groups. The core phyla (Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Tenericutes) and genera (Psychrilyobacter, Vibrio, Mycoplasma) known to inhabit the gut of abalone predominantly were likewise identified irrespective of diets; however, there is a difference in their relative abundance. Genus Psychrilyobacter was relatively abundant in UN and FE compared with HT, whereas Vibrio and Mycoplasma had higher abundance in FE and HT-fed abalone, respectively. Taste sensory attributes were discriminated in the abalone meat using an electronic tongue. Principal component analysis of sensor scores revealed several overlapping points, resulting in a negative discrimination index (-184), which means no apparent difference in the general taste profile was detected. Furthermore, the taste screening matrix through radar mapping revealed slight intensity differences in the umami, saltiness, and sourness flavor. Overall, the methods used for heat treatment and fermentation procedures herein were ineffective in improving the nutritive value of seaweed meal for abalone. © 2024 National Shellfisheries Association.

The aim of this study was to analyze inter-annual variation in recruitment, mortality, total and vulnerable biomass, selectivity, and harvest rate of Haliotis fulgens. A size-structured model was used to assess changes in the population dynamics and management quantities from 2010 to 2019. The model describes the exploitation and growth of individuals in the population, and incorporates a stochastic growth matrix that defines the variation in the length increments of individual to individual. Key results indicated that the recruitment failures occurred in infrequent pulses of varying intensity. Moreover, a slight recovery of total biomass during 2017 (791 t), 2018 (1496 t), and 2019 (1274 t) was observed after a slight increase in recruitment and a decrease in harvest rate. The vulnerable biomass increased 44.38% from 2010 to 2019. The harvest rate revealed that individuals larger than the minimum legal size of 145 mm were under high fishing pressure. The stock assessment model highlights an adverse effect in the population; given the deteriorating conditions of the green abalone fishery, it is imperative to transition fully to a recovery strategy, including all the administrative zones in the assessment and management. The adoption of proactive strategies such as the establishment of reference points, no-fishing reserves, and the implementation of a farming system would facilitate the protection of critical abalone populations, contributing to their medium-term recovery, and would be an economic alternative for local fishers. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2024.107134,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85189434181

The economic viability of commercial abalone farming depends largely on the rearing system employed and the feeding sources employed during the grow-out culture period. We studied the effects of two land-based culture systems on the growth performance of abalone and the nutritional quality of their tissues, in a crossed design. Recirculated (RAS) and open flow (FLOW) culture systems were compared. Fresh macro algae (FMA) (Gracilaria cornea and Ulva rigida) were compared to manufactured compound feed (CF) and a mixture of both (MIX). Survival rates were high (97–100%) regardless the treatments tested. MIX and FMA diets produced the best results for Shell Growth Rate, Specific growth rates for shell growth (SGRsl) and weight (SGRw) as well as Food Conversion Ratio (FCR). The highest value for feed intake was recorded for the MIX diet. A positive relationship has been observed between the amounts of protein and lipids in diets and the disposition of these in the viscera of animals fed such diets. The rearing system used had no significant effect on growth and nutritional parameters. © 2024 The Royal Society of New Zealand.",10.1080/00288330.2024.2359110,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85194774998

For example, the loss of the native main food, Macrocystis pyrifera, and the subsequent takeover of non-indigenous algae species represent a major threat to abalone growth and survival. In Baja California, Mexico two introduced macroalgae, Undaria pinnatifida and Sargassum horneri have become common in the past decade with unknown consequences on native herbivores. In this work, we explored the effect of these invasive algae on the growth and survival of juvenile red abalone, Haliotis rufescens. One hundred and ten juvenile red abalone were tagged and fed with invasive algae U. pinnatifida and S. horneri, and a control with M. pyrifera. Then, the shell length, body weight, and survivorship were assessed monthly for 90 days. Results show that abalone fed U. pinnatifida had a total growth in length, weight, and survivorship, similar to those fed native M. pyrifera. In contrast, abalone fed S. horneri had significantly lower overall performance. Marine heatwaves and other climatic impacts are expected to favour the establishment of invasive species. These results may be relevant to inform local fisheries and management efforts in this area under future scenarios. © 2023 The Royal Society of New Zealand.",10.1080/00288330.2023.2278735,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85176730054

The modified PDA medium supplemented with either 0.4% yeast extract (MT1), or 0.4% yeast extract and 0.5% peptone (MT3), was found to be suitable for mycelial propagation. In addition, MT3 medium was found to be superior as it did not affect successive mycelial growth on seed medium. Furthermore, among the 4 testing different culture media, G2 medium with a mixture of 95.0% rubber sawdust, 5.0% rice husk, 3.0% corn powder, 1.0% sugar, 1.0% CaCO3, 0.03% NH4Cl, 0.03% MgSO4, and 0.03% KH2PO4 was found to be the most suitable compost for spawn running and had a biological efficiency of 39.62±3.89%. In summary, a propagation medium and a culture compost for abalone mushroom cultivation are identified. An alternative compost culture with 90% rubber sawdust and 10.0% rice husk is proposed to ensure the rational use of rubber sawdust resources in the future. © 2024 Association of Agricultural Technology in Southeast Asia.

The basal diet was designed with 20 % of FM. Based on it, the FM was replaced by SPC at 0 (CON), 25 % (SPC25), 50 % (SPC50), 75 % (SPC75) and 100 % (SPC100), respectively. After the 110-day feeding trial, it was shown that completely replacing FM with SPC had no adverse effects on growth, feed utilization and body composition of abalone. The highest weight gain rate of abalone was 119.52 %, which was observed in the SPC25 group. The trypsin activity in the digestive gland within the SPC25 and SPC50 groups exhibited a significant increase compared to that in the remaining groups. Relative to the CON group, the SPC100 group showed a significant reduction in total antioxidant capacity and an increase in malondialdehyde content within the cell-free hemolymph (CFH). The myd88 mRNA expression in the SPC25-SPC75 groups was significantly decreased compared with other groups. The highest expressions of pi3k, mtor and s6k, and the lowest expression of 4e-bp were found in the SPC25 group. The hardness of muscle was significantly increased with the increasing dietary SPC levels. The CON, SPC25, and SPC50 groups exhibited significantly lower cumulative mortality rates among abalones following the V. parahaemolyticus challenge. In conclusion, in terms of growth, FM can be totally replaced by SPC. Furthermore, replacing 25 % of dietary FM with SPC led to a significant enhancement in abalone growth. Moderately replacing FM with SPC (up to 50 %) could improve abalone digestive capacity and did not significantly affect abalone survival following a V. parahaemolyticus challenge. The optimal replacement level of FM by SPC (≤ 25 %) triggered the PI3K/AKT/TOR pathway to promote protein synthesis. Considering the growth, digestion, immunity, muscle quality and disease resistance of abalone, it is recommended that dietary FM can be replaced by SPC not more than 50 %. © 2024",10.1016/j.aqrep.2024.102368,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85204576831
Guo Z.; Hou X.; Chang L.; Du Z.; Shi K.; Song A.; Liang Z.; Gu J.,"Effects of different feeding patterns on growth, enzyme activity, and intestinal microbiome of the juvenile Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai",2024,Aquaculture Reports,39,,,,102427,"In northern China, the predominant food sources for abalone farming include fresh kelp, salted kelp, and formulated diets, and abalone can also endure prolonged starvation when food is scarce. While there is a dearth of comprehensive investigation into the effects of these feeding patterns on the temporal dynamics of enzyme activity, and intestinal microbiome of abalone. In this study, a total of 3600 juvenile Pacific abalones were allocated to 12 tanks, randomly divided into four groups based on the feeding patterns: fresh kelp (labeled as FK), salted kelp (SK), formulated feed (FF), and starved group (S). After a 60-day feeding trial, the results showed that abalone in the FK, SK, and FF groups exhibited significant positive effects on both weight and shell growth compared to the S group (P<0.05). Notably, the FF group displayed the highest values of the growth performance. The activity of digestive enzymes and antioxidant enzymes in the FF group had an up-regulated trend over the course of feeding trial, whereas amylase and lipase activity in abalone declined along with starvation. Moreover, the microbial Shannon index showed an overall decreasing trend over time in the FF, FK, and SK groups except for the S group. The ANOSIM analysis revealed that both feeding pattern and cultivating time significantly influenced the structure of the microbial communities. Across the feeding trial, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteriota, and Firmicutes were identified as the dominant phyla in the intestinal microbiome of abalone under different feeding patterns. The core genera were Psychrilyobacter, Mycoplasma, and Vibrio. Additionally, the neutral model analysis revealed that stochastic processes both play a key role in shaping the assembly of microbial communities in different feeding patterns. This study could offer valuable insights into the impact of different feeding patterns on growth and physiology of abalone, thereby contributing to the enhancement of management strategies in the northern Chinese abalone aquaculture industry. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.aqrep.2024.102427,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207153240
Huang J.; He J.; She Z.; Zhou M.; Li D.; Chen J.; Ke C.,Transcriptome Analysis of Muscle Growth-Related circRNA in the Pacific Abalone Haliotis discus hanna,2025,Genes,16,1,,,65,"(1) Background: Animal growth is a complex process, involving the coordination of a wide variety of genes, non-coding RNAs, and pathways. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) belong to a novel class of functional non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). They have a distinctive ring structure and are involved in various biological processes, including the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of muscle cells. The Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai is an economically valuable mollusk species cultivated in China. However, the modulation of muscle growth by circRNAs in this species is poorly understood. (2) Methods: In this study, we analyzed the muscle transcriptomes of 6 H. discus hannai specimens: three small (S_HD) and three large (L_HD) groups via RNA-seq and bioinformatics technology. (3) Results: The results indicated the presence of 11,744 circRNAs in abalone adductor muscle. Furthermore, the L_HD group had 250 significantly differentially expressed circRNAs (106 upregulated and 144 downregulated) relative to the S_HD group. Moreover, the bioinformatics assessment revealed that circRNAs were related to lipid transporter activity, lipid biosynthetic process, fat digestion and absorption, the single-organism metabolic process, the thyroid hormone signaling pathway, and the hippo signaling pathway, which regulates growth. Seventeen key candidate circRNAs were identified, and a core functional circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network associated with abalone muscle growth was described. Gene expression was verified using qRT-PCR, confirming the accuracy of the RNA-seq data. (4) Conclusion: Overall, this investigation furnishes novel evidence for the potential muscle growth modulatory mechanisms in Pacific abalone. These high-quality circRNA data of abalone muscle provide a reference for functional studies on the abalone genome. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/genes16010065,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215761822
Zhao Z.; Peng L.; Zhao Q.; Wang Z.,"Genome-Wide Identification, Expression and Response to Estrogen of Vitellogenin Gene Family in Sichuan Bream (Sinibrama taeniatus)",2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,25,12,,,6739,"To enhance our understanding of teleost reproductive physiology, we identified six Sichuan bream (Sinibrama taeniatus) vitellogenin genes (vtg1-6) and characterized their sequence structures. We categorized them into type Ⅰ (vtg1,4,5 and 6), type Ⅱ (vtg2) and type Ⅲ (vtg3) based on differences in their subdomain structure. The promoter sequence of vtgs has multiple estrogen response elements, and their abundance appears to correlate with the responsiveness of vtg gene expression to estrogen. Gene expression analyses revealed that the vitellogenesis of Sichuan bream involves both heterosynthesis and autosynthesis pathways, with the dominant pathway originating from the liver. The drug treatment experiments revealed that 17β-estradiol (E2) tightly regulated the level of vtg mRNA in the liver. Feeding fish with a diet containing 100 μg/g E2 for three weeks significantly induced vtg gene expression and ovarian development, leading to an earlier onset of vitellogenesis. Additionally, it was observed that the initiation of vtg transcription required E2 binding to its receptor, a process primarily mediated by estrogen receptor alpha in Sichuan bream. The findings of this study provide novel insights into the molecular information of the vitellogenin gene family in teleosts, thereby contributing to the regulation of gonadal development in farmed fish. © 2024 by the authors.",10.3390/ijms25126739,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197152875

Using FAO and World Bank data, this study compares per capita shellfish consumption in China and other major countries from 1976 to 2022, identifying trends and proposing targeted strategies. Key findings include: (1) In 2022, China’s per capita consumption reached 10.52 kg, significantly higher than 1976 and 2000 levels and 16.44 times the global average, though lower than in Chile and South Korea; (2) In terms of sub-categories, China’s per capita consumption of oysters, clams, and scallops is well above global averages, while abalone and mussels have room for growth; (3) ARIMA (0,1,1) model can simulate and predict the apparent consumption and trend of shellfish per capita in China, with per capita consumption expected to reach 11.21 kg in 2025 and 16.77 kg in 2050;(4) Under the open economy, China’s shellfish consumption is primarily supported by domestic supply, while imports mainly serve to supplement high-quality products and meet the demands of the domestic premium shellfish market. In the context of insufficient domestic industrial upgrading and limited supply of high-quality products, the import of premium, fresh shellfish products is expected to increase in the future. It is recommended to accelerate the upgrading of the domestic shellfish industry, promote market-oriented processing, and cultivate product branding to enhance demand dynamics, drive high-quality industrial development, and support the implementation of major national strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",10.1007/s10499-025-01982-1,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003467847

Moreover, nuclear power plants (NPPs) also release excess thermal energy into the environment, contributing to rising seawater temperatures and exacerbating this threat. However, studies on the potential negative impacts of thermal pollution on mariculture are scarce, especially in field environments. Herein, a comparative investigation of hybrid abalone (Haliotis discus hannai ♀ × Haliotis fulgens ♂) under thermal stress was performed in laboratory and field to evaluate the potential ecological risks of NPP thermal discharge. The survival rate, behavioral changes, antioxidant enzyme activity, and transcriptional profiles of antioxidant-relevant genes were determined in hybrid abalones under thermal stress. Under a natural water temperature of 29 °C, an increase of 4 °C led to the death of all abalones. In the field study, a temperature increase of 2 °C resulted in the partial death of these abalones and a decrease in their adhesion capacity, which did not occur in laboratory. In addition, thermal stress caused considerable changes in the antioxidant enzyme activity in these abalones, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase, and malondialdehyde content. Moreover, transcriptional levels of sod, cat, and heat shock protein 70 genes were substantially induced in laboratory and field studies. The integrated biomarker responses version 2 (IBRv2) method was used to comprehensively assess the effects of thermal discharge on the abalones. The relationship between the IBRv2 values and thermal stress is not linear. These results provide valuable information for policy makers regarding the impacts of thermal discharge on marine aquaculture and the importance of establishing aquaculture safety zones near NPPs. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.aqrep.2024.102239,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85198908828
Crimp J.; Meyer L.A.; Horstmann L.; Hollarsmith J.A.; Montiel M.; La Cruz F.L.-D.; Frederick A.R.; Licht W.; Umanzor S.,"Effect of Macroalgal Diet on Growth Rate and Nutrition of the Pinto Abalone, Haliotis kamtschatkana",2025,Journal of Shellfish Research,44,1,21,30,,"Developing methods for the cultivation of the pinto abalone, Haliotis kamtschatkana, has seen increased attention, both by groups using restoration aquaculture to reestablish endangered populations in Washington and British Columbia, and in the State of Alaska, where pinto abalone are viewed as a promising new species for commercial mariculture. To enhance the viability of cultivating H. kamtschatkana for commercial and restoration purposes, more information is needed on the optimal macroalgal diet that maximizes abalone growth and nutrition. This study compares the suitability of two commonly cultivated species of macroalgae as feed: Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp), a kelp with relatively low protein content, and Devaleraea mollis (Pacific dulse), a rhodophyte with comparatively high protein content. Fifty H. kamtschatkana specimens, with a mean shell length of 45.25 ± 4.26 mm, were collected from the wild and fed either S. latissima, D. mollis, or an alternating diet of the two for 28 wk. Feed consumption was measured weekly, whereas shell length and weight change were recorded every 2 mo. Despite consuming significantly more S. latissima than D. mollis (P < 0.001, H. kamtschatkana showed no significant difference in specific growth rate (SGR) (P = 0.775) or linear growth rate (LGR) (P = 0.746) among the diets. Feed conversion efficiency (FCE) was significantly higher for D. mollis than S. latissima (P < 0.001), although there was no significant difference in protein efficiency ratio (PER) (P = 0.129). Proximate composition analyses of abalone tissue showed no significant difference in protein, lipid, carbohydrate, or caloric content across macroalgae diets. Additionally, sexual dimorphism was observed, with females exhibiting significantly higher daily feed consumption (DFC) (P = 0.001), SGR (P = 0.003), and LGR (P = 0.001) than males. These results indicate that whereas both macroalgae species are suitable as feeds for H. kamtschatkana cultivation, the benefits of a D. mollis diet are less pronounced compared with other commercially cultivated abalone species.

The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, SEM, and EDS. The calcium phosphate crystallographic phase family (Ca-P) includes brushite (DCPD), monetite (DCPA), and hydroxyapatite (HAP) surrounding the nucleating crystals that had plate, petaloid, and pseudo-hexagonal or hexagonal morphologies. Crystal growth nucleation by Sr inclusion ions induces preferential orientation with overlapping layer plates forming pseudo-hexagonal or hexagonal crystals with high symmetry when there is ion equilibrium between Ca and Sr. This result indicates biomimicry crystals found in nature (abalone gastropod shell), resulting in promising materials for further advances in mechanical properties and performance. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.molstruc.2024.139030,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85196277070
Li A.; Li J.; Liu L.; Xue S.; Zhu L.; Mao Y.,Path analysis of body weight and shell morphological traits in two Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) strains,2024,Aquaculture International,32,3,2493,2505,,"The effect of morphological traits on the body weight of Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) was investigated by correlation analysis, path analysis and multiple regression analysis. We evaluated the relationships between shell length (SL), shell width (SW) and body weight (BW, the total wet weight) in two different strains of Pacific abalone. One strain is ‘Huangxun No. 1’, which is from the fifth generation of a novel strain that has experienced higher shell growth rate selection, and the other strain is a first-generation descendant of wild Pacific abalone. The results of the correlation analysis showed that both SL and SW were significantly (p < 0.05) positively correlated with BW in both strains. Path analysis showed that SL significantly affected the BW of the ‘Huangxun No. 1’ strain, while SW significantly affected BW at only one of the four ages tested. Both SL and SW significantly affected the BW of the wild strain at the four ages tested. The determination coefficients of SL on BW in the ‘Huangxun No. 1’ strain at 3, 6, 13 and 19 months of age were 0.835, 0.141, 0.834 and 0.708, respectively, while those in the wild strain were 0.476, 0.237, 0.344 and 0.141, respectively. In addition, the SL/SW in the ‘Huangxun No. 1’ strain ranged from 1.453 to 1.509, while that of the wild-type strain ranged from 1.389 to 1.497. The allometric growth analyses showed positive allometric growth for ‘Huangxun No. 1’ from 3 to 19 months of age, while the wild strain did not show such growth. These results suggest that multiple generations of selection for a higher SL growth rate may have led to variation in shell morphological traits and that shell width may be a less important factor in determining body weight in the ‘Huangxun No. 1’ strain, while shell length can be used as an effective morphological trait for selective breeding to increase body weight. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",10.1007/s10499-023-01281-7,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85173032838

The results show that the coating forms an FCC+σ eutectic structure. The FCC matrix phase has an abalone crystal structure. The diffraction angle of the FCC crystal plane (111) is positively correlated with the remelting temperature, while its diffraction peak intensity and grain size are inversely correlated. Unlike the coatings obtained at remelting temperatures of 1150°C and 1230°C, where the σ phase is a Mo poor phase, the coating obtained at the remelting temperature of 1190°C has a Mo-rich phase. The coating has the lowest self-corrosion current density (3.31 μA/cm2), the highest self-corrosion potential (−0.3797 V), the highest polarization impedance (69 616 Ω), and impedance modulus (23 205.68 W cm2). Its impedance modulus is 2.89 times and 2.04 times higher than those of the coatings remelted at 1150°C and 1230°C, respectively, demonstrating excellent electrochemical corrosion resistance. This can be attributed to the comprehensive effect of various factors, such as FCC+σ dual phases, dense coating structure, and excellent passivation film. © 2025 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",10.1002/maco.202414520,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214996624

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary CAP inclusion on the anti-oxidation, immunity, inflammation, disease resistance and gut microbiota of abalone Haliotis discus hannai after a 110-day feeding trial. Three isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets were formulated by adding 0 % (control), 4.10 % (CAP4.10) and 16.25 % (CAP16.25) of CAP, respectively. A total of 540 abalones with an initial mean body weight of 22.05 ± 0.19 g were randomly distributed in three groups with three replicates per group and 60 abalones per replicate. Results showed that the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in the cell-free hemolymph (CFH) were significantly decreased and the content of malondialdehyde in CFH was significantly increased in the CAP16.25 group. The diet with 4.1 % of CAP significantly increased the activities of lysozyme and acid phosphatase in CFH. The expressions of pro-inflammatory genes such as tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α), nuclear factor-κb (nf-κb) and toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) in digestive gland were downregulated, and the expressions of anti-inflammatory genes such as β-defensin and mytimacin 6 in digestive gland were upregulated in the CAP4.10 group. Dietary CAP inclusion significantly decreased the cumulative mortality of abalone after the challenge test with Vibrio parahaemolyticus for 7 days. Dietary CAP inclusion changed the composition of gut microbiota of abalone. Besides, the balance of the ecological interaction network of bacterial genera in the intestine of abalone was enhanced by dietary CAP. The association analysis showed that two bacterial genera Ruegeria and Bacteroides were closely correlated with the inflammatory genes. In conclusion, the 4.10 % of dietary CAP enhanced the immunity and disease resistance as well as inhibited the inflammation of abalone. The 16.25 % of dietary CAP decreased the anti-oxidative capacity of abalone. The structure of the gut microbiota of abalone changed with dietary CAP levels. © 2024",10.1016/j.fsi.2024.109737,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197050202

Alternative ingredients, such as insect meal and grape marc, are suitable for aquaculture nutrition due to their nutritional profile and more sustainable production methods. This study assessed the effect of dietary insect meal and grape marc on gut microbial composition, digestive system morphology, and muscle metabolome of Haliotis iris. Juvenile abalone were fed four encapsulated experimental diets with varying levels of insect meal/grape marc and a commercial feed for 165 days in a commercial farm. The gut health of abalone was evaluated through histopathology, and 16S rRNA amplicon libraries through Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The abalone metabolome was evaluated through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results showed that animals had good intestinal condition across all dietary treatments. Microbiome analysis revealed increased relative abundances of bacteria (Firmicutes and Fusobacterium) associated with the breakdown of polysaccharides in diets including insect meal and grape marc. Metabolite profile variations indicate that the inclusion of insect meal and grape marc favoured fatty acid metabolism and amino acid catabolism, respectively. This study provides foundation to produce more sustainable feeds including insect meal and grape marc without affecting the gut and overall health of abalone. © 2023 The Author(s).

Luo Q.; Zhang M.; Lyu M.; Ke C.; Gao X.,Structure and function of vasa gene in gonadal gametogenesis of Pacific abalone,2024,International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,277,,,,134449,"Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) is a marine gastropod mollusc with significant economic importance in both global fisheries and aquaculture. However, studies exploring the gonadal development and regulatory mechanisms of Haliotis discus hannai are limited. This study aimed to explore whether the vasa gene acted as a molecular marker for germ cells. Initially, the vasa gene was successfully cloned using the cDNA-end rapid amplification technique. The cloned gene had a 2478-bp-long open reading frame and encoded 825 amino acids. Then, a recombinant expression vector was constructed based on the Vasa protein, and an 87-kDa recombinant protein was prepared. Subsequently, a polyclonal antibody was prepared using the purified recombinant protein. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed the titer of the antibody to be ≥512 K. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Vasa was widely expressed in oogonia, Stage I oocytes, spermatogonia, and primary spermatocytes. The specific expression of Vasa in the hermaphroditic gonads of abalone was assessed using western blotting to investigate the effects of different photoperiods (12 L:12D, 24 L:0D, 18 L:6D, and 6 L:18D) on the gonadal development of abalone (P < 0.05), with higher expression levels observed in the ovarian proliferative and spermary maturing stages compared with other developmental stages (P < 0.05). Additionally, Vasa exhibited the highest expression in the spermary and ovary under a photoperiod of 18 L:6D (P < 0.05). These data demonstrated the key role of Vasa in developing germ cells in abalone. They shed light upon the molecular mechanism through which the photoperiod influenced Vasa expression and regulated gonadal development in abalone. The findings might provide theoretical references for analyzing the differentiation pattern of abalone germ cells and the genetic improvement and conservation of germplasm resources. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.134449,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85200206163

Sludge has been proposed as a feed stock for polychaete production, which in turn can be utilized live in shrimp aquaculture or as an aquafeed ingredient. However, the biosafety of such value chains has not yet been addressed. We conducted an experiment exposing the polychaete Hediste diversicolor to aquaculture sludge spiked with four different fish pathogens (Mycobacterium salmoniphilum, Yersinia ruckeri, Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis (IPN) and Infectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA)) known to cause diseases in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Moreover, we assessed whether heavy metals and other potentially hazardous elements present in fish sludge bioaccumulates in the polychaetes. Neither of the bacteria nor viruses could be detected in the polychaetes after 14 days of continuous exposure. Seven of the 15 elements we analysed showed bioaccumulation factors significantly below one, meaning biodilution, while the other eight did not differ from one, meaning no bioaccumulation. None of the elements showed a significant bioaccumulation. Further on, none of the heavy metals found in the polychaetes at the end of our experiment exceeded the EU regulatory maximum levels for fish feed ingredients. The current results suggest that a H. diversicolor can reared on aquaculture sludge, and aquaculture sludge may serve as feed stock for polychaete production without the product exceeding EU regulations for contaminants in animal feed. © 2024",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.122073,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85200341183

Meanwhile, the postprandial metabolic responses varied greatly among different species, nutrients and fasting time. In the present study, postprandial metabolic responses of abalone Haliotis discus hannai fed with different levels of dietary methionine (0.46%, 1.19% and 2.07%, respectively) for 84 days were investigated. Compared with the group with 0.46% of dietary methionine, 2.07% of dietary methionine significantly increased the concentration of glucose in CFH at 0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 60 h and 84 h, while the concentrations of ammonia were significantly decreased by 2.07% of dietary methionine at each time point after feeding (P < 0.05). The 1.19% of dietary methionine significantly increased the activity of trypsin at 0 h, 24 h 60 h and 84 h after feeding (P < 0.05). The phosphorylation levels of protein kinase B (AKT), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and ribosomal s6 protein (S6) peaked at 12 h and then dropped to base level at 36–84 h. Compared with the group with 0.46% of dietary methionine, 1.19% of dietary methionine significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of AKT at 12 h and 24 h, and extended the phosphorylation time of AKT (P < 0.05). And the phosphorylation level of mTOR was significantly increased by 1.19% of dietary methionine at 12 h, 24 h and 36 h after feeding (P < 0.05). Significant activation or repression of the mRNA levels related to glucose and lipid metabolism were observed at 12–24 h after feeding, and most of which were remain stable at 36–84 h (P < 0.05). The expressions of genes related of insulin signaling pathway (phosphoinositide 3-kinase and protein kinase B), glycolysis (hexokinase) and transport of lipid (fatty acid transport protein) were significantly increased by 1.19% of dietary methionine, while the key gene of gluconeogenesis (glucose-6-phosphatase) were decreased. In summary, 1.19% of dietary methionine could enhance digestive and absorptive capacity, protein synthesis, glucose metabolism and fatty acid transportation of abalone. Take long-term feeding trial with dietary methionine as an example and combine the results of data analysis, it is suggested to analyze the protein level of mTOR signaling pathway within 36 h after feeding, assess the biochemical parameters in CFH and the mRNA levels of nutrient metabolism related genes within 36–84 h, and detect the activities of digestive and absorptive enzymes within 60–84 h. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.741473,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85200997503

This mushroom contains bioactive compounds such as alkaloids, flavonoids, polyphenols, rutin, quercetin, and triterpenoids that act as antidiabetics and anti-inflammatory agents. Research on using P. cystidiosus mushrooms cultivated in Cianjur, West Java, is rare. These mushrooms are only used as daily food; besides that, their activity as antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory has never been reported or investigated. This research aimed to determine and examine the potential of P. cystidiosus mushroom micro encapsulant as an antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory agent. The research method was an experiment using 30 male white rats of Rattus norvegicus with 200 g body weight (BW) that induced streptozotocin (STZ) dose of 45 mg/kg BW, and divided into 6 groups: HGCt (healthy control, no treatment), NGCt (negative control, induced STZ only), PGCt (given metformin 45 mg/kg BW), TGM1 (given microencapsulant 150 mg/kg BW), TGM2 (given microencapsulant 200 mg/kg BW), TGM3 (given microencapsulant 250 mg/kg BW) for 15 d. The research approach was post-test-only with the control group and complete randomized design (CRD). The results showed that P. cystidiosus microencapsulant contained polyphenols (3.61 mg), flavonoids (2.21 mg), alkaloids (5.51 mg), amino acids (3.67), and triglycerides (3.78 mg).

Remarkably, the BCFRC features a unique coordination of high strength (1204 MPa), high toughness (6.29 MJ·m−3), and high stiffness (104 GPa) in tensile tests, benefiting from the co-effect of energy dissipation of brick-and-mortar architected laminates (first-stage RFCS) and the resistance to stress concentration of resin matrix embedded with silanized particles (second-stage RFCS).

This research focuses on northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana) in Haida Gwaii, the home of the Haida Nation. The Haida have developed a range of values associated with abalone, including reciprocity. However, commercial fishing and colonial mismanagement have led to overexploitation, resulting in a prohibition on all gatherings since 1990. Despite this, the relationship between the Haida and abalone persists in the community's knowledge. We used the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) framework and the concept of reciprocal contributions to help paint a complex relationship between Haida knowledge holders and abalone, identifying values, benefits, drivers and barriers. We identified food uses and meanings that include emotional experiences. Additionally, we compiled an array of reciprocal contributions, such as enhancement actions, fishing guidelines and nature protection practices. These memories and guidelines have been passed down through generations. The principle of ‘take only what you need to eat’ is essential for managing abalone populations. Reciprocal actions have been crucial for both abalone and the Haida. Elders have transplanted abalone to other sites, and the Council of the Haida Nation continues monitoring and restoration work. Cultural and ecological education about abalone is preserved through family stories, school activities and ceremonies, reinforcing its status as a culturally important species. The abalone fishing boom and Canadian mismanagement were identified as negative drivers that significantly impacted abalone populations. Most Haida elders recall their efforts in the 1970s to raise concerns with the federal fishing agency about the declining abalone population, but their warnings went unheeded. Currently, due to limited enforcement capacity, abalone poaching is the primary concern, while bureaucratic hurdles in decision-making processes impede effective assessment and management. This work contributes to reviewing the past and rethinking management strategies in local contexts where values like reciprocity remain integral to Indigenous people. It also aims to generate dialogues and actions with international fisheries platforms, facilitating learning from other local experiences and recognizing common colonial barriers worldwide.

This study aimed to assess the effect of culture methods and tank cleaning frequency on abalone growth, water quality, and sludge characteristics. The study was conducted for 16 weeks. Four treatments were used, namely, abalone cocultured with sea cucumber cleaned once (AS1) and twice weekly (AS2); abalone monoculture cleaned once (A1) and cleaned twice weekly (A2). Abalone (initial avg weight = 40.9 g) were maintained under commercial stocking conditions in flow through systems at a salinity of 35 ppt and fed a commercial formulated diet (Abfeed™) and fresh seaweed (Ulva lacinulata and Gracillaria gracilis). The stocking densities were 200 abalone m−2 and 50 sea cucumbers m−2. The sea cucumbers (initial average weight = 12.5 g) fed on the abalone faeces and leftover feed, which settled at the abalone tank's bottom (sludge). There was a significant interaction between the type of culture and the frequency of cleaning on abalone weight (F (1,476) = 12.41, p < 0.001). Abalone in the A2 treatment group showed higher growth (p = 0.006) than those of the A1 treatment group, while abalone in AS1 had significantly higher growth (p < 0.001) than those in the AS2 treatment group. Also, abalone in AS1 showed higher growth (p = 0.026) than abalone in the A1 treatment. However, abalone in AS1 had growth similar (p = 0.53) to those in A2. The survival rate of the sea cucumbers was high, however, the sea cucumbers experienced a reduction in weight regardless of the treatment. This study showed that growth optimisation in abalone farming can be achieved by cleaning tanks twice instead of once weekly. However, when abalone are cocultured with sea cucumber, tanks need only be cleaned once a week without compromising abalone growth or water quality. The coculture of abalone and sea cucumber results in an additional aquacultured product, a significant reduction in labour and other associated costs of cleaning, without an additional cost of production. © The Author(s) 2024.",10.1007/s10499-024-01508-1,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191946130

The use of abalone interspecific hybrids is gaining attention due to their improved growth and tolerance to environmental challenges. However, hybrids may respond differently to dietary inputs compared to their parental species, which could be optimized to achieve maximum growth potential. Accordingly, we previously reported that the postlarvae of a hybrid cross obtained by mating red and green abalone (H. rufescens [♀] x H. fulgens [♂]) presented higher growth and survival rates than red abalone postlarvae when fed with Macrocystis pyrifera (M) and a mixture of Ulva onhoi and Navicula incerta (UN). Here, to gain a deeper insight into the physiological and metabolic responses of both crosses, we report the results of a transcriptome sequencing analysis to unveil the diet-driven physiological changes within each cross. Our findings indicate that the diet induces modulation in the transcriptional machinery related to macromolecules breakdown, especially, the mixed diet UN induced higher expression of lysosomal enzymes, especially in enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan catabolism, such as arylsulfatases, glucosidases, and alpha-fucosidases, which might indicate a higher ability to break down complex carbohydrates from algae. These transcriptional responses might explain the growth difference between pure and hybrid as well as for abalone fed with M and UN. © 2025",10.1016/j.cbd.2025.101484,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000168573
Abdulsalam G.; Ahmad I.,Comparative investigation of quantum and classical kernel functions applied in support vector machine algorithms,2025,Quantum Information Processing,24,4,,,109,"Quantum kernels in modern computational paradigms present a revolutionary approach to machine learning by harnessing the power of quantum mechanics to redefine how data is processed and analysed. This study examines the performance and applicability of quantum kernels in machine learning models by investigating their potential among different tasks and datasets against classical kernels. The study utilized the radial basis function (RBF), linear, polynomial, and sigmoid classical kernel functions besides quantum kernel and fidelity state vector quantum kernels. The classical support vector classifier (SVC) and quantum support vector classifier (QSVC) with classical and quantum kernels were employed to perform classification tasks on different datasets, namely Cleveland, Framingham, CHSL, Glass Identification, Obesity, and Academic Success. Additionally, support vector regressor (SVR) and quantum support vector regressor (QSVR), employing classical and quantum kernels, were applied for regression tasks using Concrete, Abalone, Aquatic Toxicity, Auto MPG, and Auction Verification datasets. The results of the study provided insights into the performance of quantum kernels when applied to both classical and quantum SVM models regarding classification and regression tasks. In classification tasks, the quantum kernels provided significant competitiveness in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 measure scores when compared to the classical kernels. Moreover, the quantum kernels have demonstrated promising outcomes in regression tasks, outperforming the classical kernels by achieving less mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and superior R-squared scores. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.",10.1007/s11128-025-04728-3,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002885937

This two-part experiment aimed to investigate first (i) the dose effect of replacing soy protein concentrate with SCP in Australian hybrid abalone diets (Haliotis laevigata Haliotis rubra) and second, (ii) the potential for improved palatability of the SCP by using commercially produced liquid protein hydrolysate (PH). This was assessed in a 2 × 2 factorial experimental design. The diets were formulated to be iso-proteic (~40% crude protein as fed) and iso-energetic (~18 MJ kg−1 as fed). The diets (SCP 0%, SCP 5%, SCP 10%, SCP 20%, SCP 0% + PH, and SCP 20% + PH) were fed to the abalone (~9.25 g initial weight) once daily in the evening for 94 days to apparent satiation. The growth performance and feed utilization of abalone fed with up to 10% SCP was comparable to the control; however, there was a significant reduction in most parameters at the highest inclusion of 20%. In the second experiment, there was a decline in measured protein and energy retention in the abalone fed 20% SCP, with a concomitantly lower apparent biological value. Positively, there were significant improvements in the apparent digestibility of the diet at the 20% SCP inclusion. There was no significant impact of using the PH on growth performance or feed intake. No effects were observed on the digestive enzyme activity (α-amylase, lipase, and trypsin) examined among the treatments. Considering these results collectively, the maximum recommended inclusion of methanotrophic SCP meal should be 10% for hybrid abalone. Reasons for the decline in performance at the highest inclusion may be related to palatability; however, this remains to be fully confirmed. Copyright © 2025 Michael J. Salini et al.

There are seven recognized species in the genus, including the endemic and vulnerable E. galapagensis. Despite some remarkable morphological variations, Eisenia species are characterized by two twisted stipe-like parts arising from the main stipe. Genetic data have recently contributed to the understanding of Eisenia systematics; however, additional studies on E. desmarestioides, E. cokeri, and E. gracilis are needed. Aside from economic benefits, Eisenia farming has various other essential benefits, such as resource sustainability and ecosystem benefits, which are especially important in climate change scenarios. Spore-based cultivation has been reported only for E. arborea, E. bicyclis, and E. nipponica (formerly known as E. arborea sensu Arasaki). This kelp is widely consumed in Korea and Japan and utilized as a raw material for alginate production and feed for abalone cultures. Because of its nutritional composition and mineral concentration, Eisenia is also a potential food source outside Asia. Moreover, various pharmacological applications of Eisenia have been reported, particularly those related to antioxidant, antidiabetic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Phlorotannins (brown algal polyphenols) derived from E. bicyclis are linked to these bioactivities. In this work, we present a comprehensive synthesis of the current state of knowledge on Eisenia, offering insights into its taxonomy, distribution, ecology, cultivation, and various applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",10.1007/s10811-024-03264-4,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85192915126
Lebata-Ramos M.J.H.L.; Solis E.F.D.,"Grow-out culture of the abalone Haliotis asinina in Guimaras, Philippines: comparison of tubes and drums as culture containers and the effects of serpulid infestation",2025,Aquaculture International,33,3,,,175,"This study compared tubes and drums as containers for the grow-out culture of abalone Haliotis asinina using mixed seaweeds and formulated diet as feed. The recycled drums were newly tested containers for abalone culture as the cheaper and larger alternative. However, on the 10th month of culture, serpulids (Pomatoceros sp. and Spirorbis sp.) were observed on the abalone shells; hence, the 12-month culture was extended to 16 months to observe further the effects of these ectoparasites on the growth and survival of abalone. Throughout the culture period, abalone reared in tubes had significantly higher mean shell length and body weight than those reared in drums, measuring 45.42 ± 0.36 mm, 23.40 ± 0.99 g, and 41.45 ± 0.23 mm, 18.26 ± 0.40 g at harvest, respectively. Mean growth rates of those in tubes were significantly higher than those in drums before serpulid infestation but did not differ during months of infestation. Survival was consistently higher in tubes than drums, except during May–September 2023. At harvest, survival in tubes was 46.7 ± 11.0%, 37.8 ± 5.9% in drums. Daily water temperature ranged 28.00–32.33 °C, salinity 16.00–34.37 ppt. Monthly readings (ppm) of dissolved oxygen ranged 3.1–7.4, sulfide 0.00–0.73, phosphate 0.01–0.87, nitrate 0.00–0.99, nitrite 0.00–0.22, and total suspended solids 0.22–4.83. In April–October 2023, serpulids became prevalent (tubes = 31.5 ± 3.4%; drums = 38.3 ± 3.4%) when mean DO was significantly lower and sulfide higher than in June 2022-March 2023. These fluctuations in water parameters may have triggered the infestation, resulting in lower growth rates and abalone survival. But, despite these fluctuations and infestations, tubes remained a better culture container for the abalone. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",10.1007/s10499-025-01855-7,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218179453

It also evaluated a mark in the shell detected after transferring abalone from the hatchery to the ocean as a predictor of the size-at-release for the abalone. The research was carried out as part of commercial operations on the sea ranch which limited some of the data collected. A total of 117 tagged H. laevigata were released on the Abitats and harvested across three areas (lines). Growth in shell length (SL) was significantly slower on one line (1.96 mm month-1) than the others (2.33 mm month-1 and 2.44 mm month-1), possibly due to different pre-seeding histories. Slower growing abalone were retained in the hatchery for an additional 74 days compared to the faster growing abalone. However, growth in wet weight did not differ significantly among lines (2.22 g month-1). This study provides the first estimates of the different shell-length characteristics for juvenile abalone: the mean (± 1 SE) SL: shell width ratio was 1.31 ± 0.005 and the SL: shell depth ratio was 4.94 ± 0.057, much greater than these ratios for mature H. rubra in southern Australia. The hatchery mark at harvest was a significant linear predictor of the shell length at seeding and was still present in abalone at harvest size (~100 mm SL), providing a way of estimating growth in H. laevigata on the sea ranch without the need for tagging. © Asian Fisheries Society.",10.33997/j.afs.2025.38.1.002,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002373925

Selective breeding serves as an effective strategy to further enhance the yield potential of cultivated organisms. In this study, we report the performance of an abalone strain (HX) that had undergone intensive mass selection for high-yield at one year of age for nine generations. Results showed that seven-month-old juvenile abalone from the HX strain (with a shell length of 34.41 ± 3.70 mm and a wet weight of 5.54 ± 1.56 g) were significantly larger (P < 0.05) than those from the control strain (with a shell length of 27.43 ± 2.56 mm and a wet weight of 2.93 ± 0.79 g). Compared to parental abalones from the control group, the larger parental abalones from the HX strain produced more oocytes with larger yolk, resulting in offspring with a significantly higher (P < 0.05) metamorphosis rate. In terms of artificial feed utilization, juvenile abalone from the HX strain spent significantly more time (P < 0.05) feeding than those from the control strain. Furthermore, the organic matter and protein contents in the mixture of residual feed and feces in the HX strain's cultivating ponds were 25.9 % and 29.3 % lower than those in the control strain, respectively. These findings indicate that abalones from the HX strain not only exhibit improved feed consumption capacity but also possess better nutrient utilization ability. © 2025 The Authors",10.1016/j.aqrep.2025.102766,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000914297

Deltamethrin (DM), a type II pyrethroid insecticide, has been widely detected in coastal and estuarine areas, while little attention has been given to the combined effects of DM and OA. In this study, Haliotis discus hannai was exposed to three pH levels (8.1, 7.7 and 7.4) and three DM nominal concentrations (0 μg/L, 0.6 μg/L and 6 μg/L) for 14 and 28 days. The results indicated that experimental acidification and/or DM exposure led to impaired immune function and pathological damage. Additionally, acidified conditions and DM exposure induced oxidative stress, and gills are more sensitive than digestive glands. With increasing pCO2 and DM nominal concentrations, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased, whereas catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities increased in the gills. Moreover, the expression levels of Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway-related genes were upregulated after exposure. Integrated biomarker response (IBR) analysis proved that acidified conditions and/or DM detrimentally affected the overall fitness of H. discus hannai, and co-exposure to experimental acidification and DM was the most stressful condition. This study emphasizes the necessity of incorporating OA in future pollutant environmental assessments to better elucidate the risks of environmental disturbance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquatox.2024.107139,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85208260233

In this study, AS-stabilized and reinforced carboxymethyl chitosan/collagen/PLGA porous bionic composite scaffolds (AS/CMCS/Col/PLGA) were fabricated through the emulsion polymerization and bionic hybrid technology. As the addition of AS increased from 0.75 to 3.0 wt%, homogeneous distribution of flower-like particles could be observed on the inner surface of the scaffold, and its mechanical properties were improved. Particularly, 3.0 wt% AS-doped scaffolds (S3 and C + S3) exhibited excellent inorganic mineral deposition and osteoblast proliferation and differentiation abilities in vitro. In a SD rat calvarial defect model, they effectively promoted new bone formation in the defect and accelerated expression of osteogenic-angiogenic related proteins (COLI, OCN, VEGF). By virtue of its combined merits including good mechanical properties, inducing mineralization crystallization and facilitating osteogenesis, the 3.0 wt% AS-doped scaffold promises to be employed as a novel bone repair material for bone tissue regeneration. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.135018,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85202841323

However, in the present study, the full-length CDs (Coding sequence) of L-gulonolactone oxidase (GLO) from Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai Ino) were obtained through molecular cloning. The Pacific abalone GLO contained a FAD-binding domain in the N-termination, and ALO domain and conserved HWAK motif in the C-termination. The GLO gene possesses 12 exons and 11 introns. The Pacific abalone GLO was expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, digestive gland, gill, intestine, muscle and mantle. The GLO activity assay revealed that GLO activity was only detected in the kidney of Pacific abalone. After a 100-day feeding trial, dietary AA levels did not significantly affect the survival, weight gain, daily increment in shell length, and feed conversion ratio of Pacific abalone. The expression of GLO in the kidney was downregulated by dietary AA. These results implied that the ability to synthesize AA in abalone had not been lost. From the evolutionary perspective, the loss of GLO occurred independently as an independent event by matching with the genomes of various species. The positive selection analysis revealed that the GLO gene underwent purifying selective pressure during its evolution. In conclusion, the present study provided direct evidence to prove that the GLO activity and the ability to synthesize AA exist in abalone. The AA synthesis ability in vertebrates might have originated from invertebrates dating back 930.31 million years. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.131733,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85190944884

Tularemia in humans is mainly caused by F. tularensis subspecies tularensis and holarctica, but Francisella species like F. novicida, F. philomiragia, F. hispaniensis and others are known to cause tularemia-like infections in immunocompromised humans. In addition to these Francisella species, further genera of the family Francisellaceae have been described, such as Allofrancisella, Parafrancisella and Pseudofrancisella, but less is known about the distribution and putative virulence of these genera. The methods currently available were not made for a fast and easy detection of all these strains and genera of Francisellaceae. Results: We developed a multiplex quantitative real-time PCR assay that can accurately detect all genera of Francisellaceae, including Francisella, Francisella-like endosymbionts, Allofrancisella, Parafrancisella and Pseudofrancisella. In addition, we developed a qPCR assay to differentiate the major clades (B.4, B.6 and B.12 [B.71 and B.72]) of F. tularensis ssp. holarctica strains. Both primer sets were shown to work on isolated DNA out of human and tick samples. Conclusion: Since the developed qPCRs are able to detect all genera of Francisellaceae tested, an easy and fast identification of opportunistic Francisella strains causing tularemia-like symptoms in humans or animals is possible now. The application of these qPCR assays will thus improve the capability for clinical diagnostics and molecular typing during epidemiological investigations. © The Author(s) 2025.",10.1186/s12866-025-03751-9,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216263389

However, mechanical damage caused by ice crystals would lead to quality deterioration. Abalone viscera glycopeptide (AVGP) complex was prepared by hydrolysis technology, which exhibited ice recrystallization ability and antioxidant activity. Moreover, effects of AVGP on Ca2+-ATPase activity, total sulfhydryl content, secondary structure of myofibrillar protein (MP), rheological properties, and gel properties of surimi frozen were investigated. Results showed that surimi treated with AVGP could improve the gel strength and rheological properties of surimi, reduce the gel ice crystal holes, and improve the degradation of gel matrix caused by freeze–thaw. AVGP can significantly inhibit the decrease of Ca2+-ATPase activity and total sulfhydryl group content. When the addition of AVGP exceeded 4% (w/w), its freezing protection effect on MP was better than that of commercial antifreeze agents. Moreover, the α-helix and β-fold contents in the 4% AVGP group were significantly higher than those in the control group, indicating that the addition of an appropriate amount of AVGP can protect the secondary structure of MP. Therefore, AVGP could serve as a new food ingredient with antifreeze and antioxidant functions for frozen surimi. © 2024 The Authors.

Melatonin treatment and irradiation using red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been reported to reduce oxidative stress in a few aquatic organisms. However, the effects of red LED irradiation and melatonin injection on the antioxidant capacity and degree of apoptosis in abalones, which are nocturnal organisms, have not yet been reported. In this study, we compared the expression levels of antioxidant enzymes, total antioxidant capacity, and the degree of apoptosis in abalones subjected to red LED irradiation and melatonin treatment. The results revealed that at high water temperatures (25 °C), the mRNA expression levels of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) genes and the antioxidant activity of SOD decreased in abalones in the red-LED irradiated and melatonin-treated groups compared with those in abalones in the control group. Although high water temperatures induced DNA damage in the abalone samples, the degree of apoptosis was lower in the red-LED irradiated and melatonin-treated groups than in the control group. Overall, the abalones in the melatonin-treated and red-LED irradiated groups showed reduced oxidative stress and increased antioxidant enzyme levels under thermal stress compared with those in the control group. Therefore, red LED irradiation is a promising alternative to melatonin treatment, which is difficult to administer continuously for a long time, for protecting abalones from oxidative stress. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.cbpa.2024.111689,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197048148

Superior hybrids are widely utilized in aquaculture with large benefits. As a typical example, interspecific hybrid “Lvpan” abalone (Haliotis discus hannai ♀ × H. fulgens ♂) also has excellent growth performance, as well as advantaged thermal tolerance. Nevertheless, the mechanisms responsible for this growth heterosis in “Lvpan” hybrid abalone have remained elusive. In this study, a two-month thermostatic acclimation experiment was conducted for “Lvpan” abalone and its parental species at three temperatures (14, 18, and 24 °C). The results showed that the interspecific hybrid ‘Lvpan’ abalone exhibited significant growth heterosis when compared to its parental species, especially at high temperatures. Transcriptome dynamics in the foot muscles of abalones also unveiled that most genes expression patterns represented to be maternal-biased, which are involved in growth-related process. It indicated that maternal effects on gene expression in hybrid abalones play can play an important role in growth heterosis. Moreover, we observed that most genes expressed non-additively in the hybrid abalone are involved in the regulation of growth and cell differentiation during development, which play pivotal roles in the formation of growth heterosis. Consequently, we have provided new insights into abalone interspecific heterosis, emphasizing the pivotal role that non-additive gene expression plays in generating heterosis through cross-breeding. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.741657,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85204590982
Peters H.; Ralph G.M.; Rogers-Bennett L.,Abalones at risk: A global Red List assessment of Haliotis in a changing climate,2024,PLoS ONE,19,12,,,e0309384,"There is increasing awareness that marine invertebrates such as abalones are at risk from the combined stressors of fishing and climate change. Abalones are an important marine fishery resource and of cultural importance to Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. A highly priced marine delicacy, they are inherently vulnerable: individuals are slow-growing and long-lived and successful reproduction requires dense assemblages. However, their global conservation status is poorly understood. Using IUCN Red List methodology, we assessed the extinction risk to all 54 species of abalone (genus Haliotis). Of the 21 fished commercially for human consumption either now and/or in the past, 15 (71.43%) are classified as threatened, i.e., those identified as Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable. Of the 33 unexploited species, only five (15.15%) are so classified, making exploited species over four times more likely to face extinction, underscoring the impact of fishing on abalones already confronting a changing climate. The highest concentration of threatened species occurs along the North American Pacific coast. Here six of the seven species have been exploited, yet despite years of fishery closures with exemptions only in Alaska and Mexico, all are categorised as threatened. Climate driven stressors have led to mass mortalities, with competition from sea urchins and disease, aggravated by harmful algal blooms. In Australia the picture is mixed despite robust stock management, with some regions experiencing mass mortalities from marine heatwaves and viral spread. Poaching has reached its apogee in South Africa, where organised criminal gangs have reduced the legal fishery of Haliotis midae, ‘perlemoen’ almost to a footnote, accompanied by widespread recruitment failure. In response, the authorities have focused on abalone ranching and stock enhancement. In Japan, with a long history of abalone fishing, wild stocks are routinely supplemented with hatchery-bred juveniles. Collaboration between restoration aquaculture and fisheries, including sea urchin control and kelp restoration, offers hope for rebuilding stocks against a backdrop of escalating environmental stressors. © 2024 Peters et al.

This study investigates the feasibility of green technology utilising food waste as a renewable substrate for lactic acid and the resulting residue for subsequent carbon dot production through microbial fermentation and hydrothermal reaction, respectively, while evaluating seashell waste as a replacement for commercial neutralisation reagents. The results demonstrated that seashell waste exhibited effective neutralisation performance during lactic acid fermentation. Within the five types of seashell waste studied, apart from abalone seashells, which led to a significant decrease in lactic acid productivity, all resulted in similar lactic acid fermentations. Additionally, fine powders of seashells were found to be optimal when combined with food waste hydrolysate for lactic acid fermentation. The highest lactic acid productivity of 1.48 g L−1 h−1 obtained in 2 L bioreactor batch fermentation using fine shell powder was 1.64-fold and 0.41-fold higher than those obtained using shell pieces and shell powder, respectively. The results of cell immobilisation fermentation exhibited a superior performance with 2.90 g L−1 h−1 glucose consumption rate and 1.89 g L−1 h−1 lactic acid productivity, which were 1.23-fold and 0.97-fold higher compared to those obtained using NaOH as the neutraliser, respectively. The results of life-cycle assessment also revealed lower environmental impacts associated with lactic acid production using food waste and seashell waste. Cell biomass derived from this study was further utilised to synthesise biomass-derived carbon quantum dots (Bio-CQDs), which demonstrated excellent water solubility, photophysical properties, and potential application as an antibiotic sensor. Overall, the study highlights the potential of seashell waste as an acid neutraliser in lactic acid fermentation and showcases the promising properties of fluorescent Bio-CQDs synthesised from cell biomass, providing valuable insights into the development and implementation of green and sustainable production from waste sources. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",10.1039/d4gc01890g,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197479998
DeSantiago R.; White W.K.; Hyde J.R.; Swiney K.M.; Long J.D.,Consumer- and seaweed-specific impacts of invasion-mediated changes to detrital subsidies on rocky shores,2025,Ecosphere,16,2,,,e70165,"Detrital subsidies such as leaf litter, animal carcasses, and marine wrack can profoundly shape recipient habitats by influencing resiliency and productivity. Species introductions and climate-driven range shifts alter the quantity and quality of these subsidies in donor habitats, thereby potentially influencing recipient communities. Such impacts might be particularly important when detrital shifts alter detritivore feeding and performance. Attempts to identify a general theory predicting the consequences of invasive species on detritivores have been challenging, in part because most theories have been based on the study of microbes or consumers of living prey. Further, two recent meta-analyses disagree about the impacts of invasive plants on detritivore populations. Here, we examined the potential impact of a human-mediated shift in macroalgal detrital subsidy from native giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) to invasive devilweed (Sargassum horneri) on recipient rocky shores, with an emphasis on exploring species-specific impacts. We assessed consumer performance on single species diets or on a mixture in no-choice assays, and we assessed feeding preference in choice assays. Additionally, we examined the impacts of this shift on grazing of native benthic seaweeds by an intertidal consumer assemblage. Replacing native Macrocystis with invasive Sargassum had consumer-specific impacts on performance—suppressing growth of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) but enhancing growth of black turban snails (Tegula funebralis). The effect of mixed diets on consumer growth also displayed consumer specificity. Also, replacing Macrocystis with invasive Sargassum increased grazing of native benthic seaweeds by a realistic detritivore assemblage, but only on the habitat-forming brown seaweed, Silvetia compressa. Thus, invasion-mediated changes in detrital wrack composition had consumer- and seaweed-specific impacts. Such species specificity could underlie disagreements about the impact of species invasions on detritivore populations and could impede our ability to identify a general theory about how species invasions will impact recipient communities via detrital pathways. © 2025 The Author(s).

This study assessed the role of sea cucumber stocking density and frequency of tank cleaning in IMTA on growth, water, and sludge bioremediation. The study was conducted for 16 weeks and was made of four treatments and four replicates; abalone cocultured with sea cucumber (low density—27: 1 g [abalone (ab): sea cucumber (sc)]) with tanks cleaned once a week (L1); abalone cocultured with sea cucumber (low density) with tanks cleaned twice a week (L2); abalone cocultured with sea cucumber (high density—15:1 g [ab:sc]) with tanks cleaned once a week (H1) and abalone cocultured with sea cucumber (high density) with tanks cleaned twice a week (H2). Rearing water nitrite was significantly lower (p = 0.001) at high stocking density of sea cucumbers, but sludge was unaffected. Tanks cleaned once weekly had higher sludge organic matter (p = 0.015) and sludge sulfur content (p = 0.020) and lower sludge carbon (p = 0.003) and nitrogen content (p = 0.049). At the end of the experiment, the stocking density of sea cucumber and frequency of tank cleaning affected abalone mean weight [p = 0.047; p = 0.011, respectively] without a significant interaction (p = 0.517). Abalone in H1 had a higher mean weight and shell length than abalone in L2 and H2 but was similar to those in L1. The stocking density and frequency of cleaning used in this study had no effect on the growth of sea cucumbers [p = 0.150; p = 0.470, respectively]. This study has shown that in an abalone–sea cucumber IMTA system, the stocking density of sea cucumber and the frequency at which tanks are cleaned influence abalone growth and bioremediation of the rearing water. Our result suggests H1 as the best density (ab:sc) and cleaning frequency. The tank cleaning frequency alone affects the tank sludge quality; tanks need not be washed too frequently as, in addition to causing animal stress, cleaning markedly increased carbon and nitrogen level of tank sludge. Both these effects are likely to negatively impact abalone growth. © 2024 The Author(s).

At appropriate concentrations, SeNPs can promote growth, boost immunity, and modulate intestinal microbiota in aquatic animals. However, their effects on the metabolome of aquatic species have not yet been identified. This study evaluated the in vitro effects of our previous synthesized SeNPs, coated with abalone visceral polysaccharide-protein complexes (PSP-SeNPs), on the proliferation of probiotics and common aquatic pathogens, and the in vivo effects on the gut microbiome and metabolome of tilapia. PSP-SeNPs selectively promoted the growth of probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactococcus lactis, while inhibiting the growth of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Aeromonas hydrophila. In the fish breeding experiment, 360 healthy juvenile tilapias (initial weight 1.5 ± 0.5 g/fish) were divided into four groups (3 replicates/group, 30 fish/replicate): group C was fed with basal diet, groups Y, M and H, were fed with the basal diet supplemented with 0.3 mg/kg of Na2SeO3, 0.3 mg/kg of PSP-SeNPs, and 4.5 mg/kg of PSP-SeNPs, respectively. All fish were tested after 7 weeks of breeding in a recirculating aquaculture system. Results showed that group M significantly increased intestinal microbial diversity and potential probiotics (e.g., Cetobacterium, Fimbriiglobus, and Gemmata), while significantly decreased potential pathogens (Plesiomonas, Citrobacter freundii, and Aeromonas hydrophila). Groups H and Y significantly reduced Citrobacter freundii, but both groups decreased gut microbial diversity to varying degrees. Additionally, the pathogenic bacterial genus Plesiomonas significantly increased in group Y. In group M, the growth-promoting intestinal metabolite alpha-tocotrienol was significantly upregulated, whereas some essential amino acids were significantly downregulated in groups Y and H. In summary, 0.3 mg/kg SeNPs supplementation can regulate the intestinal microbiota, while 4.5 mg/kg SeNPs and 0.3 mg/kg Na2SeO3 can cause amino acid metabolism disorders. SeNPs showed higher safety than Na2SeO3. © 2025 The Authors",10.1016/j.aqrep.2025.102627,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214343792

Recently, dietary macro-algae supplementation has gained interest as an promoter of health and growth in abalone. In this study, the effects of three graded levels of dietary protein (35, 41 and 47 %) and 15 % dietary supplementation of dried and ground Ulva lactuca on the digestion and excretion processes in juvenile Australian hybrid abalone (Haliotis rubra x H. laevigata) were investigated through analysis of metabolic oxygen consumption (ṀO) and nitrogen excretion (ṀNH) during meal digestion and assimilation. Trials were conducted at three farm-relevant acclimation temperatures (12, 17 and 22 °C), and abalone acclimated to the highest temperature were additionally subjected to a simulated heatwave. Within the ranges of 35 and 47 % dietary crude protein, no differences were observed in total postprandial energy use, however, significant differences were observed between the three temperatures. Similarly, differences in nitrogen excretion were observed across temperatures but not across dietary protein treatments. Dietary supplementation of U. lactuca led to significantly higher peak and total ṀO throughout the postprandial period at 22 °C. Additionally, total NH4+−N excretion was higher at 17 °C when abalone were fed the U. lactuca supplemented diet. No differences in survival were observed between any of the dietary treatments when juvenile abalone underwent the simulated heatwave, however, the 15 % U. lactuca treatment did exhibit consistently higher ṀO. This information is useful for abalone farmers and feed formulators in developing season-specific diet formulations, particularly regarding macro-algae supplementation. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.741785,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207280472
Devries M.S.; Ly N.; Ebner C.; Hallisey R.,From Individual Calcifiers to Ecosystem Dynamics: Ocean Acidification Effects on Urchins and Abalone,2024,Integrative and Comparative Biology,64,2,290,305,,"A central question in ecology is to what extent do trophic interactions govern the structure and function of com¬munities? This question is becoming more pressing as trophic interactions shift with rapid climate change. Sea urchins and abalone are key invertebrates in the habitats where they reside. Sea urchins are critical members of exemplar trophic cascades in kelp forests due to their impact on kelp establishment and maintenance; yet their populations are controlled by predators, such as sea otters and sunflower sea stars. Abalone compete with urchins for macroalgal food resources and therefore can help regulate urchin populations in kelp forests. Given that both urchin tests and abalone shells used for predator defense are com¬prised of calcium carbonate, much research has been conducted on the impacts of ocean acidification (OA) on these calcified structures. A growing body of literature has shown that urchin tests are less calcified and break with less force under OA condi¬tions. Less is known about abalone, but their shells also appear to respond negatively to OA. Using kelp forest communities as exemplar ecosystems, we discuss the morphological, biomechanical, and physiological responses to OA in urchins and abalone and consider how these individual level responses scale to trophic interactions and ultimately whole ecosystem processes. Al-ell studied, calcified mechanisms for food hus, examining both the feeding and de-though the impacts of OA on the calcified structures used for defense have been w consumption, such as the Aristotle's lantern of urchins, are much less understood, fense sides of trophic interactions would greatly improve our understanding of OA responses across individual to ecosystem scales. More generally, measurements of morphological, biomechanical, and physiological responses to OA can be made in individuals to help predict higher level ecological responses, which would greatly contribute to broader predictions of whole ecosystem responses to OA. ©The Author(s) 2024.",10.1093/icb/icae096,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85203175602

Consequently, the implementation of more osmosis reverse desalination plants in central-northern Chile has been promoted, but the consequences of brine discharges on local organisms are largely unknown. The Chilean abalone (Concholepas concholepas) represent the most economically important marine resource exploited along the Chilean coast. In this study, newly hatched larvae of C. concholepas were used to investigate the effects of brine discharges of a reverse osmosis desalination plant on coastal organisms. Under laboratory conditions, larvae were exposed to various dilutions of a brine to assess the consequences on lethal (survival) and sublethal (swimming performance and metabolism) traits. The results indicated that brine discharges had no effects on larval survival. However, undiluted brines (ca. 56 PSU) and salinities above 38 PSU led to increased metabolic rates and a reduction in the swimming performance of the larvae. We suggest mitigating the negative effects of brines on newly hatched C. concholepas larvae by situating discharge points in highly hydrodynamic zones or as far as possible from mating and larval hatching areas. Additionally, we recommended using diffusers to enhance mixing and dilute brine to sub-lethal levels (below 48 PSU). © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.desal.2024.117579,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85189678650

This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying shell colour formation, with a focus on the roles of biomineralisation, photosensitivity, and stress resistance. Using transcriptome analysis and microstructural observations, we compared red-shelled (RS) and green-shelled (GS) variants to identify key genes and pathways associated with shell colour. The results reveal that GS variants exhibit higher expression of visual protein genes (e.g., RHO-opnGq), which are linked to light sensitivity and pigment synthesis. Additionally, RS variants show upregulated chitin biosynthesis genes (e.g., CHs-IA), potentially influencing shell structure and pigmentation. These findings suggest that these genes play a critical role in regulating pigment deposition and shell colour formation, while biomineralisation genes contribute to shell integrity. This study provides new insights into the genetic basis of shell colour variation and its ecological significance, offering valuable information for selective breeding programs. © 2025",10.1016/j.cbd.2025.101461,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219744022

Due to their potential to flocculate and deposit when interacting with high ionic strength media, GO poses a threat, especially to benthic organisms like polychaetes. In addition to chemical contamination, estuaries also face a severe threat from invasive species, which can cause irreversible damage to ecosystems. The combination of abiotic and biotic stressors may work together on native species, decreasing their resilience. Thus, this study aims to assess the effects of an abiotic stressor, GO nanosheets (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 mg GO/Kg dw) on Hediste diversicolor (native species) and Arenicola marina (invasive species) through several behavioral assays and biochemical markers. The impact of invasive species A. marina (biotic factor) on H. diversicolor avoidance behavior was also evaluated. Obtained results demonstrated that H. diversicolor fled from lower GO contamination compartments to higher ones and that exposure to increased GO concentrations negatively impacted its burrowing activity. They were unable to escape from higher contamination compartments, but at the highest concentrations, the bioturbation activity was significantly higher, which may indicate that H. diversicolor tended to dwell deeper in the sediment. A. marina showed an escape behavior from compartments with higher GO concentrations. Additionally, this species' bioturbation activity significantly decreased when exposed to GO. Moreover, avoidance tests demonstrated that the presence of A. marina affected the behavior of H. diversicolor. Regarding oxidative stress, H. diversicolor seems to be more impacted than A. marina, since Lipid peroxidation levels were higher in all GO concentrations and Superoxide dismutase activity significantly increased in the lowest GO levels. Overall, H. diversicolor spatial distribution may be severely constrained under abiotic and biotic stress, while A. marina's higher foraging activity may promote its propagation in the estuary. Behavioral tests, combined with biochemical markers have shown to be relevant tools for the development of more environmental-realistic assessment and monitoring frameworks for estuaries. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.marenvres.2024.106821,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207814315

As the wild resources of Pacific abalone are on the verge of exhaustion, efforts to reveal the effects of predation by hostile organisms on the efficiency of its bottom sowing and proliferation are crucial for the success of resource restoration. In this study, abalone and its predator, starfish Asterias amurensis, were placed in a customized monitoring unit. Through continuous infrared video monitoring, predation pressure was found to cause a significant decrease in the distance moved, duration of movement, cumulative feeding duration and orexin levels in hemolymph (P < 0.01). It also caused a significant increase in the average velocity of movement, group cohesion, coordination and cholecystokinin levels in hemolymph (P < 0.01). Surprisingly, when a shelter was set up in the environment, the cumulative feeding duration of abalone was significantly extended in the presence of the predator (P < 0.001), whereas when the predator was removed, the distance moved, duration of movement, and cumulative feeding duration of abalone were found to significantly increase during continuous 24 h monitoring (P < 0.01). These results first identified the anti-predation strategy by nocturnal marine organisms when exposed to predation risk, and supported the pivotal role of shelter in helping abalone make a trade-off between predation pressure and survival needs, which not only provides a new insight to optimizing the strategy for prevention and control of marine ecological disasters and strengthening the protection of marine endangered species, but also results in a productive attempt to restore the marine benthic ecosystem. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.applanim.2024.106265,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191170286

The results showed that the weight gain rate of abalones in the groups with 0.53% and 1.24% of dietary Hyp were significantly higher than that in the group with 0.05% dietary Hyp. The 0.53% and 1.24% of dietary Hyp significantly increased lysyl hydroxylase and prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity and pyridinium crosslink content, and up-regulated collagen biosynthesis-related gene expression in abalone muscle. Meanwhile, dietary Hyp supplementation significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of mmp-1 and significantly up-regulated the mRNA expression of timp. During the same storage time, the springiness, hardness and water-holding capacity of muscle in the dietary Hyp supplementation treatments were significantly higher. The muscle hardness in the dietary Hyp supplementation groups on day 6 was higher than that in the control group on day 3. Meanwhile, dietary Hyp significantly decreased the content of carbonyl and malonaldehyde, as well as the activity of cathepsin B and cathepsin L in the muscle of abalone during the storage. In conclusion, dietary Hyp supplementation increased collagen content, improved texture and extended the shelf life of abalone. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.741082,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85192903876

Subtidal, adult pāua experience irregular food supply. The effects of prolonged starvation have not been examined. Aim. To examine effects of 105-day starvation on body mass, respiration and haemolymph proteins. Methods. Pāua, maintained at 15°C, were divided into groups that were either fed Macrocystis pyrifera, or starved; each group was further divided between pāua whose haemolymph was sampled at intervals and those sampled only at the beginning and end of the experimental period. Body mass, condition, oxygen uptake and gonad index were measured at the start and end. Key results. Total mass of both fed and starved groups did not change significantly. The condition of the starved individuals decreased significantly. Haemocyanin accounts almost entirely for haemolymph proteins. The haemolymph haemocyanin concentration in fed abalone fell by 17–27% over 105 days, and by 49–63% in starved individuals. Final normoxic oxygen uptake was similar in starved and fed pāua and declined similarly during hypoxia. Conclusions. Pāua may survive extended periods of starvation by metabolising body tissues and haemocyanin, with only minor changes in their mass, condition and aerobic respiration. Implications. These primitive gastropods have mechanisms to survive stressors associated with low food availability.

Choi M.-J.; Oh Y.D.; Chung J.S.; Lim H.K.,Palliative effect of abalone insulin-related peptide 2 on emersion stress-induced hyperglycemia in the Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai),2024,Aquaculture,592,,,,741161,"The Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), an economically important marine mollusk in East Asia, is often exposed to extreme environments, such as high water temperatures during summer and air exposure during handling or transportation. These stressful conditions lead to hyperglycemia and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in oxidative stress and subsequent cell damage in the organism. To understand the role of insulin-related peptides in the regulation of elevated hemolymph glucose, hyperglycemia was confirmed in abalone under high water temperature and air (emersion) exposure (p < 0.05). To prove the existence of a glucose regulatory system in abalone, changes in hemolymph glucose were measured after bovine insulin injection, and hemolymph glucose was lowered by bovine insulin injection in hyperglycemia caused by both stressors (p < 0.05), supporting the existence of a glucose regulatory system functionally similar to that of vertebrates. Among the three abalone insulin-related peptides (AIPs), which were previously reported to be upregulated along with hemolymph glucose levels upon feeding, the relative mRNA expression of AIP2 in the cerebral ganglion showed a close correlation with high water temperature and emersion stress, which peaked 12 h after treatment (p < 0.05). Based on these results, we focused on the function of AIP2 in glucose homeostasis and characterized the localization of AIP2 mRNA-expressing cells in the cerebral ganglion using in situ hybridization. Positive signals from RNA probes were detected in neural cortex cells in the cerebral ganglion. Furthermore, suppressing AIP2 mRNA expression using RNA interference with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) revealed that dsRNA-AIP2 injected abalone maintained high hemolymph glucose levels after 24 h of recovery following 1 h of emersion stress (p < 0.01). In contrast, abalones that received dsRNA-GFP and molluscan saline showed relatively rapid clearance of hemolymph glucose. This study demonstrates that AIP2 gene expression affects the recovery rate from emersion stress-induced hyperglycemia by regulating hemolymph glucose. © 2024",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.741161,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85195319856

Abalones were subjected to varying Cd concentrations for one and two months. While one-month exposure yielded no significant mortality, prolonged exposure to high Cd concentrations for two months substantially elevated mortality risk (hazard ratio = 3.359). Integrated biomarker response values exhibited progressive elevation with both concentration and exposure duration, indicating cumulative perturbation of antioxidant defense and metabolic enzyme systems. Metabolomic analysis revealed distinct temporal and concentration-dependent responses. After one month of exposure, medium concentrations predominantly affected energy and amino acid metabolism with a shift toward anaerobic pathways, while high concentrations activated additional detoxification and stress response mechanisms; after two months of exposure, divergent metabolic strategies emerged, where low concentrations induced lipid remodeling, medium concentrations maintained basic metabolic adjustments, while high concentrations precipitated comprehensive cellular dysfunction. Notably, the observed metabolic focusing at two months represented a forced trade-off under allostatic overload rather than successful adaptation, particularly in high-concentration groups. Combined analysis demonstrated fundamental reorganization of cellular metabolism under prolonged exposure. These findings emphasize the importance of long-term, multi-parameter assessments in evaluating marine ecotoxicological impacts of metal pollution. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2025.137578,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217549086

Results showed that Sahlingia subintegra induced significantly higher settlement rates (58.17 ± 12.71%) compared to CCA, Ulvella leptochaete and Rhodosorus marinus. In all treatments, post-larvae were weekly fed a mix of diatoms (Amphora sp., and Navicula incerta).

However, at four and five weeks post settlement there were no significant differences in post-larval shell length and growth rates between CCA and Sahlingia subintegra substrates.

Ballistic tests demonstrated that, when subjected to Type 53 API bullet impact at velocities ranging from 780 to 815 m/s, the layered-and-staggered concrete outperformed both steel fiber reinforced bulk concrete and simple layered concrete with comparable compressive strengths in terms of reducing bullet penetration depth. Furthermore, damage in the layered-and-staggered concrete was primarily confined to areas surrounding directly impacted tiles or joints; cracks on the impact face did not propagate radially as observed in bulk concrete but instead deflected along weak interfaces between adjacent tiles. Additionally, crack deflection and bullet yawing were observed in the thickness direction of the layered-and-staggered concrete targets, aligning with expectations for bionic design effects. Incorporating steel micro-fibers into the layered-and-staggered system enhanced individual tile's impact resistance but did not reduce bullet penetration depth.

With a 3 × 2 factorial design, three levels of dietary lipid (1.59 %, 3.95 % and 6.83 %, respectively) and two water temperatures (17 °C and 23 °C) were set. After a 100-day feeding trial, results showed that compared with 6.83 % and 1.59 %, 3.95 % of dietary lipid significantly increased the weight gain ratio (WGR) and daily increment in shell length (DISL) of abalone. Compared with 17 °C, 23 °C of water temperature increased WGR of abalone. Both of dietary lipid level and water temperature play main effects on WGR and a significant interaction was observed. Dietary lipid level plays a main effect on DISL. 3.95 % of dietary lipid level significantly increased trypsin activities in intestine under two water temperatures. Compared with 17 °C, 23 °C of water temperature significantly increased the activities of trypsin and Na+-K+-ATPase in intestine of abalone in 1.59 % of dietary lipid level. Dietary lipid level plays a main effect on trypsin activity. Water temperature plays a main effect on activities of trypsin, amylase and Na+-K+-ATPase. The 6.83 % of dietary lipid level decreased survival and cumulative mortality after Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection. Compared with 17 °C, 23 °C of water temperature significantly decreased survival and increased cumulative mortality, where both dietary lipid level and water temperature play a main effect. 6.83 % of dietary lipid level significantly decreased respiratory burst activity, blood cell count and acid phosphatase activity. Compared with 23 °C, 17 °C of water temperature significantly increased respiratory burst activity, blood cell count, activities of lysozyme and acid phosphatase. Dietary lipid level significantly affected respiratory burst activity, blood cell count and acid phosphatase activity. Water temperature significantly affected respiratory burst activity, blood cell count and activities of lysozyme and acid phosphatase, and a significant interaction between dietary lipid level and water temperature on respiratory burst activity and blood cell count was observed. The 6.83 % dietary lipid level up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines expression which was associated with Perilipin2/TLR-s/MyD88/IRAK4/(NF-κB or AP-1) signaling, down-regulated relative gene expression of anti-oxidative enzymes which was related to Keap1/Nrf-2 signaling, up-regulated caspase-3 and caspase-7 expression which was related to JNK/(Bcl2 and Bax) signaling, down-regulated ATG101, Beclin-1 and LC3 expression and decreased LONP, HSP70 and HSP90 expression which was related to HSF-1/Sirt3 signaling. Compared with 17 °C, 23 °C of water temperature up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines expression which was related to activating Perilipin2/(NF-κB or AP-1) signaling, down-regulated mRNA levels of anti-oxidative enzymes which was related to inhibiting Keap1/Nrf-2 signaling, up-regulated caspase-3 expression which was related to Bcl2/Bax signaling, down-regulated ATG101, Beclin-1 and LC3 expression, down-regulated expression of LONP, HSP70 and HSP90 which was related to inhibiting HSF-1/Sirt signaling. Taken together, 3.95 % of dietary lipid level at 23 °C of water temperature increased growth performance and decreased immune function of abalone, while 3.95 % of dietary lipid level at 17 °C showed the opposite trend. It is suggested that when the lipid level (3.95 %) in diet is appropriate, a relatively lower water temperature (17 °C) is more suitable for the health of Pacific abalone H. discus hannai. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.742013,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212160862
Yao T.; Tan J.; Lu J.; Fu S.; Xie Z.; Li B.; Cheng C.; Ye L.,Deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 (DMBT1) gene relate to immune priming and phagocytosis modulation in the small abalone Haliotis diversicolor,2025,Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part - C: Toxicology and Pharmacology,290,,,,110126,"The small abalone (Haliotis diversicolor) is an economic shellfish cultured in the south coast of China. In recent years, the frequent occurrence of the disease has led to significant mortality in abalone farms. Deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 (DMBT1), a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) protein family, plays an important role in host defense. However, its function in H. diversicolor remains unknown. In order to evaluate the immune priming effect after secondary infection and elucidate possible regulatory mechanism, a novel DMBT1 from the small abalone H. diversicolor (designated as HdDMBT1) was cloned and characterized in this study. The open reading frame of HdDMBT1 was 2331 bp encoding 776 amino acids with a molecular weight of 84.73 kDa. HdDMBT1 contained conserved active sites with DMBT1 from other species, detected in all tested tissues and had higher expression levels in hepatopancreas. The temporal expression profiles of HdDMBT1 after two challenges of Vibrio harveyi were examined to evaluate priming response in the small abalone. The expression level of HdDMBT1 mRNA in hepatopancreas increased significantly after V. harveyi challenge. Meanwhile, the expression level of HdDMBT1 after the second challenge was significantly higher than that after the first challenge (4.23-fold). RNA interference (RNAi) experiments were conducted to examine the role of HdDMBT1 in response to V. harveyi infection. Knocking down HdDMBT1 decreased the hemocytes phagocytosis (0.48-fold). In addition, the bacterial density in hemolymph and the mortality of abalone raised, when infected with V. harveyi after dsHdDMBT1 injection. These results indicated that HdDMBT1 might play an important role in tolerance to bacterial infection. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.cbpc.2025.110126,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215607278

The Puget Sound Restoration Fund, in collaboration with state and federal agencies, has been outplanting juvenile pinto abalone at sites in the San Juan Archipelago, and some sites are much more successful than others despite similar physical characteristics. The sites, however, likely differ in oceanic parameters, such as temperature, salinity, and pH, which are in turn changing as the climate of the Earth is changing. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of temperature fluctuation and pCO2levels on the survival, growth, and oxygen consumption of juvenile pinto abalone. In a fully crossed experiment, juvenile pinto abalone were held at either currently ambient (400 ppm) or elevated (1,200 ppm) pCO2and at constant (10°C) or fluctuating (10 → 14 → 10°C) temperature. Survival was monitored weekly and growth was measured after 4 wk. In a second experiment, abalone were held in the same crossed pCO2and temperature treatments, and oxygen consumption was measured. High pCO2and fluctuating temperature both significantly decreased abalone survival. Abalone growth was not affected by pCO2level (temperature could not be analyzed due to very poor survival in the fluctuating temperature treatments). In addition, there was an interaction between fluctuating temperature and pCO2level on abalone oxygen consumption. Abalone in the constant temperature treatment had higher oxygen consumption when exposed to elevated pCO2; however, this pattern was not observed in the fluctuating temperature treatment. The results of this experiment indicate that outplant sites with minimal temperature fluctuation and lower pCO2levels could lead to improvements in outplanting success of juvenile pinto abalone. © 2024 National Shellfisheries Association.

Zhang J.; Wang Y.; Gan Y.; Hong J.; Ke J.; You W.; Chen Y.; Luo X.; Ke C.,Changes in water temperature: The effect of triploid performance in Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai),2024,Aquaculture,585,,,,740701,"The triploid Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) has significant economic value and promising application prospects. However, the optimal cultural conditions that maximize the advantages of triploidy in the abalone have yet to be determined. This study examined the properties of triploid Pacific abalone after 3 months of culture under three constant temperatures (18 °C, 22 °C, and 26 °C) to fill up this information gap. The results showed that the survival rate of triploids in the 26 °C group was significantly higher than that of diploids (P < 0.05), while the survival rate of triploids in the other two groups was similar to that of diploids (P > 0.05). Except for the shell width of the 22 °C group and the shell length of the 26 °C group, triploid Pacific abalone exhibited significantly superior growth traits compared to diploids at all temperatures (P < 0.05). The most notable improvement was observed in the foot muscle weight trait, where there were triploid advantage rates of 81.44% (18 °C), 76.21% (22 °C), and 54.96% (26 °C). The specific growth rate and the ratio of shell length and body weight indicated that triploids grew the fastest in the 22 °C group. Furthermore, the thermal resistance of diploids and triploids was evaluated through the Arrhenius break temperature (ABT) of cardiac performance. The results demonstrated that the ABT of triploids was significantly higher than that of diploids (P < 0.05, ABT2N = 30.81 ± 0.43 °C, ABT3N = 31.38 ± 0.72 °C). Both diploid and triploid foot adhesion forces were measured, and the results showed that triploid foot adhesion force was stronger than that of diploids (P < 0.05). Additionally, there was a significant positive correlation between foot adhesion force and meat yield traits (foot muscle weight, fullness index (FI) and foot muscle-soft tissue index (FMSI)) (P < 0.05). In summary, this study confirmed the triploid advantage in meat yield of Pacific abalone and identified a temperature range that maximizes their growth rate. Moreover, triploids exhibited improved thermal resistance and adhesion capacity compared to diploids, with an increase in meat yield. The results of this study could serve as a reference for identifying a culture model suitable for triploid Pacific abalone and thus could promote the development of the triploid aquaculture industry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.740701,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85186751456

However, overexploitation of abalone, conch, topshell, and limpets has resulted in population declines globally, with numerous species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Various efforts to supplement existing populations by either translocating wild or releasing hatchery-produced stock have suffered from low survival. To understand predictors influencing post-release survival, we conducted a systematic review and quantitative synthesis of literature on marine gastropod releases. Our global review identified 88 studies (575 unique release events) across 18 species. A similar number of releases were conducted in tropical (52 %) and temperate (48 %) regions, although most release events involved either Haliotidae (57 %) or Strombidae (26 %). Most releases used hatchery-produced stock (77 %), highlighting the prominent role of aquaculture. For seven species with sufficient data, we tested the effect of time since release, stock origin (hatchery, translocated), size at release, and density on post-release apparent survival (referred to as ‘survival’ hereafter), where applicable. Survival declined through time regardless of species. Hatchery-produced and translocated Haliotis fulgens had similar survival post-release, but hatchery-produced Aliger gigas had lower survival probability than translocated stock. Size at release increased survival probability for only two (Haliotis discus and A. gigas) of the seven species. Similarly, density had no effect on the post-release survival of Haliotis rubra, Haliotis rufescens, and A. gigas. Overall, we found low long-term predicted survival across the seven species. Our findings highlight that overcoming low post-release survival is a significant hurdle when rehabilitating depleted stocks of marine gastropods. © 2025 The Authors",10.1016/j.biocon.2025.111153,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002139966

Here, Haliotis fulgens juveniles were fed with four macralgae Ulva lactuca, Eisenia arborea, Macrocystis pyrifera, Gelidium robustum, and a seagrass (Phyllospadix torreyi) for 174 days and lipid composition was analysed in digestive gland and muscle. Better growth for juveniles fed M. pyrifera or E. arborea was observed, and survival was higher for juveniles fed E. arborea. Cholesterol is either synthesized de novo, or transformed from other phytosterols in abalone; several phystosterols were associated with survival. Highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA), and particularly docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3 or DHA) were found in tissues of juveniles fed E. arborea, that did not contain these HUFA. DHA in muscle phospholipids and several bacteria biomarkers in digestive gland (15:0, 17:0, and branched fatty acids) were negatively associated with growth. Survival was associated with 16:2n-4, a biomarker for diatoms, and iso18:0 a biomarker for mainly gut bacteria. Non-methylene interrupted fatty acids (NMI) were highest in abalone fed U. lactuca, in agreement with the capacity of molluscs to produce NMI when lacking HUFA. Finally, abalone survived for two months without any feed, so feeding experiments should last at least double that time. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",10.1007/s10499-025-01977-y,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003941669

Abalone requires bacterial extracellular enzymes to aid the digestive process by breaking down complex macromolecules. This study aims to determine the ability of Bacillus from abalone to hydrolyze complex macromolecules, antibacterial activities against pathogenic Vibrios and to select Bacillus that has the potential as a probiotic candidate. Test the ability of Bacillus to hydrolyze several complex compounds such as agar, fat,protein, and starch using SWC agar media which has been enriched by the substrate to be hydrolyzed. Hydrolysis test data were obtained from 2 methods, namely by observing the clear zone using cell culture and the clear zone formed from the cell-free supernatant containing the crude extract of the enzyme. The clear zone formed becomes an indicator of Bacillus capable of hydrolyzing complex compounds. The datawere analyzed descriptively through a semi-quantitative potency test. Test the ability of Bacillus isolates in inhibiting the growth of Vibrio sp. carried out by the well-diffusion method.The results showed that Bacillus SL1K1 was the best at hydrolyzing starch and agar with a starch hydrolysis index of 2.25 and a agar hydrolysis index of 4.73. Isolate Bacillus SL2K2 was the best at hydrolyzing lipids with a lipid hydrolysis index of 1.27, isolate Bacillus CA2K6 was the best at hydrolyzing proteins with a proteinhydrolysis index of 3.13. The enzymatic ability of Bacillus based on the clear zone formed showed that Bacillus SL1K1 isolate was the best at hydrolyzing agar-agar and starch. The antibacterial test results of the four isolates of Bacillus against Vibrio bacteria showed that the isolate of Bacillus CAK1 against Vibrio parahaemolyticus had the highest activity with an average inhibition zone of 14.5 mm. Thus, both Bacillus SLK1 and CAK1 isolates have the potential to be used as probiotic candidates. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc..

In Pacific oysters, the inheritance patterns of several shell colors have been investigated, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms of melanogenesis and pigmentation. cAMP-response element binding proteins (CREB) are important transcription factors in the cAMP-mediated melanogenesis pathway. In this study, we characterized two CREB genes (CREB3L2 and CREB3L3) from Pacific oysters. Both of them contained a conserved DNA-binding and dimerization domain (a basic-leucine zipper domain). CREB3L2 and CREB3L3 were expressed highly in the mantle tissues and exhibited higher expression levels in the black-shell oyster than in the white. Masson-Fontana melanin staining and immunofluorescence analysis showed that the location of CREB3L2 protein was generally consistent with the distribution of melanin in oyster edge mantle. Dual-luciferase reporter assays revealed that CREB3L2 and CREB3L3 could activate the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) promoter and this process was regulated by the level of cAMP. Additionally, we found that cAMP regulated melanogenic gene expression through the CREB-MITF-TYR axis. These results implied that CREB3L2 and CREB3L3 play important roles in melanin synthesis and pigmentation in Pacific oysters. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.cbpb.2024.110970,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85189917971

However, there is very limited research on Elovl in abalone. In this study, an elongase gene encoding 303 amino acids was found to exhibit higher homology with the Elovl2/5 sequences of mollusks (60 %) than the Elovl5 of fish and mammals (about 43.30 %). Heterologous expression in yeast showed that abalone Elovl could efficiently catalyze the extension of C18:3n-3, C18:3n-6 and C18:4n-3, moderately elongate C18:2n-6, C20:4n-6 and C20:5n-3 to corresponding products. However, it has extremely weak ability to extend C20:3n-6 and C20:4n-3 and no affinity for C22 PUFA. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the sequence of abalone Elovl is closely related to Elovl2/5 of the cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) and octopus (Octopus vulgaris). Tissue distribution revealed that the Elovl was highly expressed in female and male gonads, moderately in hepatopancreas, and minimally in other tested tissues. The expression levels of Elovl in hepatopancreas of abalone fed 50 % FO and 75 % FO diets were significantly higher than that in the 100 % FO control group. And no significant differences were found in the expressions of 0 % FO, 25 % FO and control groups. The EPA in 75 % FO group is significantly higher than those of other groups. This study provides the first systematic characterization of the dual substrate specificity of Elovl in abalone, bridging a critical knowledge gap in the evolutionary and functional investigation of elongases within gastropods. © 2025 The Authors",10.1016/j.aqrep.2025.102860,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105005571923

Tuberculata Chang (Camellia L.): genomic features, comparative analysis, and phylogenetic relationships",2024,BMC Genomics,25,1,,,108,"Background: Sect. Tuberculata belongs to Camellia, and its members are characterized by a wrinkled pericarp and united filaments. All the plants in this group, which are endemic to China, are highly valuable for exploring the evolution of Camellia and have great potential for use as an oil source. However, due to the complex and diverse phenotypes of these species and the difficulty of investigating them in the field, their complex evolutionary history and interspecific definitions have remained largely unelucidated. Results: Therefore, we newly sequenced and annotated 12 chloroplast (cp) genomes and retrieved the published cp genome of Camellia anlungensis Chang in sect. Tuberculata. In this study, comparative analysis of the cp genomes of the thirteen sect. Tuberculata species revealed a typical quadripartite structure characterized by a total sequence length ranging from 156,587 bp to 157,068 bp. The cp.genome arrangement is highly conserved and moderately differentiated. A total of 130 to 136 genes specific to the three types were identified by annotation, including protein-coding genes (coding sequences (CDSs)) (87–91), tRNA genes (35–37), and rRNA genes (8). The total observed frequency ranged from 23,045 (C. lipingensis) to 26,557 (C. anlungensis). IR region boundaries were analyzed to show that the ycf1 gene of C. anlungensis is located in the IRb region, while the remaining species are present only in the IRa region. Sequence variation in the SSC region is greater than that in the IR region, and most protein-coding genes have high codon preferences. Comparative analyses revealed six hotspot regions (tRNA-Thr(GGT)-psbD, psbE-petL, ycf15-tRNA-Leu(CAA), ndhF-rpl32, ndhD, and trnL(CAA)-ycf15) in the cp genomes that could serve as potential molecular markers. In addition, the results of phylogenetic tree construction based on the cp genomes showed that the thirteen sect. Tuberculata species formed a monophyletic group and were divided into two evolutionarily independent clades, confirming the independence of the section. Conclusions: In summary, we obtained the cp genomes of thirteen sect. Tuberculata plants and performed the first comparative analysis of this group. These results will help us better characterize the plants in this section, deepen our understanding of their genetic characteristics and phylogenetic relationships, and lay the theoretical foundation for their accurate classification, elucidation of their evolutionary changes, and rational development and utilization of this section in the future. © 2024, The Author(s).",10.1186/s12864-024-09982-w,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85182998190

This study investigated the dynamic characteristics of non-volatile compounds over a year, including metabolites, lipids, nucleotides, and free amino acids (FAAs), which determined the nutritional quality and flavor of abalone. 174 metabolites and 371 lipids were identified and characterized, while 20 FAAs and 11 nucleotides were quantitatively assessed. These non-volatile compounds of abalone were fluctuated with months variation, which was consistent with the fluctuations of environmental factors, especially seawater temperature. Compared with seasonal variation, gender had less influence on these non-volatiles. June and July proved to be the optimal harvesting periods for abalone, with the levels of overall metabolites, lipids, FAAs, and nucleotides in abalone exhibiting a higher value in June and July over a year. Intriguingly, taurine covered 60% of the total FAAs and abalone could be used as dietary taurine supplementation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.foodchem.2024.139197,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85189692044

However, the functional properties of these proteins are yet to be comprehensively characterized in most marine invertebrates. In this study, we identified and characterized an MT homolog from the disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus), referred to as disk abalone MT (AbMT). AbMT exhibited the same primary structural features as MTs from other mollusks containing two β-domains (β2β1-form). AbMT protein demonstrated metal-binding and detoxification abilities against Zn, Cu, and Cd, as evidenced by Escherichia coli growth kinetics, metal tolerance analysis, and UV absorption spectrum. Transcriptional analysis revealed that AbMT was ubiquitously expressed in all analyzed tissues and upregulated in gill tissue following challenge with Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes, and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). Additionally, overexpression of AbMT suppressed LPS-induced NO production in RAW264.7 macrophages, protected cells against H2O2-induced oxidative stress, and promoted macrophage polarization toward the M1 phase. Conclusively, these findings suggest an important role for AbMT in environmental stress protection and immune regulation in disk abalone. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.fsi.2024.109645,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85193818433

Five isonitrogenous and isolipic (about 33% crude protein and 3% crude lipid) practical diets were formulated to fed abalones (initial body weight: 25.82 ± 0.51 g; initial mean shell length: 59.57 ± 0.40 mm). Results showed that 0.98–2.19 dietary EPA/DHA ratio significantly increased abalone's weight gain rate (WGR) and daily increment in shell length (DISL). As for the intestine enzyme activity, trypsin activity was significantly higher when 0.55 EPA/DHA ratio was applied to the diet. The lipase activity in the groups with 0.98 and 0.55 dietary EPA/DHA ratio was significantly higher than those in other groups. And 1.59 dietary EPA/DHA ratio significantly increased α-amylase activity. In regard to the intestinal microbiota, the 0.98 dietary EPA/DHA ratio significantly increased the diversity indices and number of OTUs in the intestine, followed by the 2.19 dietary EPA/DHA ratio. At the phyla level, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacterioidota and Actinobacteria were dominant in all groups. The Mycoplasma was the most prevalent genus among all the groups. The highest abundance of Clostridium_sensu_stricto_11, Mycobacterium and Bacteroides belonged to the group with the 0.38 dietary EPA/DHA ratio. The abundance of Bacilli, Terasakiellacease and Ahrensia in 0.38 group were higher than that in the group with 0.98 and 2.19 dietary EPA/DHA ratio. Moreover, 1.59 dietary EPA/DHA ratio significantly reduced the falling rate of abalone after heat stress. And the hsp70 and hsp90 mRNA expression levels in the digestive gland were up-regulated significantly in the group with the 2.19 dietary EPA/DHA ratio. The 0.98 dietary EPA/DHA ratio could increase the content of malondialdehyde in cell-free hemolymph and the expressions of tnfa and nrf2 in digestive gland. In conclusion, the optimal dietary EPA/DHA ratio for abalone was estimated to be 1.63 using a second-order quadratic regression based on WGR. The 1.59–2.19 dietary EPA/DHA ratio could increase the immunity and resistance of abalone against heat stress. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.aqrep.2024.102085,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191145589

Changes in messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of melatonin receptor (MT-R), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and antioxidant enzymes, as well as alterations in H2O2 levels in the hemolymph, were examined. The results revealed that high-temperature-stressed abalones treated with melatonin injections or exposed to red LED light showed a significant increase in MT-R mRNA expression, while HSP70 mRNA expression decreased. Notably, HSP70 mRNA expression levels in the red LED light-irradiated group were similar to those in the group injected with 10−8M melatonin after 24 h exposure. Abalones treated with melatonin at 20°C or irradiated with red LED light exhibited decreased H2O2 levels and reduced antioxidant enzyme mRNA expression compared with those of the control group. However, the high-temperature environment induced oxidative stress in abalones, leading to increased antioxidant enzyme mRNA expression compared with that under 20°C conditions. Moreover, abalones exposed to high-temperature stress exhibited hepatopancreatic DNA damage, which was attenuated by melatonin treatment or red LED light irradiation. Hence, red LED light reduces oxidative stress, boosts antioxidant enzymes, and alleviates DNA damage in high-temperature-stressed abalones, akin to 10−8M melatonin treatment. Therefore, considering the practical challenges of continuous melatonin administration to abalones, utilizing red LED light emerges as a practical, effective alternative to protect abalones from oxidative stress compared to 10−8M melatonin treatment. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",10.1002/jez.2800,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85185919435
Zhang M.; Gao X.; Meenu M.; Liu Y.,Functional analysis of retinal-binding protein in the visual system of the nocturnal marine shellfish Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai),2025,International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,306,,,,141529,"The Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) is a nocturnal species that inhabits marine benthic ecosystems, characterized by its aversion to light and preference for darkness during daylight hours, with movement and feeding predominantly occurring at night. However, the morphology and structure of its visual organs and the mechanisms underlying its perception of cyclical light variations are unknown. This study analyzed the Retinal-binding protein (RALBP) gene to elucidate its role in the abalone's visual system. Using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique, the RALBP gene was cloned, revealing an open reading frame (ORF) of 1188 bp encoding 396 amino acids. A recombinant expression vector was subsequently constructed to produce a recombinant protein with a molecular weight of 45.3 kDa. This purified recombinant protein was used as an antigen to generate a polyclonal antibody, with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results indicating an antibody potency of ≥512 K. Immunofluorescence assays demonstrated strong RALBP signals in the pigment epithelial and photoreceptor cell layers of the retina, with no detection in other retinal layers. To evaluate circadian expression patterns of RALBP under different light spectra, including full-spectrum natural light, short-wavelength blue light (450 nm), and long-wavelength orange light (560 nm), western blotting and the Cosinor program were utilized. The results revealed significant cosine rhythmic expression of RALBP under all light conditions (P < 0.05), with higher expression levels during the day compared to the night (P < 0.05). This is the first study that provides insights into the morphological and structural characteristics of the abalone retina and demonstrates that the abalone's ability to detect cyclical light changes is determined by the diurnal expression of RALBP. These findings establish a theoretical basis for understanding the evolution of visual organs and circadian regulation mechanisms in marine shellfish. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2025.141529,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219117983

In the present study, a macin was cloned and characterized from Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai (Designated as HdMac). Analysis of the conserved domain suggested that HdMac was a new member of the macin family. In non-stimulated abalones, HdMac transcripts were constitutively expressed in all five tested tissues, especially in hemocytes. After Vibrio harveyi stimulation, the expression of HdMac mRNA in hemocytes was significantly up-regulated at 12 hr (P < 0.01). RNAi-mediated knockdown of HdMac transcripts affected the survival rates of abalone against V. harveyi. Moreover, recombinant protein of HdMac (rHdMac) exhibited high antibacterial activities against invading bacteria, especially for Vibrio anguillarum. In addition, rHdMac possessed binding activities towards glucan, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and peptidoglycan (PGN), but not chitin in vitro. Membrane integrity analysis revealed that rHdMac could increase the membrane permeability of bacteria. Meanwhile, both the phagocytosis and chemotaxis ability of hemocytes could be significantly enhanced by rHdMac. Overall, the results showed that HdMac could function as a versatile molecule involved in immune responses of H. discus hannai. © 2024",10.1016/j.jip.2024.108113,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85190529913

Between them lies the surface membrane, a thick organic structure that covers the mineralization chamber and the forming nacre. The surface membrane is a dynamic structure that grows by the addition of vesicles on the outer side and recedes by the formation of interlamellar membranes on the inner side. By using a combination of electron microscopy imaging and spectroscopy, we have monitored the journey of the vesicles from the mantle epithelium to the mineralization chamber, focusing on the elemental composition of the organic structures at each stage. Our data reveal that transport occurs in lipid bilayer vesicles through exocytosis from the outer mantle epithelium. After release into the surface membrane, chitin undergoes a process of self-assembly and interaction with proteins, resulting in progressive changes of the internal structure of the surface membrane until the final structure of the interlamellar membranes is acquired. Finally, these detach from the inner side of the surface membrane. Elemental analysis revealed the transport of a considerable amount of calcium bound to proteins, likely forming calcium-protein complexes. Statement of significance: The formation of nacre tablets occurs through the incorporation of organic and mineral precursors extruded from the mantle epithelium. Although much attention has been paid to the presence of amorphous phases in recent decades, the calcium transport system has not yet been elucidated. We have monitored the packaging of organic and mineral precursors in the form of vesicles from the mantle epithelium to the mineralization chamber. We have shown that the surface membrane represents the zone where chitin and protein polymerization takes place, acquiring the final structure for the formation of interlamellar membranes. Interestingly, these organic structures transport a considerable amount of organic calcium into the mineralization chamber, which support a transport system based on acidic calcium-binding proteins. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.actbio.2024.11.025,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85210544290

However, this progression needs to be sustainable, which can potentially be achieved by the implementation of circular practices. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems promote the incorporation of circular principles. Nevertheless, the lack of harmonized definitions and standards impedes the quantification of these circular attributes. This study aims to explore the potential principles embedded in IMTA and the existing alternatives to quantify circularity. Two basic pillars (nutrient management and resource use efficiency) were identified as the most relevant circularity attributes for IMTA systems and were quantified through aquaculture-specific indicators. Bioremediation indicators, together with the efficiency indicators in terms of feed, water, energy, and infrastructure materials used, were selected to evaluate the circularity performance of four IMTA trials in three aquaculture facilities in Ireland, Brazil, and South Africa. Salmon, white shrimp, tilapia, abalone, and sea urchins were studied and cultivated together in various combinations with several low-trophic species in these IMTA trials to evaluate the improvement in circularity compared with corresponding monoculture conditions. The results showed an increase in circularity of up to 90% in terms of water recirculation, as well as bioremediation, which was improved by 80%–90%, providing evidence for the potential role of IMTA in the circularity transition. © 2024 by the authors.",10.3390/fishes9050165,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85194250412

A total of 400 ten-month-old Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) were randomly sampled. To evaluate feed efficiency traits, each abalone was cultured for 72 days using the previously established single-individual system. After that, the FER was ranked after removing outliers, the top and bottom 150 individuals were exposed to different durations of fasting stress (3, 7, 10, 14, and 21 days), which was followed by single-individual re-feeding treatments. The fluctuations in body weight of each abalone during this process were recorded. The difference in the ability to cope with fasting stress and re-feed between the high- and low-FER (feed efficiency ratio) groups was analyzed. The findings demonstrated that the specific weight loss rate (SWLR) of the high- and low-FER groups of Pacific abalone differed after varying durations of fasting. The results of the correlation analysis between FER and weight change index showed that SWLR was negatively correlated with FER during stress, and the correlation of the 7-day fasting group (S7) was the highest (r = –0.71). The “rapid growth stage” during re-feeding was positively correlated with FER, and the correlation between the body weight gain (BWG) of days 14–28 and FER in the 10-day fasting group (S10) was the highest (r = 0.79). The results indicate that there is significant variation in the capacity of abalone to resist fasting stress and re-feeding, and this is associated with feed efficiency. The above measured indicators (SWLR of the S7 group and BWG14–28 of the S10 group) may be used as indirect indicators for feed efficiency traits, and these indicators have application value in abalone breeding. © 2025 The Authors",10.1016/j.aqrep.2025.102793,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002495794

In this study, Laminaria digitata fucoidan (LF) was extracted from Laminaria digitata, and purified using DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow gel column to obtain four different grades. Among those, LF4 (Mw:165 kDa), mainly composed of fucose(56.80 %), had the highest total sugar (66.91 %) and sulfate (17.07 %) content. FT-RT and NMR results showed that LF4 was mainly composed of galactosylated galactofucose, and has a sulfate group attached to fucose C4. With the animal experimentation, it was revealed that hyperlipidaemic mice had significantly higher levels of TC (5.52 mmol/L), TG (2.28 mmol/L) and LDL-C (5.12 mmol/L) and significantly lower levels of HDL-C (2 mmol/L). However, LF had the efficacy in modulating the lipid metabolism disturbances induced by hyperlipidemia, as well as the ability to regulate cholesterol transport in serum. Moreover, it regulated AMPK/ACC, PPAR-α/LAXRa, Nrf2/Nqo1, TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway genes and proteins expression in the liver. In addition, it promoted the production of beneficial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) while improving the composition and structure of gut microbiota, including balancing the abundance of Bacteroidota, Firmicutes, Muribaculaceae, Alloprevotella, Escherichia-Shigella, Prevotella and NK4A136.

To understand the involvement of HSBP1 in the heat shock response and embryonic and larval development of Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), the Hdh-HSBP1 gene was sequenced from the digestive gland (DG) tissue. The full-length sequence of Hdh-HSBP1 encompassed 738 nucleotides, encoding an 8.42 kDa protein consisting of 75 deduced amino acids. The protein contains an HSBP1 domain and a coiled-coil domain, which are conserved features in the HSBP1 protein family. Protein-protein molecular docking revealed that the coiled-coil region of Hdh-HSBP1 binds to the coiled-coil region of Hdh-HSF1. Tissue expression analysis demonstrated that the highest Hdh-HSBP1 expression occurred in the DG, whereas seasonal expression analysis revealed that this gene was most highly expressed in summer. In heat-stressed abalone, the highest expression of Hdh-HSBP1 occurred at 30 °C. Moreover, time-series analysis revealed that the expression of this gene began to increase significantly at 6 h post-heat stress, with higher expression observed at 12 h and 24 h post-heat stress. Furthermore, Hdh-HSBP1 mRNA expression showed a link to ROS production. Additionally, the expression of Hdh-HSBP1 showed significantly higher expression in the early stages of embryonic development in Pacific abalone. These results suggest that Hdh-HSBP1 plays a crucial role in the stress physiology of Pacific abalone by interacting with Hdh-HSF1, as well as its embryonic development. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.fsi.2024.109660,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85195860282
Swaroop C.R.; Raja K.,Design of A Novel Generative Adversarial Network for Outlier Prediction with AMBO Algorithm,2024,Wireless Personal Communications,138,4,2299,2319,,"Outlier detection identifies the objects which are deviated from the other objects in the dataset. However, outlier detection is challenged due to data scarcity and abnormal system behaviour. These limitations are resolved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) which has significant attention with the capacity of new data generation. In this paper, the novel outlier detection approach Adaptive Mine Blast Optimization (AMBO) GAN is proposed for differentiating the fake data from the original one. GAN improves the data quality and efficiency by correcting errors and reducing the noise. GAN involves iterative backup loop between generator and descriminator. The network loss of GAN is minimized with AMBO algorithm which outperforms other metaheuristic approaches in terms of convergence and solution. In AMBO, the function values are minimized to near optimal solution during early iterations. The proposed approach is analysed with abalone age dataset in which the classification related metrics are considered for performance evaluation. In addition to that, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, AUC, and G-mean performance obtained with the proposed approach is 95%, 96%, 98%, 0.92, and 0.9564 respectively. The numerical outcomes show that the model is best suited for real-time environment and outperforms the functionality of the existing systems. Proposed appraoch is appropriate for real-time applications as it learns the dataset’s internal data representations and complex data. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",10.1007/s11277-024-11601-6,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207263543
Cai H.; Zhang M.; Gao R.; Liu Y.; Gao X.,Effects of intermittent fasting on behavioral and physiological stress indicators in Pacific abalone during persistent ocean heat waves,2025,Aquaculture,602,,,,742367,"Global climate change has increased the frequency of marine heat waves, posing a continuous threat to the survival of economically relevant shellfish species. This, in turn, affects the stability of ecological systems and the security of the aquaculture industry. In this study, we investigated the effects of different fasting regimens (GY: fasting at 1-day intervals, GL: fasting at 2-day intervals) on the behavioral and physiological adaptability of Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), a marine gastropod, particularly in response to recurrent marine heat waves. Our findings revealed that the survival rates of abalone in both the GY and GL groups were significantly higher than those in the unfasted control group (ZC) (P < 0.05). Furthermore, behavioral assessments revealed that the cumulative distance moved, feeding durations, and the percentage of cumulative feeding time relative to movement time were significantly greater in the GL group compared to both the ZC and GY groups (P < 0.05). Sequencing of the 16S rDNA amplicon revealed that the intestinal microbial community of abalone in the GL group harbored a higher abundance of beneficial bacteria (Arenimonas, Pseudolabrys) compared to the GY and ZC groups. In contrast, the potentially harmful bacterium Tenacibaculum was significantly reduced in the GY group relative to the ZC group (P < 0.05). A non-targeted metabolomics analysis identified amino acids and fatty acids, such as Citrulline, Leu-Pro, and L-Glutamate, as differential metabolic markers. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the ‘Biosynthesis of amino acids’ pathway was significantly enriched in both the GY and GL groups compared to the ZC group (P < 0.05). Further analysis of 23 amino acids showed that 15 and 20 amino acids, including glycine and serine, were downregulated in the GY and GL groups, respectively, compared to the ZC group. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between the relative abundance of both Arenimonas and Pseudolabrys in the abalone's gut and citrulline content in the GY and GL groups (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that intermittent fasting not only promotes energy redistribution, serving as an effective strategy for abalone to cope with oceanic heat waves, but also provides valuable insights into the behavioral and physiological plasticity of marine shellfish in response to global climate change. © 2024",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2025.742367,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219419273

Abalones were fed diets with graded levels of bile acids (0, 15.91, 34.62, 61.75, 131.98 and 246.63 mg/kg, respectively). The results showed that appropriate dietary bile acids levels (15.91–61.75 mg/kg) promoted the springiness, chewiness, hardness, shear force and water holding capacity of muscle in abalone. Furthermore, 34.62 mg/kg of dietary bile acids had positive effects on the content of muscle fiber and collagen. Dietary bile acids regulated the expression of genes involved in collagen transcriptional regulation (P38/MAPK signaling pathway), post-translational modification (p4hα1, lox, and plod), collagen degradation (mmp1 and timp), muscle fiber growth, protein metabolism, glycolysis and anti-oxidative capacity, all of which contributed to the increased muscle hardness.

The effect of dehulled soybean meal (DSM), soy protein concentrate (SPC) and corn gluten meal (CGM) on abalone H. discus hannai were evaluated through 16S rRNA, transcriptomics and metabolomics in the present study. The core gut microbiota of abalone varied among the different diet groups (DSM, SPC and GCM): Mycoplasma (57.51 %, 64.39 %, 70.23 %). Multi-omics integrative analysis indicated that abalone fed with the SPC diet effectively activated nutrients metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis via microbiota -gut-digestive gland axis. Abalone fed with the SPC diet had the lowest chewiness, gumminess and hardness of muscle. Moreover, abalone fed with the DSM diet significantly increased the abundance of Bacteroidetes, which significantly impacted the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis metabolism through the microbiota-gut-digestive gland axis. In contrast, the CGM diet led to a significant changes in the gut microbiota of abalone, characterized by an increased abundance of Marinifilaceae and Bacteroides, while the abundance of Proteobacteria decreased. This microbial change was associated with reduced activity of the gut digestive enzyme pectinase, ultimately affecting the efficiency of nutrient absorption. In addition, there was a correlation between gut microbial abundance, gut enzyme activities and cell-free hemolymph metabolite content, which might be the reason for the difference in utilization of different plant protein sources by abalone. These results light the functional interaction between the gut milieu and the digestive gland axis under the efficacy of different protein sources. © 2025",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2025.742501,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002016759

PAH has been confirmed to have antibacterial and antifungal properties, but its antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities against Vibrio parahaemolyticus (V. parahaemolyticus) have not been reported. This work aimed to explore the antibacterial and antibiofilm efficacy of PAH against V. parahaemolyticus and its potential application in seafood. PAH showed moderate inhibitory effect against V. parahaemolyticus with minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) ranging from 20 to 40 mM. PAH destroyed cell membrane integrity and structure, as evidenced by the leakage of intracellular components and decreased cell viability. Meanwhile, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) indicated the involvement of oxidative stress in bactericidal mechanisms. PAH at subinhibitory concentrations (SICs) effectively reduced biofilm biomass as measured by crystal violet staining and plate colony counts assay. Furthermore, biofilm inhibitory effect of PAH on V. parahaemolyticus was also manifested by loose structure, decreased extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) contents of biofilm cells and less viable cells inside the biofilm. RT-qPCR showed that the expression of genes involved in biofilm was suppressed by PAH. Lastly, PAH (MIC and 2MIC) significantly decreased the level of V. parahaemolyticus in spiked abalone and shrimp samples without affecting sensory acceptability. These findings suggested that PAH might be potentially utilized individually or in combination with other preservation strategies to control V. parahaemolyticus infection and its biofilm in seafoods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.foodcont.2024.110730,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85199304897

In this study, the relationship between aroma characteristics and lipid profile of abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) during seasonal fluctuation and thermal processing were profiled via volatolomics and lipidomics. 46 aroma compounds and 371 lipids were identified by HS-SPME-GC–MS and UPLC-Q-Extractive Orbitrap-MS, respectively. Multivariate statistical analysis indicated that carbonyls (aldehydes and ketones) and alcohols were the characteristic aroma compounds of abalone. The fluctuations in the aroma compound and lipid composition of abalone were consistent with the seasonal variation, especially seawater temperature. In addition, based on the correlation analysis, it was found that carbonyls (aldehydes and ketones) and alcohols had a positive correlation with phospholipids (lysophosphatidylethanolamines and lysophosphatidylcholines), while a negative correlation was observed with fatty acyls.

Additionally, DEAD-box family genes have also been identified as being related to gonadal development in many species. However, the function of vasa and PL10 in abalone is poorly understood on a molecular level. Methods: In the present study, we individually isolated and characterized the vasa and PL10 orthologs in Haliotis discus hannai (Hdh-vasa and Hdh-PL10). We also characterized the mRNA distributions of vasa and PL10 in various tissues from adult organisms and different embryonic developmental stages using real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) techniques. Furthermore, spatial and temporal expression of Hdh-vasa and Hdh-PL10 throughout embryonic and larval development was examined by whole-mount in situ hybridization (WMISH). Results: The two predicted amino acid sequences contained all of the conserved motifs characterized by the DEAD-box family. Homology and phylogenetic analyses indicate that they belong to the vasa and PL10 subfamilies. We found that vasa and PL10 mRNA were not solely restricted to gonads but were widely expressed in various tissues. WMISH showed that Hdh-vasa and Hdh-PL10 largely overlapped, with both being maternally expressed and specifically localized to the micromere lineage cells during early cleavage stages. By the gastrulation stage, Hdh-vasa were expressed strongly in two bilaterally symmetrical paraxial clusters, but Hdh-PL10 was dispersed in entire endodermal region. Our results suggest that Hdh-vasa-expressing cells are located as a subpopulation of undifferentiated multipotent cells that express Hdh-PL10. As such, we infer that primordial germ cells are specified from these vasa-expressing cells at some point during development, and inductive signals (epigenesis) play an important role in specifying primordial germ cells (PGCs) in H. discus hannai. Conclusions: This study provides valuable insights into the molecular characteristics and expression patterns of Hdh-vasa and Hdh-PL10, contributing to a better understanding of their roles in germ cell specification and early embryonic development in H. discus hannai. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/genes16030329,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000857352

Four experimental diets formulated with wheat starch, sweet potato starch, pea starch and corn starch, respectively, were fed to abalones (initial weight 4.56 ± 0.05 g) for 90 days. The results showed that the weight gain rate (WGR) of abalone in the pea starch group was the significantly highest (192.51 %) one, while the WGR in the wheat starch group was the lowest (174.36 %) one among all the four groups (P < 0.05). The intestinal α-amylase activity was higher in the corn starch and pea starch groups. The intestinal lipase activity was highest in the corn starch group, followed by the wheat starch group, and lowest in the sweet potato starch group. In terms of intestinal morphology, the intestinal villus width, height and perimeter ratio had the highest values in the pea starch group. In terms of glucose metabolism, both gluconeogenesis and glycolysis were at lower levels in the pea starch group, while glycogen synthesis was at a higher level.

This study evaluated some parameters of the systemic antioxidant and immune responses in red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) exposed to 0.25 mL L−1 eugenol (EUB), 3.0 mL L−1 phenoxyethanol (PEB) and CO2 at saturation, as well as in a control (CT) without anesthetic. Abalone were anesthetized for 45 min and, during the recovery stage, hemolymph samples were collected at 0.5, 1, 2 and 24 h. Total protein content (TP), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, as well as nitric oxide (NO) production, were evaluated in hemolymph cell-free fraction (HCF) and hemocytes lysate (HL). In addition, total hemocyte count (THC) was determined. In HCF, TP was significantly higher in abalone exposed to PEB than in the other treatments and CT at 0.5, 1 and 24 h. SOD activity in HCF was significantly higher in all treatments compared to the CT (1 h), while CAT and MPO activity was only significantly higher in abalone exposed to EUB compared to PEB at 1, 2 and 24 h. In the HL fraction, the percentage of SOD inhibition was significantly higher only in abalone anesthetized with EUB compared to the CT (0.5 h). These results suggest that the antioxidant activity of the species during the recovery phase from anesthesia was transient and restored after 24 h. Similarly, the immune response of H. rufescens at the systemic level was not altered by the anesthetics, suggesting that the species adequately tolerated the anesthesia process. This research provides evidence of the effects of anesthesia at the systemic level in red abalone for the proper selection of anesthetics for pearl culture. © 2024",10.1016/j.cbpa.2024.111800,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213884983

Therefore, this experiment was conducted to determine the effects of several carbohydrate sources, using a semi-purified base diet containing casein and gelatine, on the growth performance metrics and metabolic response of abalone, Haliotis discus hannai Ino. Six experimental diets were formulated containing 33.50 % of different carbohydrate sources including dextrin, pregelatinized wheat starch, wheat starch, tapioca starch, potato starch and corn starch. The diets were fed to the abalone with an initial weight of 3.42 ± 0.02 g in triplicate tanks for 24 weeks, housed in a recirculation system, with seawater maintained at 18–20 ℃. There were no significant differences detected in the average daily increment in shell length (DISL, μm/day) or survival of abalone fed the six treatments containing different carbohydrate sources. However, there were significant differences detected in the average final weight and weight gain rate (WGR, %) parameters, with the lowest final weight (8.16 ± 0.29 g) and WGR (140.38 ± 6.57 %) observed in the potato starch fed abalone.While the potato starch group had the ssignificant highest valuein the moisture content (79.31 ± 0.07 %), crude protein (75.37 ± 0.37 %) and crude ash (10.52 ± 0.20 %) present in the soft-tissue and similarly in the crude ash level (96.06 ± 0.29 %) in the shell composition among the six dietary treatments. There was no significant difference found in the soft-tissue lipid content (5.84–6.87 %). The dextrin-based diet led to elevated plasma glucose (0.85 ± 0.06 mmol/l) in abalone compared with the other treatment groups. The concentration of muscle glycogen in abalone fed with pregelatinized wheat starch showed the highest values with 78.45 ± 1.53 mg/g tissue, which was significantly different to the other treatment groups, however, the digestive gland glycogen content (15.56–19.27 mg/g tissue) was maintained at a constant level regardless of the dietary carbohydrate sources. The digestive gland α-amylase activity in abalone was significantly higher in the pregelatinized wheat starch fed abalone (211.65 ± 16.16 mg starch/30 min/g protein) compared to the dextrin (93.58 ± 13.40 mg starch/30 min/g protein) and potato (99.37 ± 11.15 mg starch/30 min/g protein) starch fed abalones. The results presented demonstrate that abalone efficiently utilized the carbohydrate sources evaluated in the present study, the dextrin and pregelatinized wheat starch were the most suitable sources based on the growth performance alone. There were discrete metabolic and enzymatic responses observed among the dietary groups, like the interrupting the normal glucose metabolic processes by the potato starch,which may lead to improved dietary formulations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2024.116143,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85208494684

This study evaluated the reproductive performance of tropical abalone (Haliotis squamata) broodstock, induced by feeding them formulated feed containing macroalgae as one of its protein sources. The experimental broodstock specimens were fed a formulated diet consisting of a combination of three macroalgae species: Gracillaria sp., Ulva sp., and Sargassum sp., with increasing protein levels (30, 35, 40, and 45%). The broodstocks were reared in a flow-through water system and fed the respective diet twice a day (5 AM and 8 PM). The gonad maturity level, gonad somatic index, fecundity, and hatching rate were measured at the end of the experiment. This study indicates that the gonad somatic index, fecundity, and hatching rate of the eggs were significantly influenced by the protein level of the diet, with higher values being obtained from the broodstock fed with high protein diets (40-45% crude protein). However, the gonad maturity level showed no difference across all treatments. This study suggests that broodstock reproductive performance can be improved by feeding them a high protein diet with macroalgae as one of the protein sources. © 2025, BIOFLUX SRL.

To date, over 95% of the abalone supply has been contributed by farming. Macroalgae are the natural food of abalones. However, the supply of macroalgae is unstable owing to seasonal restrictions. This limits the success of abalone farming. Therefore, formulated diets are crucial for the ongoing expansion and sustainable development of abalone culture. The most important considerations in formulated diets are the nutrient composition and commercially available feed ingredients. This review presents a comprehensive description of the nutrient requirements of abalones and the role that nutrients play in regulating abalone growth and health. The dietary proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, macroalgae sources and feed additives currently used in abalone feeds were subsequently summarised. Additionally, this review also highlights the importance of prioritizing the development of sustainable alternative sources of proteins, carbohydrates and macroalgae to meet the increasing demand for abalone feed. Based on the information provided, future directions in the knowledge of abalone nutrition and feeds are subsequently discussed, which will guide further research towards the development of well-balanced commercial feeds that enhance feed utilisation and promote abalone growth and health. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.",10.1111/raq.12911,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85194422276

Polysaccharides are considered to be one of their primary functional components, possessing various nutritional and biological properties, including immune modulation, anti-inflammatory effects, cardiovascular protection, antioxidant activity, anti-tumor effects, anti-diabetic properties, anticoagulation, and liver protection. Over the past few decades, a substantial amount of polysaccharides has been successfully extracted from abalone, demonstrating their potential in health and nutrition. However, significant gaps remain in the extraction processes of abalone polysaccharides, complex higher-order structures, and comprehensive evaluation of their structure-activity relationships. Therefore, this paper reviews the sources, extraction, purification, structural characteristics, biological activities, safety assessments, and structure-activity relationships of abalone polysaccharides.

Zhang Q.; Fu Y.; Zhang Y.; Liu H.,Genome-wide identification and expression profiling of the Wnt gene family in three abalone species,2024,Genes and Genomics,46,12,1363,1374,,"Background: The Wnt gene family plays pivotal roles in a variety of biological processes including cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis, and embryonic development. Identifying the Wnt signaling pathway in abalone could provide a basis for elucidating growth and development mechanisms and improving quality. Objective: To identify the number, protein physicochemical properties, gene structure, phylogenetic analysis, and expression profiles of the Wnt gene family in abalone. Methods: A comprehensive genome-wide analysis was performed to identify the Wnt gene family in the genomes of three abalone species (Haliotis discus hannai, H. rubra, and H. rufescens). Results: Ten single-copy Wnt genes were identified in each abalone species, suggesting that the number of Wnt genes was relatively conserved in Haliotis. Eight Wnt gene subfamilies, including Wnt1, Wnt4, Wnt5, Wnt6, Wnt7, Wnt10, Wnt16, and WntA, are present in all three species. Each abalone species contains two species-specific subfamilies (Wnt9 and Wnt11 in H. discus hannai, Wnt2 and Wnt11 in H. rubra, and Wnt2 and Wnt9 in H. rufescens), reflecting polymorphisms of the Wnt genes in Haliotis. Interestingly, gastropods are characterised by the loss of Wnt8, suggesting a potential evolutionary specificity in gastropods. As expected, Wnt3 is absent in all protostomes, including the abalone. In addition, spatio-temporal expression profiling revealed differential expression levels of the Wnt genes at different developmental stages and in different tissues of H. discus hannai. HdWnt5 and HdWntA might participate in several processes during larval development stages, including germ layer formation and body axis elongation. HdWnt5 may be involved in eye and tentacle development. HdWnt10 may be related to muscle development, and HdWnt6 may be involved in shell formation in abalone. Conclusion: To our knowledge, the results of this study, which is the first genome-wide investigation of the Wnt gene family in abalone, lay the groundwork for future research on the evolution and function of the Wnt gene family in Gastropoda. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Genetics Society of Korea 2024.",10.1007/s13258-024-01579-7,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206845598

Structural analysis confirmed that Hdh-VDAC2 is a pore-forming β-barrel protein. Molecular docking further confirmed the protein-protein interactions of Hdh-VDAC2 with Hdh-BAX, Hdh-caspase 3, and Hdh-BCL2. In the Hdh-VDAC2-inhibited hemocytes (HCY), apoptotic genes (Hdh-caspase-3 and Hdh-BAX) exhibited elevated mRNA expression, while the anti-apoptotic gene (Hdh-BCL2) was downregulated. Further, fluorescent techniques confirmed excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lower cell viability, elevated caspase 3 activity, and increased DNA fragmentation in Hdh-VDAC2-inhibited HCY, indicating an anti-apoptotic role of Hdh-VDAC2 in Pacific abalone. Transcriptomic analysis revealed differential expression patterns, with upregulation in the digestive gland (DG) and downregulation in the gill (GIL) and HCY when comparing heat-tolerant (HT) versus heat-sensitive (HS) abalone groups. Additionally, both cold and heat stresses induced Hdh-VDAC2 expression. Other environmental factors including H2O2, cadmium, bacteria, and viruses, were also shown to induce Hdh-VDAC2 mRNA expression in the GIL and DG of Pacific abalone. During metamorphosis, the blastula (BLS) stage exhibited higher Hdh-VDAC2 mRNA expression. These findings suggest that Hdh-VDAC2 plays a crucial anti-apoptotic role and may be a biomarker for summer mortality in Pacific abalone. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.137234,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85208101172

Thirty-four V. parahaemolyticus isolates were isolated by conducting biochemical tests and PCR. Isolation frequencies were 4 (cockles), 2 (scallops), 2 (mussels), 1 (Pacific abalone), and 25 (white-leg shrimp). The disc diffusion method was employed to detect antibiotic resistance. All isolates were resistant to ampicillin. Piperacillin, colistin, and vancomycin resistance were detected in 82%, 68%, and 50% of the isolates, respectively. Thirty-two isolates were multidrug resistant [Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) index ≥0.2]. β-lactam resistant blaSHV gene was the most prevalent gene detected in 68% of the isolates in PCR assays. In addition, blaCTX, aac(6’)-Ib, and blsTEM were detected in 21%, 44%, and 6% of the isolates, respectively. Phenotypic resistance to Pb, Cd, and Cu was detected in 25, 4, and 3 isolates, respectively in broth dilution test. CzcA gene was the prevalent detected in 16 isolates, followed by CopA and merA genes detected in 11 and 7 isolates, respectively.

Methods: After pretreated with different levels of PSP-SeNPs (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 µg/mL) for 24 h, AML12 cells were further treated with 300 mmol/L alcohol for 24 h to establish cell injury model. Hoechst staining was used to assess the degree of cell injury, and biochemical indicators related to oxidative stress were measured. Finally, qRT-PCR was used to measure the expression of oxidative stress-related genes in AML-12 cells. Results: Compared with the normal control group, the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) in the alcohol model group were significantly decreased (P<0.05), while the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were significantly increased (P<0.05). These changes were significantly reversed by PSP-SeNPs (P<0.05). qRT-PCR results showed that the mRNA levels of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), catalase (CAT), and glutamate-cysteine ligase regulatory subunit (GCLM) were significantly decreased in the alcohol model group as compared with the control group (P<0.05). Additionally, the alcohol induced up-regulation of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) mRNA was significantly reversed by PSP-SeNPs (P<0.05).

The control diet with FM as the main protein source (CON), and the four experimental diets with 50 % and 100 % SBM replacing FM (SBM50 and SBM100), and 25 % and 100 % SPC replacing FM (SPC25 and SPC100) were fed to abalone for 110 days. The intestinal microbiota analysis results revealed that there were no significant differences in α-diversity indices (Chao1, Ace, Sobs, and Shannon) among all groups. However, analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) demonstrated dramatic shifts in the intestinal microbiota component at the genus level among the groups. Venn diagram analysis identified 470 overlapping operational taxonomic units (OTUs) across the five groups, with the SBM50 and CON groups exhibiting the highest and lowest number of unique OTUs, respectively. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the predominant phyla in abalone, with Mycoplasma being the dominant genus (CON: 42.95 %; SBM50: 23.98 %; SBM100: 49.32 %; SPC25: 27.20 %; SPC100: 34.25 %). Notably, the pathogens Vibrio abundance in the SPC25 group was significantly lower than in the CON group. The intestinal microbiota networks in the CON, SBM50, SBM100, SPC25, and SPC100 groups consisted of 1757, 2140, 1992, 2281 and 1747 edges, respectively. Furthermore, correlation heatmap results suggested that digestive enzymes and immune indices in abalone were associated with specific intestinal microbiota. Functional prediction via the KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the replacement levels of dietary FM with SBM and SPC significantly affect various biological functions of the intestinal microbiota. In summary, feeding SBM (50 %) and SPC (25 %) diets to abalone increased the abundance of beneficial bacterium in the intestines, contributing to improved digestion and increased growth rate of abalone. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.fsi.2024.110060,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211061882

The objective of this research is to provide the first information on the pollution characteristics of 16 PAEs in different shellfish species from the Pearl River Delta (PRD), South China, and associated health risks. Among the 16 analyzed PAEs, 13 were identified in the shellfish, with total PAE concentrations ranging from 23.07 to 3794.08 ng/g dw (mean = 514.35 ng/g dw). The PAE pollution levels in the five shellfish species were as follows: Ostreidae (mean = 1064.12 ng/g dw) > Mytilus edulis (mean = 509.88 ng/g dw) > Babylonia areolate (mean = 458.14 ng/g dw) > Mactra chinensis (mean = 378.90 ng/g dw) > Haliotis diversicolor (mean = 335.28 ng/g dw). Dimethyl phthalate (DMP, mean = 69.85 ng/g dw), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP, mean = 41.39 ng/g dw), dibutyl phthalate (DBP, mean = 130.91 ng/g dw), and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP, mean = 226.23 ng/g dw) were the most abundant congeners. Notably, DEHP constituted the most predominant fraction (43.98 %) of the 13 PAEs detected in all shellfish from the PRD. Principal component analysis indicated that industrial and domestic emissions served as main sources for the PAE pollution in shellfish from the PRD. It was estimated that the daily intake of PAEs via shellfish consumption among adults and children ranged from 0.004 to 1.27 μg/kgbw/day, without obvious non-cancer risks (< 0.034), but the cancer risks raised some alarm (2.0 × 10−9–1.4 × 10−5). These findings highlight the necessity of focusing on marine environmental pollutants and emphasize the importance of ongoing monitoring of PAE contamination in seafood. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.172984,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85192486228

With graded levels of dietary protein (9.33%, 27.53% and 40.42%, respectively), three isolipidic and isoenergetic diets were made and used in two water temperatures (17 °C and 23 °C) in a form of a 3 × 2 factorial design. The results indicated that the weight gain rate (WGR) and daily increment in shell length of abalones (DISL) were significantly higher in 27.53% of dietary protein level at both 17 °C and 23 °C water temperatures. At 17 °C and 23 °C of water temperatures, 27.53% of dietary protein significantly increased the trypsin and α- amylase as well as decreased the malondialdehyde content and glutamate dehydrogenase activities of abalone. Dietary protein and water temperature interact significantly with WGR and α-amylase. The histological analysis of abalone's digestive gland showed that 27.53% of dietary protein caused normal development at both water temperatures. The mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, toll-like receptor 2 and 4, inhibitor κBα, iκb kinase α, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88, interleukin1 receptor-associated kinase 4, caspase 3 and B-cell lymphoma protein-2-associated X protein were significantly down-regulated by 27.53% of dietary protein at 17 °C of water temperature. The total hemocyte counts (THC), respiratory burst (RB) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) were significantly increased by 27.53% of dietary protein at 17 °C water temperature. Dietary protein and water temperature interact significantly with THC, RB and Bcl-2. The use of 27.53% of dietary protein at 17 °C of water temperature showed no mortality when challenged with V. parahaemolyticus.

Six isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets were prepared by adding 0 (control group), 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 mg/kg of bile acids, respectively (named BA0, BA15, BA30, BA60, BA120 and BA240, respectively). It was found that survival of abalone between groups had no significant difference (P > 0.05). Compared to the control, significant improvements in weight gain rate (WGR) were observed in the groups of BA30 and BA60 (P < 0.05). Based on WGR, the broken line regression model analysis showed that the optimum demand for dietary bile acids for abalone was 35.47 mg/kg. Dietary bile acids increased the total anti-oxidative capacity and activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, lysozyme and alkaline phosphatase, meanwhile decreased the content of malondialdehyde, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities in the cell-free hemolymph (P < 0.05). When bile acids were added to the diets, mRNA levels of genes related to pro-inflammatory factors and apoptosis in the digestive gland were down-regulated (P < 0.05). In contrast, the expression of genes related to anti-oxidation was significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05). The Firmicutes, Actinobacteriota and Proteobacteria were the most abundant phyla in intestine. And dietary bile acids significantly decreased the abundance of Actinobacteria and increased the abundance of Firmicutes (P < 0.05). In conclusion, supplementation of dietary bile acids within 120 mg/kg significantly increased the growth of abalone. The 34.62 mg/kg of dietary bile acids significantly increased the anti-oxidative capacity of abalone. Appropriate levels of dietary bile acids (34.62–61.75 mg/kg) promote the immunity of abalone. Application of appropriate levels of bile acids in diets (34.62 mg/kg) changed the intestinal microbiota and promoted the intestinal health of abalone. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.fsi.2023.109114,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85173605129

The role of plasticity and acclimation, within and across generations, may be essential given the pace of change. We investigated plasticity across generations and life stages in response to ocean acidification (OA), which poses a growing threat to both wild populations and the sustainable aquaculture of shellfish. Most studies of OA on shellfish focus on acute effects, and less is known regarding the longer term carryover effects that may manifest within or across generations. We assessed these longer term effects in red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) using a multi-generational split-brood experiment. We spawned adults raised in ambient conditions to create offspring that we then exposed to high pCO2 (1180 μatm; simulating OA) or low pCO2 (450 μatm; control or ambient conditions) during the first 3 months of life. We then allowed these animals to reach maturity in ambient common garden conditions for 4 years before returning the adults into high or low pCO2 treatments for 11 months and measuring growth and reproductive potential. Early-life exposure to OA in the F1 generation decreased adult growth rate even after 5 years especially when abalone were re-exposed to OA as adults. Adult but not early-life exposure to OA negatively impacted fecundity. We then exposed the F2 offspring to high or low pCO2 treatments for the first 3 months of life in a fully factorial, split-brood design. We found negative transgenerational effects of parental OA exposure on survival and growth of F2 offspring, in addition to significant direct effects of OA on F2 survival.

In the light of this approach, the mixture of abalone waste and Sargassum spp (9:1) fermented by Saccharomyces cereviceae and Lactobacillus casei (Yakult®) (FMAS) were used to replace 0% (FMAS0), 25% (FMAS-25), 50% (FMAS-50), 75% (FMAS-75), and 100% (FMAS-100) of fishmeal (FM) protein in marron, Cherax cainii diet. The marron was fed these diets in triplicate for 90 days. Growth, feed utilization and protein efficiency ratio were unchanged in marron-fed all test diets. Improvement in apparent protein digestibility was aligned with an increase in the size and number of B-cells in the hepatopancreas. Most of the immune responses, except for haemocyte clotting time, hyaline cells and neutral red retention time (NRR time) were unchanged by 42- and 90-days feeding trials compared to those of the control group. 90 days post-feeding marron with FMAS25 showed a lower haemocyte clotting time than the post 42 days feeding marron with the same diet. Hyaline cells increased in marron fed FMAS75 for 90 days compared to marron fed the same diet for 42 days. The challenge test involved injecting marron with Vibrio mimicus resulted in a 100% survival rate after 96 h of exposure. During the challenge test, phagocytosis activity in 24 and 48-h post-challenged marron fed FMAS75 decreased which recovered after 96 h post-challenge. Marron fed FMAS50 also recorded a significantly higher proportion of granular cells after 24 h and NRR time at 96 h compared with that of other treatments. Given the above indicators of bio-growth, feed efficiency and immune responses, total replacement of FM protein of marron practical feed with FMAS are considered feasible and optimum to maintain health status and resistance to disease. © 2023",10.1016/j.fsi.2023.108748,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85153218017

This study investigated the effects of water temperatures and the presence or absence of sand substrate in tanks on the growth of N. grammatus fed an equal ration of abalone waste for eight weeks. Sea cucumbers with a mean weight of 8.34 g were used for the study. The treatments used in the study were Ambient water temperature + sand (A + S), Ambient water temperature without sand (A-S), Cold water temperature + sand (C + S), and Cold-water temperature without sand (C–S). The cold/constant water temperature was 16°C and was representative of winter conditions while the ambient/fluctuating water temperature fluctuated between 16.4 and 18.7 °C and was representative of spring conditions. At the end of the study, the sea cucumbers in A + S and C + S treatment groups exhibited an overall weight increase of 21.08% and 6.18%, respectively. The sea cucumbers reared in ambient water temperature exhibited significantly higher mean weight than those reared in cold water (F1, 66 = 5.69; p = 0.02), and sea cucumbers reared with sand substrate had significantly higher mean weight compared to those without sand substrate (F1,66 = 19.06; p = <0.001). This study has shown that growth rates of N. grammatus in tanks were higher in ambient temperatures and that stress was reduced in the presence of sand, a habitat that mimics its natural environment. This implies that sand substrate may be necessary for the farming of N. grammatus. © 2024 The Author(s).

To evaluate the anti-aging activity of ARE, longevity, exercise ability, lipofuscin level, reproductive ability, and anti-stress ability of Caenorhabditis elegans were detected respectively. The results showed that the main component of ARE was protein. Compared with the control group, the high, middle, and low dose of ARE could significantly prolong the life span of C. elegans, improve the movement ability of C. elegans (the proportion of type A movement increased), and reduce the level of lipofuscin in vivo. Among them, the highest dose of ARE treatment group (2.50 mg/mL) had the strongest effect. The levels of the above indicators changed by 17.36%, 56. 66%, and 21. 93% respectively (P < 0. 05). ARE improved the anti-stress ability of C. elegans. Specifically, the 2. 5 mg/mL ARE treatment group compared with the control group improved the survival rate of heat-damaged C. elegans by 35. 85%, and increased the average life span of C. elegans by 25. 73% under paraquat induced stress condition. Meanwhile, ARE increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) in C. elegans and significantly reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) level. In addition, ARE increased reproductive capacity accompanied with prolonged life span of C. elegans. In conclusion, ARE exhibits good anti-aging activity, which lays a good foundation for the development of abalone functional food. © The Author(s) 2023.",10.13995/j.cnki.11-1802/ts.035128,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85169611105

This study specifically examined their impact as feed additives on the abalone Haliotis gigantea. We prepared 13 compound feeds with varying levels of astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and β-carotene, and administered them to both common-footed and orange-footed H. gigantea. The survival rate of H. gigantea was about 70–80%, with no significant differences in survival observed among the various carotenoid-supplemented feeding groups or when compared with the control group, nor between orange-footed and common-footed individuals. In heat attachment duration experiments, orange-foot abalones exhibited longer attachment durations with certain concentrations of astaxanthin and zeaxanthin, whereas common-foot abalones showed extended durations with astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and β-carotene, indicating that common-foot abalones might benefit more from these carotenoids. Additionally, our results showed similar patterns and levels of Vibrio harveyi AP37 resistance in both orange-footed and common-footed H. gigantea, suggesting a uniform response to carotenoid supplementation in their bacterial defense mechanisms. This study suggests the potential benefits of carotenoid supplementation in H. gigantea and contributes to the theoretical basis for developing high-quality artificial compound feeds. © 2024 by the authors.",10.3390/ani14020180,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85183086710

Eight isonitrogenous diets with two levels of lipid (4.3% and 6.3%) and four levels of bile acids (0, 15, 60 and 240 mg/kg) were formulated in a 2 × 4 two-factor design. The results showed that 6.3% of dietary lipid decreased the weight gain rate (WGR) of abalone, which increased as the dietary bile acids level increasing from 0 mg/kg to 60 mg/kg. The treatment with the highest WGR contained 4.3% of dietary lipid and 60 mg/kg of dietary bile acids. In the groups with 4.3% of dietary lipid, the expression of genes involved in lipid transport and lipolysis was increased (P < 0.05). And dietary bile acids increased the expression of genes involved in lipid transport and lipolysis while decreased the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis (P < 0.05). The expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, such as cluster of differentiation, fatty acid transport protein, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, revealed the interactions between dietary lipid and bile acids (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the growth and digestion of abalone were negatively impacted by an excessively high dietary lipid content (6.3%). Appropriate supplemented level of dietary bile acids (60 mg/kg) significantly enhanced the growth and digestion of abalone. Dietary lipid and bile acids had an interactive effect on the lipid metabolism in abalone, including lipid transport, lipolysis and lipogenesis. © 2023 The Authors",10.1016/j.aqrep.2023.101560,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85151413337

Increasing mean sea surface temperature may alter the distribution of abalone species in the northeastern Pacific, although no apparent pattern has yet emerged. Ecophysiological observations (energy budget and the temperature performance curve based on scope for growth), satellite-derived daily sea surface temperature data, and observations of the population density distribution of wild abalones were integrated. The highest temperature-dependent scope for growth (physiological optimum) was discovered between 20.5 and 28.5 °C, peaking at 24 °C, with the upper thermal limit about 30 °C. Off the west coast of Baja California, the distribution of abalone appears to be dictated by the tradeoff between a mean temperature close to the physiological optimum and exposure to a highly variable environment (i.e., more stress and the risk of reaching suboptimal and lethal warm temperatures at the daily scale). The findings suggest that future models of the distribution of marine species in relation to thermal habitat should contain time-domain variability in addition to spatial-domain variability. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ecss.2023.108252,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85150811275

Additionally, abalone hold essential ecological value by serving as a grazer and providing a microhabitat for various benthic organisms. Currently, seawater is experiencing a decrease in pH due to increased carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. It is projected that by 2100, the pH of seawater will decrease by approximately 0.3–0.4 units, with this trend continuing to 0.7–0.8 units by 2300. Abalone is particularly susceptible to ocean acidification due to its limited ability to maintain acid-base balance. Moreover, even if the effects on abalone are not lethal, world production values and ecosystem balance are likely to be impacted. This review examines the economic and ecological significance of abalone, as well as the morphological and physiological effects of ocean acidification on abalone during its early development, juvenile, and adult stages based on previous studies. In summary, the adverse effects of ocean acidification on abalone depend on several aspects, including the species, developmental stage, size, and duration of exposure. © 2024 The Korean Society of Fisheries and Aquatic Science.",10.47853/FAS.2024.e68,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212760330

However, this association leads to continuous oxidation of the galvanic anode and therefore to a release of a metal cocktail in the forms of ions or oxy-hydroxides. Therefore, the main objective of our study was to investigate the toxicity of elements released from the dissolution of an aluminium-based galvanic anode (∼95% Al, ∼5% Zn, <0.1% for In, Cu, Cd, Mn, Fe) on a grazing gastropod, the abalone Haliotis tuberculata. The present study was carried out in complement to other research currently in submission. Gastropods were exposed for 16 weeks (12 weeks of exposure and 4 weeks of decontamination phase) to 6 conditions including a control, 4 concentrations based on total aluminium level (86, 425, 1096 and 3549 µg L−1) and a trophic control, corresponding to abalones placed in non-contaminated natural seawater but fed with contaminated algae. The effects of metals on growth, glycogen levels, brix index of hemolymph, MDA levels in digestive gland and gills, hemocyte phagocytic activity, ROS production, lysosomal system and the progress of gametogenesis were investigated throughout the entire exposure allowing the realization of kinetics. The results revealed that the aluminium-based anode does not seem to have an effect on the health status of the individuals for environmentally realistic concentrations.

Temperature has important effects on the feeding and growth of abalone, and genotype by environment (G × E) interactions should be considered in selecting breeding programs for genetic gain. To improve the selection strategy, FE performance, genetic parameters, and G × E interactions of abalone were measured and evaluated at 17 °C, 21 °C, and 27 °C. The feed efficiency ratio (FER) showed a similar degree of phenotypic variation at all three temperatures, with the best phenotypic performance at 17 °C. The heritability of FER was high (0.55–0.72) and relatively stable at different temperatures, while the heritability of residual feed intake (RFI) changed with temperature and was 0.21 at 27 °C. The FER had a high positive genetic correlation (0.68–0.75) with specific growth rates (SGRs) and a genetic correlation ranging from 0.32 to 0.81 with food intake (FI). RFI had a low genetic correlation with growth (−0.43 to 0.03) and a high genetic correlation (0.42–0.82) with FI. The between-environment genetic correlations for FI, weight gain (WG), and FER were high (0.78–0.94). However, the RFI showed significant G × E interactions at different temperatures. By combining the performance results, genetic parameters, and G × E interactions, it was found that FER was the most suitable trait for improving abalone FE at variable temperatures in breeding programs.

AVP prepared by alcalase exhibited the highest selenium-chelating ability. UV–visible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and other structural analysis showed that selenium was mainly bound to the functional groups of –NH, –OH, –CH, C[dbnd]C, C[dbnd]O, and C–N bonds on AVP. The formation of AVP-selenium chelate enhanced thermal stability and generated a new crystal structure. The ABTS•+ and •OH scavenging activities of AVP-selenium chelate were increased after in vitro digestion than that of AVP.

In this study, we investigated the effect of Bacillus sp. KRF-7 (KRF-7), Bacillus sp. PM8313 (PM8313), β-glucooligosaccharide (BGO), and their synbiotics on the growth, digestive physiology, immunity, and gut microbiota of abalone, Haliotis discus hannai. The control diet (CON) was sprayed with 108 CFU/g KRF-7 (PRO1) or PM8313 (PRO2) as probiotics, 0.10% BGO (PRE) as prebiotic, and their combinations (SYN1: PRO1 + BGO; SYN2: PRO2+ BGO) as synbiotic treatments. These diets (triplicates) were given once daily to the abalone (initial body weight: 1.32 ± 0.05 g, initial shell length: 21. 69 ± 0.19 mm) for 12 weeks. The results showed that the PRE diet induced a significant 15% shell length and body weight increase against the CON (SLGR: 45.77% vs. 53.04%; WGR: 182.77% vs. 210.22%), the highest among dietary supplements (P < 0.05). The level of IGF and IGFBP in the cell-free hemolymph, protein expression of IGF signaling, and gene expression of myosin heavy chain in the adductor muscle increased significantly (P < 0.05) following dietary supplementation. Correspondingly, PRE-, PRO1-, and PRO2-fed abalone had the highest trypsin, lipase, and amylase secretion in the hepatopancreas (P < 0.05) and increased histomorphometry (stomach epithelial thickness and intestinal villi height) (P < 0.05). Regarding antioxidative capacity and immunity, the hepatopancreatic expression of SOD, CAT, IRAK-4, NF-Kb, TNF-α, and β-defensin were significantly upregulated in abalone fed with dietary additives compared to the CON (P < 0.05). In terms of gut microbiota profile, PRE-fed abalone had a significant reduction in microbial richness (P < 0.05).

This study also investigated whether betaine as an attractant supplementation could be used to facilitate RBM as a replacement for KM. In Trial 1, RBM was used to replace 25%, 50%, and 100% of the dietary KM (RBM25, RBM50, and RBM100, respectively) based on a diet containing 30% KM (Con). In Trial 2, RBM50 was the same as in Trial 1, and betaine was supplemented in RBM50 at 0.2% (B1), 0.4% (B2), and 0.8% (B3) in the diets. Abalone (weight approximately 4 g) were randomly assigned to four groups replicated in triplicate (60 abalone/replicate). The abalone were fed the experimental diets for 10 weeks. In Trial 1, compared to the Con group, no significant differences were observed in final weight (FW), final shell length (FSL), specific growth rate (SGR), or daily increment in shell length (DISL) at 25% KM replacement by RBM. However, 50% KM replacement significantly reduced the FW, FSL, SGR, and DISL compared to the Con group. There were no significant differences in the proximate composition of the soft body tissues of the abalone. In Trial 2, growth performance parameters of the hybrid abalone were significantly improved with increasing levels of betaine in the diets compared to those fed diet RBM50, reaching the maximum value in the B2 group. Consistent with the feed intake results, the hormone concentrations of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and orexins in the digestive gland and cerebral ganglia of abalone were significantly increased when the supplementation level of betaine in the diets was increased to 0.2%. However, no apparent impacts were observed on NPY or orexin concentrations among the B1, B2, and B3 groups. Finally, we suggest 0.4% betaine supplementation along with replacing 50% of the KM with RBM in the hybrid abalone diet. The optimal diet is a cost-effective alternative feed formulation that can reduce the dependence on KM for abalone production in China. This study also demonstrates the potential of betaine as a feed attractant in abalone aquaculture. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.740161,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85173270707

The halophyte sea purslane (Sesuvium portulacastrum) is nutritionally valuable and shows potential as a novel bait source for abalone. We analyzed the nutrient composition of blanched and salted sea purslane to assess the value of sea purslane as abalone feed. Subsequently, blanched and salted sea purslane were separately used as the sole feed for Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) with the same specifications in each group (shell length: 5.161±0.315 cm, body weight: 16.90±3.07 g). The red alga Gracilaria lemaneiformis served as the control feed. The abalone were feed once every 4 days over an 80-day culture cycle, with sufficient feed dispensed each time to ensure the provision of adequate feed and the generation of leftovers. There were four main findings. First, moisture, energy, crude protein (dry basis), crude fat, carbohydrate, and ash contents were (89.08± 0.01)%, (103.44±0.15) kJ/100 g, (12.49±0.28)%, (2.93±0.06)%, (20.34±0.28)%, and (29.10±0.08)%, respectively, for blanched sea purslane and (59.37±0.04)%, (139.38±0.79) kJ/100 g, (4.16±0.08)%, (1.25±0.01)%, (5.74±0.18)%, and (72.80±0.05)%, respectively, for salted sea purslane. Both types of sea purslane feed contained 18 amino acids, indicating a comprehensive amino acid profile that was relatively close to that of Pacific abalone muscle in terms of the presence of 11 important amino acids. Second, the two types of sea purslane feed significantly influenced the feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of Pacific abalone (P<0.05). The FI and FCR were highest in abalone that fed on salted sea purslane and lowest in abalone that fed on G. lemaneiformis. Neither type of sea purslane feed significantly influenced the survival rate, average daily shell length gain, average daily body weight gain, specific growth rate of shell length, specific growth rate of body weight, condition factor, or meat yield of Pacific abalone (P>0.05). Third, both types of sea purslane feed significantly increased the ash content and reduced the moisture, collagen, and total amino acid contents of Pacific abalone muscle (P<0.05); however, they did not significantly influence the crude fat content, essential amino acids/total amino acids ratio, first limiting amino acid content(P>0.05). The sea purslane feed could increase the linoleic acid and α-linolenic contents of Pacific abalone muscle. Fourth, there were no significant differences in the influence of the two types of sea purslane feed on the springiness and resilience of Pacific abalone muscle tissue (P>0.05). However, blanched sea purslane significantly reduced the hardness and chewiness of the muscle tissue (P<0.05), while salted sea purslane significantly increased the hardness of the muscle tissue (P<0.05). In conclusion, both types of sea purslane feed can replace G. lemaneiformis as feed for Pacific abalone within an 80-day culture cycle. Pacific abalone fed with sea purslane had good production performance and nutritional value, with salted purslane contributing to improved abalone muscle texture. © (2024), (Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences).

Rai S.,Implementation of biomimicry for advanced impact-resistant composites: Advanced manufacturing techniques,2024,Composites: Modeling and Manufacturing,,,166,179,,"Biomimicry is a novel strategy that uses nature's design principles to address an existing problem. It is an intriguing subject that involves biology, engineering, design, and materials science. Biomimicry for impact resistance designs is able to draw inspiration from a range of species, including molluscs like abalone, arthropods such as beetles and crustaceans, fish scales, and creatures like mantis shrimp and armadillos, each presenting distinct structural and defence mechanisms. In addition, helicoidal designs, bone-like structures, sutures, and tubular arrangements in nature are investigated for their impact-resistant characteristics and toughening mechanisms. Implementing biomimicry involves examining nature's details for a specific problem and then shifting those concepts into novel designs or processes. Interestingly, creating actual engineering product requires advanced manufacturing techniques utilising existing resources (or fabrication facilities) such as slip casting, powder metallurgy, additive manufacturing, and so on. These manufacturing methods are also discussed in detail, along with appropriate examples, for the fabrication of bioinspired composites. Overall, the chapter combines and addresses the idea of biomimicry, as well as the application of its concepts to actual products using advanced manufacturing processes for impact-resistant structures. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Vijay Kumar Singh, Nishant Kumar Singh and Yashvir Singh; individual chapters, the contributors.",10.1201/9781003564355-10,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214611574
Zou W.; Hong J.; Yu W.; Ma Y.; Gan J.; Liu Y.; Luo X.; You W.; Ke C.,Comprehensive Comparison of Effects of Antioxidant (Astaxanthin) Supplementation from Different Sources in Haliotis discus hannai Diet,2023,Antioxidants,12,8,,,1641,"Dietary antioxidant supplementation, especially astaxanthin, has shown great results on reproductive aspects, egg quality, growth, survival, immunity, stress tolerance, and disease resistance in aquatic animals. However, the effects of dietary astaxanthin supplementation from different sources are still unknown. A comprehensive comparison of survival, growth, immune response, antioxidant activity, thermal resistance, disease resistance, and intestinal microbial structure was conducted in dietary antioxidant supplementation from the sources of Gracilaria lemaneiformis (GL), industrial synthetic astaxanthin (80 mg/kg astaxanthin actual weight, named as group ‘SA80’), Phaffia rhodozyma (80 mg/kg astaxanthin actual weight, named as group ‘PR80’) and Haematococcus pluvialis (120 mg/kg astaxanthin actual weight, named as group ‘HP120’) at their optimal supplementation amounts. Furthermore, the SA80, PR80, and HP120 groups performed better in all aspects, including survival, growth, immune response, antioxidant activity, thermal resistance, and disease resistance, compared with the GL group. The PR80 and HP120 group also had a better growth performance than the SA80 group. In terms of heat stress and bacterial challenge, abalone in the PR80 group showed the strongest resistance. Overall, 80 mg/kg astaxanthin supplementation from Phaffia rhodozyma was recommended to obtain a more effective and comprehensive outcome. This study contributes to the discovery of the optimum dietary astaxanthin supplementation source for abalone, which is helpful to improve the production efficiency and economic benefits of abalone. Future research can further explore the action mechanism and the method of application of astaxanthin to better exploit its antioxidant role. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/antiox12081641,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85169120891
Lebata-Ramos M.J.H.L.,Molluscan aquaculture in the Philippines: a review,2023,Aquaculture International,31,5,2977,3001,,"Molluscs are among the most valuable resources of the Philippines, an archipelagic country of 7,107 islands bounded by 36,000 km of coastline and 26.6 million ha of coastal waters. In 2020, production from mussels and oysters alone valued at PhP1.552 billion. As primary sources of food and livelihood for marginalized fisherfolk, they are considered important in food security, nutrition, and poverty alleviation. Nevertheless, for almost a century, mollusc culture remained small-scale, with most fish farmers investing in non-fed species, like mussels and oysters. Moreover, mollusc culture in the country is still dependent on wild sources of seed stocks, making production unsustainable and unreliable. This dependence on the wild seed stocks will continue until the issue of the lack of commercial-scale hatcheries or the limited capacity of existing hatcheries to produce seeds, both for top and emerging mollusc aquaculture species, is resolved. Although technologies from broodstock management to post-harvest are available in some species, the lack of capital and the limited government support limit these artisanal fishers from doing large commercial-scale culture. This paper summarizes what has been done and published on the leading mollusc species cultured in the Philippines. Future research activities may be designed based on the research gaps to refine available technologies and develop new ones to improve culture production. The lack of or limited relevant information on the viable economics of the different culture techniques at different culture phases, the limited availability of post-harvest technologies, and the sparse or lack of genetic information for these leading mollusc species are among the gaps that need to be addressed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/s10499-023-01120-9,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85153366438

Abalone viscera, which are normally discarded as byproducts, are a rich source of protein. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the potential bioactivity of peptides derived from abalone viscera (Haliotis fulgens and Haliotis corrugata) after hydrolysis with a commercial mixture of enzymes. The hydrolysates obtained were fractionated using gel filtration chromatography. The resulting hydrolysate fractions were investigated for their antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, including the expression of gelatinases mmp-2 and mmp-9 in human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3). Results showed antimicrobial activity for protein fractions of H. corrugata against Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomona aeuroginosa (66.2–116.25 kDa), Bacillus subtilis (6.5–21.5 kDa), and Aspergillus niger (97.4–116.25 kDa), while H. fulgens peptide fractions (200–31 kDa) displayed activity against six bacterial strains, and fractions from 116.25 to 21.5 kDa had effects on the fungus A. niger, Alternaria alternata, and Aspergillus flavus. Additionally, protein fractions displayed cytotoxic activity, inhibiting 30.4–53.8% of PC3 cellular growth. Selected fractions decreased the PMA-induced and not-induced expressions of mmp-2 and mmp-9 in PC3 cells. Abalone viscera, as byproducts, can be used as a potential source of antimicrobial and anticancer peptides. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",10.1038/s41598-023-41491-w,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85171132547

Undaria pinnatifida is an edible and expensive seaweed conventionally used in abalone diets. The study was conducted to evaluate Sargassum horneri as a substitute for U. pinnatifida in high plant protein diets for juvenile Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus). Dried and ground U. pinnatifida and S. horneri were used for the experiment. Diets were formulated to contain 100 g kg-1 fish meal and 300 g kg-1 seaweed meal. Control diet (SA0) was prepared including 300 g kg-1 U. pinnatifida meal. Three other diets were designed to contain 100, 200, and 300 g kg-1 S. horneri (SA10, SA20, and SA30) by replacing U. pinnatifida meal from control. Triplicate groups of abalones stored in fifteen plastic baskets were hand-fed one of four experimental diets or dried U. pinnatifida once every other day for 16 weeks. Growth performance of abalone fed SA10 and SA20 diets were comparable to SA0 and U. pinnatifida groups. Hemolymph non-specific immune parameters were significantly higher in SA20 group compared to SA0 and U. pinnatifida groups (p ˂ 0.05). Moisture and lipid levels in edible portions of abalone fed S. horneri diets were significantly higher than in control (p ˂ 0.05). Water stability was higher in SA0 diet and gradually decreased with the increase of S. horneri meal in diets. After air exposure, abalone fed S. horneri diets exhibited higher survival than SA0 and U. pinnatifida groups. Therefore, S. horneri can be used to replace U. pinnatifida from abalone diets. The proper combination of U. pinnatifida and S. horneri meal in abalone diet containing a low level of FM appears to be approximately 100 and 200 g kg-1. © 2023",10.1016/j.aqrep.2023.101607,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160551359

Five diets were formulated to contain 0 (CBM0), 25 (CBM25), 50 (CBM 50), 75 (CBM75), and 100% (CBM100) CBM in replacement to 24% fish meal (FM). Dried Saccharina japonica, which is the natural food for this species of abalone was also prepared. Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of abalone. 1260 abalone assigned into eighteen cages were fed for 16 weeks. After the 16-week feeding trial, 30 abalones from each cage were exposed to air for 24 h, and survival was monitored for 7 days. Results showed that weight gain and specific growth rate of abalone fed the CBM0 (185.4 ± 12.83% and 0.93 ± 0.040%/day, respectively) diet were significantly (p < 0.04 for both) higher than those of abalone fed the CBM100 (139.0 ± 6.36% and 0.78 ± 0.024%/day, respectively) diet. Shell length and width of abalone fed the CBM0 diet were significantly (p < 0.003 and p < 0.02, respectively) longer and wider than those of abalone fed the CBM75 and CBM100 diets. Survival of abalone during the 7-day post-observation period after the 24-h air exposure exhibited no remarkable (p > 0.1 for Log Rank and Wilcoxon tests) difference among all formulated diets according to the analysis of the Kaplan–Meier survival curve. In conclusion, CBM can replace FM up to 50% in an abalone diet without compromising growth performance and survival. © 2023 The Authors.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the toxicity of a cocktail of metals released from the dissolution of an aluminium-based galvanic anode (~ 95% Al, ~ 5% Zn) on the abalone Haliotis tuberculata. Juveniles were exposed for 16 weeks (i.e. 12 weeks of exposure and 4 weeks of decontamination phase) and their growth, intake rate, conversion rate and metallic concentrations were monitored. A total of 6 conditions were tested: a control, 4 concentrations based on Al and a trophic control. Results showed that the mortality reached 57% for individuals exposed to 1125 µg L−1 of Al, and the abalone growth significantly decreased for an Al concentration greater than 495 µg L−1. At the highest exposure concentration, intake rate measurements revealed that the appetite of abalones was affected, supported by the large increase in the conversion rate which was indicative of a poor feed efficiency. The monitoring of metallic concentrations showed that H. tuberculata strongly bioconcentrated Al relative to zinc. The diet did not appear to be the primary pathway for metal entry. Concentrations that significantly impacted abalone growth and survival during the experiment were higher than those found in natural environment, but the bioconcentration of Al into the tissues of a primary consumer such as abalone may be a potential pathway for Al to enter food webs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s00244-022-00975-y,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144657280

The cultivated strain of G. lemaneiformis 981 has various advantages over the wild type such as growth rate and high-temperature tolerance. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the differences between the wild-type and cultivated G. lemaneiformis. Here, 648 up-regulated and 837 down-regulated proteins were screened using the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technique, and these differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were concentrated in the pathways including ""Ribosome"", ""Photosynthesis-antenna proteins"", ""alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism"", and ""Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis"". The most prominent pathway was ""Ribosome"", namely, 116 out of 119 ribosome-associated proteins were up-regulated in G. lemaneiformis 981 compared to the wild type. Subsequently, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) validated the credibility of the iTRAQ results. Finally, ""Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis""and ""Photosynthesis-antenna proteins""pathways were also found to be significantly changed in G. lemaneiformis 981 validated by gene expression profiling analysis. Altogether, these results, in combination with chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, unveiled the possible mechanism of differences in growth and anti-abiotic stresses between the wild-type and cultivated G. lemaneiformis, which would provide a reference for breeding of excellent seaweeds.  © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",10.1515/bot-2023-0012,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85174039296

SeNPs enhance immunity, are highly effective against pathogens, and have low toxicity. In this study, SeNPs were prepared using polysaccharide-protein complexes (PSP) from abalone viscera. The acute toxicity of PSP-SeNPs to juvenile Nile tilapia and their effect on growth performance, intestinal tissue structure, antioxidation capacity, hypoxic stress, and Streptococcus agalactiae infection were investigated. The results showed that the spherical PSP-SeNPs were stable and safe, with an LC50 of 13.645 mg/L against tilapia, which was about 13-fold higher than that of sodium selenite (Na2SeO3). A basal diet supplemented with 0.1–1.5 mg/kg PSP-SeNPs improved the growth performance of tilapia juveniles to a certain extent, increased the intestinal villus length, and significantly enhanced the activities of liver antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), and catalase (CAT). PSP-SeNPs also enhanced the resistance of tilapia to hypoxic stress and Streptococcus agalactiae infection, with supplementation at 0.1–0.3 mg/kg exerting more obvious effects than 1.5 mg/kg. However, PSP-SeNPs at a concentration of 4.5 mg/kg and Na2SeO3 at 0.3 mg/kg negatively affected the growth, gut health, and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes of tilapia. Quadric polynomial regression analysis revealed that 0.1–1.2 mg/kg was the optimal PSP-SeNP supplementation concentration for tilapia feeds. The findings of this study lay a foundation for the application of PSP-SeNPs in aquaculture. © 2023",10.1016/j.fsi.2023.108624,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85148671186

However, the effects of pH and water temperature conditions on oxidative stress and apoptosis in disk abalone are poorly understood. This study investigated, for the first time, the effects of different water temperatures (15, 20, and 25 °C) and pH levels (7.5 and 8.1) on oxidative stress and apoptosis in disk abalone by estimating levels of H2O2, malondialdehyde (MDA), dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and the apoptosis-related gene caspase-3. We also visually confirmed apoptotic effects of different water temperatures and pH levels via in situ hybridization and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assays. The levels of H2O2, MDA, SOD, CAT, and caspase-3 increased under low/high water temperature and/or low pH conditions. Expression of the genes was high under high temperature and low pH conditions. Additionally, the apoptotic rate was high under high temperatures and low pH conditions. These results indicate that changes in water temperature and pH conditions individually and in combination trigger oxidative stress in abalone, which can induce cell death. Specifically, high temperatures induce apoptosis by increasing the expression of the apoptosis-related gene caspase-3. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/antiox12051003,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160674731

The CHM included, Scutellariae Radix (Scutellaria baicalensis, Gardeniae Fructus (Gardenia jasminoides), Artemisiae Scopariae Herba (Artemisia capillaris), Uncariae Ramulus Cum Uncis (Uncaria rhynchophylla), Polygoni Cuspidati Rhizoma et Radix (Polygonum cuspidatum). Six diets containing 0.00% (control group), 0.02%, 0.04%, 0.06%, 0.08% and 0.10% of CHM were formulated and fed to abalone (initial weight: 3.59 ± 0.03 g). The group with 0.04% of dietary CHM exhibited the highest weight gain rate (WGR), while the survival was not significantly affected by dietary CHM. The optimal level of dietary CHM for abalone was determined to be 0.049% on the basis of the quadratic regression model for WGR. Dietary CHM significantly elevated the activities of lipase, trypsin, cellulase, Na+/K+-ATPase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and lysozyme and total anti-oxidative capacity. Besides, dietary CHM significantly reduced the malondialdehyde content and alanine amino transferase activity. The mRNA levels of cationic amino acid transporter 1 (cat1) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (nrf2) were significantly up-regulated in the group with 0.04% of dietary CHM. While the mRNA levels of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (keap1), nuclear factor-κb (nf-κb) and tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α) were decreased in dietary CHM supplemented groups. The glucose and cortisol content in the CFH and the falling rate of abalone were significantly lower in the CHM supplemented groups than that in the control group. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of CHM improved the growth performance, anti-oxidative capacity, immunity and the resistance to heat stress of abalone.

We calibrate species-specific parameters of ΦA with physiological measurements for red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and purple urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus). ΦA models highlight that the temperature where oxygen supply is greatest shifts cooler when water loses oxygen or organisms grow larger, providing a mechanistic explanation for observed thermal preference patterns.

The hybrid abalone (Haliotis discus hannai ♀ × H. fulgens ♂, DF), is one of the main varieties of abalone cultured in Fujian Province, China, to resist the high temperature. In this study, the high-temperature resistance of DF abalones was assessed under 28 °C - 32 °C. 31 °C was applied in the subsequent screening experiments of high-temperature resistant individuals. A total of 614,321 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified via super genotyping-by-sequencing (S-GBS), and 69 SNPs involved in 42 candidate genes were identified by genome-wide association study (GWAS). In addition, according to gene functional annotation, the locus with the lowest P value was screened within the threshold range (−log10 P = 4.98296). The genotyping was verified by Sequenom MassARRAY, and 7 SNPs were proved to be related to high temperature resistance in DF population of 100 individuals. 7 candidate genes (fabp, e3rglg4, rgs2, tanc2x6, osbp1, arsb, and uch1) were identified near these SNPs. Finally, these candidate genes were further proved to be associated with the high-temperature resistance trait of DF by the analysis of differential expression genes between sensitive and tolerant individuals. These candidate genes involved regulatory mechanisms such as cell stability, protein repair, lipid metabolism and immune regulation. Notably, the mechanism by which the e3rglg4 gene was involved in the degradation of abnormally folded proteins of abalone under heat stress, corroborating the reliability of the results of GWAS and Sequenom MassARRA.

The feeding experiment, in six replicates, was conducted in a tank facility and lasted for 10 months. At the end of the experiment, abalone fed mixed diets had significantly the highest mean shell length and body weight (45.90±0.19 mm, 22.82±0.31 g), followed by those fed seaweeds (43.47±0.17 mm, 18.25±0.26 g), and lastly, by those fed formulated diets (41.78±0.18 mm, 15.76±0.22 g). Mean growth rates were significantly higher in abalone fed mixed diets at 1.48±0.03 mm and 1.69±0.04 g mo−1 than those fed seaweeds (1.26±0.03 mm, 1.27±0.06 g mo−1) or formulated diet (1.06±0.09 mm, 1.00±0.11 g mo−1). Survival was consistent 1 month from the start of culture until harvest—highest in abalone fed mixed diets (78.81±2.48%), followed by those fed seaweeds (70.12±4.07%), and lastly formulated diet (64.53±4.61%). Moreover, feed conversion ratios (FCR) were significantly lower in abalone fed mixed diets (15.48±0.69) and formulated diet (18.07±3.50) compared with those fed seaweeds (41.31±2.36).

Land-based abalone aquaculture mainly uses commercial feeds (CFs) to promote faster growth, which include FM as a primary protein component. Alternative ingredients, such as insect meal (IM) and grape marc (GM) are potential candidates for FM replacement due to their suitable nutritional profile and sustainable production. This paper reports on a novel nutritional approach for the New Zealand farmed abalone, which replaces FM with IM by 10% and includes a waste by-product (GM) by 30% as a potential prebiotic source. The study was performed in two stages: (a) physico-chemical determination of diets delivered in an alginate matrix (experimental diets) and their stability in seawater compared to CF and (b) evaluation of growth and feed intake for the New Zealand black-foot abalone. There were significant differences between experimental diets and CF in terms of sinking rate, particle weight, and microscopic observations. Water stability of the experimental diets was increased by 50% in 24 and 48 hr compared to CF, producing less solid waste, and potentially reducing cleaning efforts in the farm. The inclusion of IM and GM did not compromise overall animal growth or their feed conversion ratio, however, further evaluation need to be explored in the future research. The findings revealed that the developed encapsulated feeds are a more stable food delivery method for Haliotis iris compared to the CF. Furthermore, both IM and GM can be included in feed formulations as a more sustainable strategy without compromising weight and shell gains in the abalone farming.  © 2023 Natalia Bullon et al.",10.1155/2023/8887768,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85175296675
Gao X.; Lyu M.; Zhang M.; Lin S.; Ke C.,Structural characteristics of orexin receptor type 2 in Pacific abalone and its diurnal expression pattern after fasting and re-feeding,2023,International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,229,,873,884,,"Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) is a typical nocturnal organism. To examine the circadian expression pattern of orexin receptor type 2 (OX2R) and its potential effect on the feeding behavior of abalone, the coding region sequence of OX2R that is 1215 bp in length and encodes 404 amino acids was first cloned using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique. A recombinant expression vector was constructed for H. discus hannai based on the OX2R protein, obtaining a recombinant protein with a molecular weight of 46 kDa. Polyclonal antibody was prepared with the purified recombinant protein used as the antigen, and the antibody titer of ≥512 K was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression levels of OX2R determined using western blotting were highest in the intestinal tract (P < 0.05), but they were not significantly different from the levels in the pedal. Immunofluorescence experiments affirmed that OX2R was widely expressed in the columnar cells of the intestinal mucosal epithelium. To further account for the relationship between the onset of feeding behavior and the expression level of OX2R in abalone, the circadian expression characteristics of OX2R were analyzed by dissecting the intestinal tissues after three days of normal feeding and fasting and following the refeeding treatment. The expression levels of OX2R in the refeeding group were significantly higher than those in the normal feeding and fasting groups at any time point (P < 0.05). The cosine curve analysis revealed that the expression levels of OX2R lost rhythmicity after fasting. Based on the quantification of behavioral data for abalone after fasting and refeeding, the cumulative movement distance and movement duration in each group followed a significant cosine rhythm (P < 0.05), which is consistent with abalone's nocturnal ecological habits. However, the cumulative movement distance and movement duration in the fasting group were significantly lower than those in the normal feeding and refeeding groups (P < 0.05). The peak phases of the cumulative movement distance and movement duration in the refeeding group (ZT08:22 and ZT08:44) shifted backward compared to the normal feeding group (ZT07:33 and ZT07:39). The above results first identified the structural characteristics and circadian expression patterns of OX2R in the marine mollusk abalone, which may reveal the molecular mechanism behind the generation of a feeding rhythm in marine nocturnal organisms and serve as a tool helping to maintain the diversity of marine benthic resources. © 2022",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.12.313,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145983764
Li J.; Xue S.; Mao Y.,Haemolymph pH of two important mollusc species is susceptible to seawater buffering capacity instead of pH or pCO2,2023,Marine Environmental Research,188,,,,106018,"The acid-base status and balance of molluscs are considered to be susceptible to environmental changes, especially in the context of ocean acidification (OA). Here, we studied the effects of manipulated seawater carbonate chemistry on the acid-base status of scallop Chlamys farreri and abalone Haliotis discus hannai. The haemolymph pH of the tested individuals showed a fast response to acidified seawater incubation, and the pH level was restored to a normal value within 1 h of recovery in control seawater. However, no significant correlation (P > 0.05) was found between haemolymph pH and seawater pCO2 or pH, while the squared Pearson correlation coefficient (R2) ranged from close to zero to 0.41. In addition, although the pCO2 level of total alkalinity (TA)-lowered seawater was lower than half of that in the control, molluscs eliminated less CO2 (less than 80%) to TA lowered waters than to the control waters. These findings seem to disagree with the crucial role of seawater pCO2 in influencing the acid-base balance of molluscs. CO2 elimination occurs in the microenvironment, and CO2 first diffuses to limited amounts of seawater that tightly surround the gills, causing dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) accumulation in the ventilation sites, which leads to a sharp increase in the pCO2 of the surrounding seawater. Moreover, in this microenvironment, the pCO2 level increases much faster and more greatly if the environmental seawater is acidified or contains a lower level of TA. Therefore, mollusc acid-base status is influenced by rapidly varying pCO2 levels at the ventilation site, which is largely independent of that of the rest of the incubating seawater. In summary, CO2 elimination by molluscs relies heavily on the carbonate chemistry of environmental seawater, and seawater buffering capacity should be taken into consideration instead of considering only pCO2 or pH in studying the acid-base balance of marine molluscs. © 2023",10.1016/j.marenvres.2023.106018,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85156136435
Hanif M.A.; Hossen S.; Cho D.H.; Kho K.H.,"The Neuropeptide HGAP Regulates Growth, Reproduction, Metamorphosis, Tissue Damage Repair, and Response against Starvation in Pacific Abalone",2023,Neuroendocrinology,114,5,453,467,,"Introduction: Neuropeptides regulate vital physiological processes in multicellular organisms, including growth, re- production, metamorphosis, and feeding. Recent tran- scriptome analyses have revealed neuropeptide genes with potential roles in vertebrate and invertebrate growth and reproduction. Among these genes, haliotid growth- associated peptide (HGAP) was identified as a novel gene in abalone. Methods: This study focused on HGAP in Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), where the complete cDNA sequence named Hdh-HGAP was identified and character- ized. Samples from different experiments, such as meta- morphosis, juvenile abalone growth, gonad development stages, muscle remodeling, and starvation, were collected for mRNA expression analysis. Results: The sequence spans 552 bp, encoding 96 amino acids with a molecular weight of 10.96 kDa. Expression analysis revealed that Hdh-HGAP ex- hibited higher levels in muscle tissue. Notably, during metamorphosis, Hdh-HGAP exhibited greater expression in the trochophore, veliger, and juvenile stages than in the cell division stages. Regarding growth patterns, Hdh-HGAP was highly expressed during rapid growth compared to stunted, minimal, and normal growth. In gonadal development, Hdh- HGAP mRNA reached its highest expression level during the ripening stage, indicating a potential role in gonadal cell proliferation and maturation. The in vivo effects of GnRH on gonad development and the expression of the Hdh-HGAP neuropeptide indicate its involvement in regulating repro- duction in Pacific abalone. While tissue remodeling is pri- marily governed by immune genes, Hdh-HGAP was also upregulated during muscle tissue remodeling. Conversely, Hdh-HGAP was downregulated during prolonged starvation. Conclusion: This study marks the first comprehensive ex- ploration of the Hdh-HGAP neuropeptide gene in Pacific abalone, shedding light on its involvement in growth, re- production, metamorphosis, tissue remodeling, and re- sponse to starvation, although regulatory mechanisms are mostly unknown. © 2023 S.

Unpredictable water temperature fluctuations, especially those caused by climate change, may negatively affect feed consumption and growth of cultured organisms, such as abalone. In addition, metabolic and nutritional changes across different seasons may have significant effects on aquaculture production. This study aimed to investigate biochemical and metabolic alterations in healthy abalone (Haliotis iris) during 1 year of grow out in a land-based farm in New Zealand. Proximate analyses were used to identify nutritional variations in whole animal tissues, and a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach was used to identify metabolic changes in adductor muscle of abalone during different seasons in the 1-year sampling period. Results showed that protein content was higher in warmer months compared with colder months, whereas lipid, ash, and carbohydrate contents remained generally constant throughout the year. Metabolic profile fluctuations indicated higher amounts of glutamic acid, glutathione, methionine, lysine, serine, tyrosine, and glycine in January and March compared with October and July, indicating possible amino acid breakdown and collagen degradation due to warmer temperatures. Although the proximate analyses findings revealed no signs of nutritional deficiencies in abalone among seasons, the metabolic profiles suggested possible thermal stress during summer months. This study provides a foundation for further nutritional studies to optimise seasonal diets for farmed Haliotis iris and highlights the need to monitor thermal stress effects, especially during summer and/or heatwave events.

Abalones were divided into two groups: eyestalk-ablated (EA) and control (C), and were cultured for 60 days. Results showed that the EA group exhibited significantly higher growth rates in body weight compared to the C group. However, the EA group also had a higher mortality rate, indicating the negative consequences of eyestalk ablation. The feeding rate was significantly higher in the EA group, especially during nocturnal feeding, suggesting that eyestalk ablation may specifically affect nocturnal feeding behavior in abalone. Both EA and C groups displayed rhythmic oscillations in movement activity, with no significant differences in mesor and amplitude. Nevertheless, the peak of populational movement proportion in the EA group occurred approximately 2 h earlier than that in the C group. Transcriptome analysis identified 417 circadian genes, with the most significant enrichment found in the growth-related thyroid hormone signaling pathway. The expression of five core clock genes (clock, cry, rho, tipin, per) exhibited significant circadian rhythms in H. discus hannai, while their rhythmic oscillation significance was weaker in the EA group, except for the tipin transcript. These findings reveal that eyestalk ablation affects growth, feeding and locomotor behavior, and clock gene expression in abalone, providing valuable insights for understanding the circadian regulatory mechanisms and physiological ecological adaptations of abalone. However, due to its harmful effects on animal welfare and the limited promotion of growth, this technology is not advocated for use in aquaculture practices. © 2023 The Authors",10.1016/j.aqrep.2023.101807,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85175490089

Six isoenergetic and isolipidic diets containing graded levels of protein (15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, and 40%) were fed to the hybrid abalone for 90 days. Based on the specific growth rate, the optimum dietary protein levels for adult hybrid abalone using a quadratic curve model were estimated to be 28.07% and 26.47% of the diet at 23 °C (optimum temperature) and 27 °C (high temperature), respectively. The amount of crude protein in the abalone body increased linearly with the dietary protein levels and water temperature. Antioxidation enzyme activities of abalone muscle, including GPx and GST were significantly affected by the interaction of dietary protein levels and water temperature. As for texture analysis, the abalone kept at 23 °C exhibited higher meat hardness than those fed the same diets at 27 °C. The n-3 PUFAs (particularly DHA and EPA) in abalone meat were significantly influenced by dietary protein levels, and the highest content was observed in the 30% dietary protein group. These levels were not affected by water temperature. In addition, higher dietary protein levels and water temperatures increased the total contents of free amino acids and flavor amino acids (Asp + Glu + Gly + Ala + Arg + Tau). The cooking loss of abalone meat was reduced with increased protein levels and was significantly lower in the 23 °C group, along with a higher meat postmortem pH value. The collagen fiber ratio and collagen content of abalone meat were higher in the 23 °C group. In summary, for multiple diet feeding strategies in practical production of abalone aquaculture, the balance between the seasonally specific feeds cost benefits and the abalone meat quality should be carefully evaluated. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739907,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166555616

Abalone muscle digestion products (AMDP) were prepared by subjecting dried abalone to in vitro simulated digestion. Our aim was to investigate the effect of microwave treatment during the drying of abalone muscle on the in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activities of AMDP. The results showed that the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of AMDP from fresh abalone muscle for scavenging capacity against hydroxyl (·OH) radicals, N,N-dimethylp-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (DMPD) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-phenylhydrazine (DPPH) radical were 3.04, 15.18 and 21.12 mg/mL, respectively. The IC50 values for the scavenging of these three radical species decreased gradually with increasing the drying time of abalone muscle. After being fed AMDP from abalone muscle dried for 120 days, the body length of Caenorhabditis elegans increased from 768.90 to 1 034.62 μm, the head swing frequency increased from 206 to 281 times/min, and the life span was extended by 36.16% under normal conditions and by 59.41% and 38.48% under heat stress and oxidative stress conditions, respectively compared with the control group. Meanwhile, with prolonging the drying time of abalone muscle, the antioxidant enzyme activities, reduced glutathione (GSH) content and total antioxidant capacity of C. elegans fed AMDP increased, and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content decreased. In summary, prolonging the drying time and using microwave treatment during the drying process could improve the antioxidant capacity of AMDP. © 2023 Chinese Chamber of Commerce.

Antibiotic resistance in gut microbiota has been extensively researched. The effects of cadmium (Cd) was investigated on the gut microbiota and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) of Haliotis diversicolor, a commercially important abalone species. By exposing H. diversicolor to four concentrations of Cd (0 μg L−1 (control), 6.5 μg L−1 (low), 42.25 μg L−1 (medium), and 274.63 μg L−1 (high)) for 30 and 60 days, 16 types of ARG (aadA-01, aadA-02, cfr, dfrA1, ermB, floR, folA, mecA, sul2, tetB-01, tetC-01, tetD-01, tetG-01, tetM-02, tetQ, vanC-01), and 1213 genus and 27 phylum microbiomes were detected. ARGs can be resistant to aminoglycoside, beta-lactamase, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B, multidrug, florfenicol, macrolide, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and vancomycin. Cadmium exposure significantly alters the abundance of tetC-01, tetB-01, tetQ, sul2, and aadA-01. About 5% (61) of genus-level microorganisms were significantly affected by Cd exposure. Microbiota alpha and beta diversities in the 60-day 42.25 μg L−1 Cd treatment differed significantly from those in other treatments. In addition, 26 pathogens were detected, and two pathogens (Vibrio and Legionella) were significantly affected by Cd exposure. Significant correlations between pathogens and ARGs increased with increased Cd concentration after 60 days of Cd exposure. Cadmium exposure may cause gut microbiota disturbance in H. diversicolor and increase the likelihood of ARG transfer to pathogens, increasing potential ecological and economic risks. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.141507,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85185825128

To address such demands, new aquafeed technologies have been developed relying on natural and artificial ingredients that are commercially viable. In addition, current global sustainable initiatives require feed technologies to reduce the pressure on limited wild fisheries and minimize negative environmental effects. Although there are numerous studies on abalone nutrition, most tend to focus on animal growth and nutrient utilization. A more holistic research approach to ensure a sustainable future for this industry will require the development of feeds that provide integrated nutrition and health benefits. In this review, we aim to synthesize the most recent scientific literature on the nutritional and health benefits and shortcomings of two main abalone feeding approaches (seaweed and formulated feeds) within aquaculture production practices.

Abalones (initial weight: 16.19 ± 0.16 g) were fed with graded levels of dietary phospholipids (0.10 %, 0.30 %, 0.69 %, 1.30 %, 1.83 % and 2.48 %). Results showed that weight gain rate (WGR) were highest in 1.83 % dietary phospholipids level. Based on the quadratic regression analysis for WGR, the optimal dietary phospholipids level for abalone was estimated to be 1.57 %. The contents of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in abalone muscle increased gradually with the increase of dietary phospholipids levels. A total of 25 volatile flavor compounds were detected in the muscle of abalone by gas chromatograph-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS), including 9 aldehydes, 6 esters, 4 ketones, 3 alcohols and 3 hydrocarbons. The content of some volatile flavor compounds with pleasant aroma in the muscle of abalone increased significantly when fed with diets containing 1.83 % and 2.48 % of phospholipids. Lipidomics analysis showed that dietary phospholipids could affect the lipid composition in the muscle by reducing the synthesis and promoting the decomposition of phospholipids. Among 244 differential lipids identified by lipidomics, phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) were the main species, accounting for more than 50 % of them. Partial least squares regression (PLS-R) analysis showed that the changes of volatile flavor compounds in the muscle of abalone was strongly related to PCs and PEs. Altogether, the present study suggested that dietary phospholipids can not only improve the growth performance and nutritional value of abalone, but also have the potential to improve the flavor quality of abalone. © 2023 The Authors",10.1016/j.aqrep.2023.101567,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85153116403
Sun D.; Zhou X.; Sun X.; Xu N.,Transcriptomic analysis reveals the regulatory mechanism of tetraspore formation in Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis,2023,Frontiers in Marine Science,9,,,,1080474,"With the expansion of seaweed culture and changes in the global climate, large quantities of new seaweed germplasm are urgently needed. It is important to elucidate the process of reproductive development and its regulatory mechanism in seaweed. Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis (Rhodophyta) has an essential economic and ecological value, for example, as a raw material for agar extraction and abalone feed. Here, four phases (I to IV) of G. lemaneiformis tetrasporophyte development were analyzed using physiological assays and transcriptome technologies. The results showed that photosynthetic capacity increased during the period from tetraspore formation to the release (Phase II, III and IV). According to transcriptome results, the expression levels of genes associated with light harvesting, photosynthesis, and carbon fixation pathways were significantly upregulated during tetraspore formation and release. Meanwhile, the expression levels of genes encoding starch and trehalose synthesis enzymes in starch and sucrose metabolism were enhanced during tetraspore formation and release, suggesting that G. lemaneiformis requires more energy supply during reproductive development, and that trehalose-6-phosphate may also act as a signaling molecule to induce tetraspore formation. In addition, genes encoding antioxidant enzymes (APX, TRX, GR, TR, PRX, and CAT) were significantly upregulated during tetraspore formation. These results may help us to understand the transition from nutritional to reproductive development and the molecular mechanism of G. lemaneiformis tetrasporogenesis, which is vital for the development of new germplasm and promoting the growth of the seaweed culture industry.

Temperature is a crucial environmental factor influencing abalone's physiology and energetics, leading to a change in nutritional requirements. However, feeds are generally formulated to match the nutritional requirements at their optimal temperature. Hence, there is a need to optimise dietary protein levels to match temperature-specific requirements during extreme conditions (winter and summer). Given this, a growth trial evaluating five experimental feeds consisting of graded protein inclusion levels (320, 350, 380, 410, and 440 g·kg-1) was conducted on subadult hybrid abalone (Haliotis rubra × H. laevigata) at three different temperatures reflecting winter (12°C), summer (22°C), and the annual average water temperature (17°C) for 143 days. At lower water temperature (12°C), there was a marginal improvement in growth performance as dietary protein levels increased from 320 to 440 g·kg-1. However, at higher water temperatures (when the culture water temperature is above 17°C), there was a significant improvement in growth performance as dietary protein levels increased from 320 to 440 g·kg-1 as evidenced by an improved weight gain, specific growth rate, and feed conversion ratio. Furthermore, increasing dietary protein levels did not compromise the nutritional quality of the abalone tissue at all three tested temperatures. Therefore, during periods of higher water temperatures, feeding Australian hybrid abalone with a relatively high dietary protein level (410 g·kg-1) is expected to result in improved growth, shorter culture duration, and profit maximisation.  © 2023 Abdul Lathiff Inamul Hassan et al.",10.1155/2023/1676340,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160087742

To facilitate the restoration of wild stocks of Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) and increase the success rate of release, abalones were monitored for 24 h without interruption in an experimental unit (developed in-house) to assess the flow velocity preferences of marine mollusks. Abalones tended to keep away from areas with higher flow velocities (> 5 cm/s) and they preferred to stay in areas with lower flow velocities (< 5 cm/s). Comparative study of the diurnal behavioral characteristics of abalones under seven different flow velocities (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 cm/s) showed that the cumulative distance moved, movement duration, and feeding time decreased significantly as the flow velocity increased. At flow velocities over 20 cm/s, abalones barely moved or consumed food, and cosine rhythm analysis demonstrated that the diurnal rhythms of behavioral parameters disappeared and the peak movement phase occurred earlier than expected. In addition, increasing the flow velocity reduced the spacing between individuals and the polarity of movement was higher. Individuals changed their coordination levels in groups as an active adaptation to changes in the flow velocity. These findings provide new insights into the ecological habits of abalones. Based on the characteristic movement behaviors of abalones at different flow velocities, bottom-sowing should be conducted in areas with a flow velocity < 5 cm/s instead of areas with a flow velocity > 20 cm/s to improve the efficiency of bottom-sowing stock enhancement. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.gecco.2024.e02823,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85183872212

Restricted by the level of comprehensive utilization technology, the utilization rate of shells is extremely low, resulting in serious waste and pollution. The research shows that the unique brick-mud structure of shells makes them have diverse and good functional characteristics, which guides them to have great utilization potential in different fields. Hence, this review highlights the constitutive relationship between microstructure-function-application of shells (e.g., gastropods, cephalopods, and amniotes), and the comprehensive applications and development ideas in the fields of biomedicine, adsorption enrichment, pHotocatalysis, marine carbon sink, and environmental deicer. It is worth mentioning that marine shells are currently well developed in three areas: bone repair, health care and medicinal value, and drug carrier, which together promote the progress of biomedical field. In addition, an in-depth summary of the application of marine shells in the adsorption and purification of various impurities such as crude oil, heavy metal ions and dyes at low-cost and high efficiency is presented.

In this study, the MyD88 gene from the Haliotis diversicolor (hdMyD88) was identified. The full-length cDNA of hdMyD88 has a 1927 base pairs (bp), with an open reading frame of 1314 bp encoding 437 amino acids including a death domain (DD) at the N-terminus and TIR domain at the C-terminus which are typical features of MyD88 family proteins. Three conserved boxes are also found in the hdMyD88, which are similar to MyD88 in vertebrates. The expression levels of hdMyD88 mRNA at different early embryonic developmental stages of abalone were measured by qPCR revealed that their constitutive expression at all developmental stages analyzed with the considerably highest values at 8 cell stage and the lowest level at the trochosphere stage. Additionally, the mRNA expression of hdMyD88 decreased significantly (P < 0.05) after MyD88-dsRNA soak in the stage of trochosphere and veliger than EGFP-dsRNA group and blank control group. Whole embryo in situ hybridization showed that the positive signals of hdMyD88 were in visceral mass of trochophore larvae and veliger larvae.

Bautista López R.Z.; Yáñez Mendiola J.; Sicard González M.T.,Branchial Motion Assessment in Abalone Using Photoplethysmography,2023,Aquaculture Research,2023,,,,6672198,"The abalone, a gastropod mollusk belonging to the Haliotidae family, has been a subject of research with a focus on its behavior in response to various environmental factors, including temperature fluctuations and hypoxia. While existing studies have primarily explored abalone behavior in relation to environmental changes, there remains a significant amount to be discovered regarding their behavioral patterns. There are studies in which recordings of readings have been made (indirect methods) of the heart rate of the abalone since it is believed that it is one of the parameters affected due to the changes in temperature and dissolved oxygen in its environment. The main disadvantage of some procedures to measure heart rate in abalone is that an incision is made near the heart, through this incision the measurement is made using the photoplethysmography technique. Another parameter that is affected by these changes (temperature and hypoxia) is respiratory rate. Temperature is an important factor that can reduce oxygen solubility and thus alter abalone respiration; so in this work, we propose to use the technique of photoplethysmography: a method involving the measurement of changes in volume within a biological organ, which offers a unique opportunity to monitor these changes. We adapt this technique to measure gill movements in abalone, a critical indicator of respiratory activity in these marine mollusks. By utilizing a pulse oximetry setup and synchronous detection, we establish an innovative approach to gill movement analysis. This approach employs a pulse train and synchronous demodulation technique, the train of pulses is guided through an optical fiber to one of the respiratory orifices of the abalone to effectively detect and analyze the gill movements of abalone. Additionally, the role of frequency of its gill movements is highlighted as another critical variable of interest within the broader study of Haliotis fulgens, shedding light on the multifaceted nature of abalone behavior and responses to their surroundings.

High water temperature (>24 °C) is widely accepted as a key contributor to elevated summer mortality. High crude protein levels in modern abalone diets may interact with elevated water temperature to produce detrimental effects on abalone physiological processes but have received scant attention. This study measured the energy used in the digestion, absorption, and assimilation (i.e., specific dynamic action (SDA)) of hybrid abalone (Haliotis laevigata x H. rubra) after four months of acclimation to three protein levels (32, 38 and 44%) at three culture temperatures (12, 17 and 22 °C). Hybrid abalone exhibited significant stepwise increases in meal size as temperature increased from 12 through to 22 °C, contributing to significantly different SDA between the temperature treatments. Resting (standard) aerobic metabolic rate and peak metabolism (peak ṀO) during SDA both increased with temperature, while SDA duration was lowest at 17 °C. No effect of dietary protein was observed within the temperature treatments for the SDA metrics. Abalone held at 12 °C exhibited significantly higher rates of gonad maturation, particularly among females. When 22 °C-acclimated abalone were exposed to a simulated summer heatwave up to 26 °C, they exhibited similar mortality and metabolic responses across protein treatment groups and there was a trend of steadily decreasing ṀO with sustained 26 °C water temperature, probably due to fasting. These results help to inform best farming practices to ensure optimal diet, growth, metabolic performance, and survival of hybrid abalone in the dynamic farm environment. © 2023",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.740185,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85173273508

Cell engineering breeding is an important tool in abalone genetic breeding, and the triploids obtained through this method have high commercial value. However, current research mainly focuses on establishing induction methods and evaluating the growth traits of triploids, while there is a lack of basic research on triploid cytogenetics. Method: In this study, Cytogenetic analysis of triploid Haliotis discus hannai larvae (produced by chemical treatment) and diploid larvae was performed. Result: The results showed that triploid H. discus hannai had a chromosome number of 3n = 54, consisting of 30 metacentric (m) and 24 submetacentric (sm) chromosomes, while the diploids had a chromosome number of 2n = 36, consisting of 20 metacentric (m) and 16 submetacentric (sm) chromosomes. Notably, both triploids and diploids displayed variation in the number of NORs and/or their diameter. The average number of NORs in triploid was significantly higher than that in diploids (p < 0.05), but the average diameter of NORs of triploid was no significant different from that of diploid (p > 0.05). Additionally, 5S rDNA localization to 3 submetacentric chromosomes was observed in triploids, compared to 2 submetacentric chromosomes in diploids. The number of 18S rDNA sites displayed positional conservancy and quantitative variability in both diploids and triploids. Specifically, 18S rDNA was found at the end of the chromosome in both groups, with triploids exhibiting a significantly higher number of loci than diploids (p < 0.01). Conclusion: This study provides valuable insights into the cytogenetic characteristics of triploid H. discus hannai, which could facilitate further research on the stability of the chromosome set in this species.  © 2023 S.

The goal of this study is to look into the causes of non-enzymatic browning and lipid oxidation, as well as how to control them, and their effect on the color of RTE abalone during storage. The control, bloodletting and antioxidants groups (lactic acid, citric acid and 4-hexylresorcinol) of RTE abalone were stored for 0, 20 and 40 days at 40 °C, respectively, to explore the rule and mechanism of the color change in RTE abalone. This research shows that RTE abalone undergoes browning during storage. Meanwhile, the content of reducing sugar, phenols and unsaturated fatty acids decreases, while the formation of lipid hydroperoxides and aldehydes increases during storage. In addition, the color change in RTE abalone during storage is mainly related to the Maillard reaction, while the lipid oxidation mainly forms pyrrole and participates in the Strecker degradation process as part of the Maillard reaction. The quality of RTE abalone can be maintained by controlling browning effectively as well as lipid oxidation through bloodletting and the addition of antioxidants to ensure that RTE abalone has high storage stability. According to our research, bloodletting and the addition of antioxidants to RTE abalone have a good application prospect and popularizing value in the storage of RTE abalone. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/foods12071514,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85152776719

Thus, the present study conducted a monthly epidemiological survey for 4 years on adult scallops ear-hung from 2017 to 2020 on a scallop farm in northern Japan. As a result, the prevalence of F. halioticida in low temperature period increased for all year groups, but any association with scallop mortality was recognized. On the other hand, in the 2017–2019 year groups, increase of the prevalence and rapid declines of scallop survival were recognized in high-temperature periods. Additionally, overall survival in these year groups were apparently lower than the 2020 year group without increase of the prevalence in high-temperature period, suggesting that infection of F. halioticida in high-temperature periods may be associated with mortality of scallops. Abscess lesions in the adductor muscle were found to be associated with F. halioticida infection, but not always formed in infected scallops. Thus, presence of abscess lesions may serve as an indicator for francisellosis, but not necessarily a definitive symptom for this disease. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.740092,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85171479044
Lei K.; Cui Z.; Liu C.; Sahandi J.; Rao W.; Chen P.; Mai K.; Zhang W.,"Dietary arachidonic acid affects the growth performance, fatty acid profile, immunity and resistance to heat stress in juvenile abalone Haliotis discus hannai Ino",2023,Aquaculture,575,,,,739776,"A 93-day feeding trial was performed to evaluate the effects of dietary arachidonic acid (ARA) on the growth performance, antioxidative capacity, immunity and anti-stress capacity of juvenile abalone Haliotis discus hannai Ino with an initial mean body weight of 4.26 ± 0.11 g. Six practical diets with 0.04% (the control), 0.31%, 0.44%, 0.68%, 0.94% and 1.34% of ARA were designed. After the feeding trial, abalones were subjected to a heat stress test. The findings showed that the survival of abalone (91.7–96.7%) after the feeding trial was not significantly influenced by dietary ARA. The 0.31–0.44% of dietary ARA significantly increased the weight gain rate (WGR). The feed conversion ratio (FCR) was decreased by 0.31–0.68% of dietary ARA. The 0.44% of dietary ARA significantly enhanced the activity of trypsin, lipase and α-amylase in the intestine. Besides, dietary ARA supplementation significantly elevated the total antioxidative capacity and activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase and lysozyme in the cell-free hemolymph. Higher levels of dietary ARA (≥0.94%) significantly up-regulated the mRNA levels of nuclear factor κB, inhibitor of κBα and transcription factor AP-1 in the digestive gland. The 0.68% of dietary ARA significantly decreased the falling rate of abalone after heat stress. In conclusion, appropriate dietary ARA levels improved the growth performance and feed utilization of abalone. The optimal dietary ARA content for juvenile abalone was 0.52% based on the quadratic regression analysis of WGR. The 0.44–0.68% of dietary ARA improved the antioxidative capacity, immunity and anti-heat stress of abalone. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739776,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85161649366

This study aims to investigate the effect of an encapsulated probiotics feed on the growth and health of New Zealand black-footed abalone (Haliotis iris). Juvenile abalone were fed with four different dietary treatments, including commercial pellets, commercial feed sprayed with probiotics, combination of commercial feed and chitosan-coated alginate (CCALG) beads containing probiotics and CCALG beads containing both probiotics and nutrients. A multi-technique approach was used to evaluate the growth performance and health parameters of the experimental animals after 57 days in feeding trial. The results showed a significantly higher growth rate (p < 0.05) in shell length (50.06 ± 5.91 µm/day) and weight (25.55 ± 2.55 mg/day) of abalone fed with CCALG beads containing both probiotics and nutrients (optimal diet) compared to the other groups. The feed conversion rate (FCR) for abalone fed with the optimal diet (1.04 ± 0.06) was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than the other experimental diets. Furthermore, a low level of haemocytes with reactive oxygen species (ROS) was found associated with the optimal diet (13.24 ± 4.2%). A total of 31 differently regulated metabolites across the four treatments were revealed with a characteristic enhancement of free amino acids in the samples obtained from abalone fed with the optimal diet. The combined results from the growth parameters, flowcytometry and metabolomics indicate that CCALG beads encapsulating probiotics and nutrients can efficiently improve the growth and immunity of juvenile abalone. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2023.115639,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85150254301
Liu J.; Zhu S.; Jiang H.; Liang Y.; Wu S.; Li Z.,Modification of calcium sulfate hemihydrate composite bone cement by abalone shell; [鲍鱼壳对半水硫酸钙复合骨水泥的改性],2023,Gongneng Cailiao/Journal of Functional Materials,54,11,11022,11029,,"Calcium sulfate hemihydrate composite bone cement has been widely used in clinic because of its good plasticity and in situ self-curing properties. However, its degradation products are acidic and not conducive to subsequent bone tissue regeneration. The main component of abalone shell is calcium carbonate, which can effectively regulate the pH of the microenvironment after bone cement degradation. Because it contains organic factors and trace elements, it greatly improves the biocompatibility of bone cement. In this paper, by adding abalone shell to the bone cement, the injectable property could be increased to 97.20%±0.28%. This is mainly due to the addition of abalone shell powder, which affected the hydration process of the bone cement and prolongated the setting time (up to 26.93 士 0.31 min). On the other hand, abalone shell powder inhibited the growth of calcium sulfate hemihydrate crystals, which made the calcium sulfate hemihydrate crystals smaller (from 1.42 士 0.77 μm to 0.90 士 0.36 μm) in composite bone cement, and effectively alleviated the decrease of pH during the degradation of composite bone cement (from 6.08 士 0.06 to 6.93 士 0.02). The cell survival rate was greatly improved from 87.00% ± 1.60% to 96.41%±1.44%. Therefore, this study indicates that the addition of abalone shell is a potentially effective means to improve the biocompatibility of bone cement in clinical practice. © 2023 Journal of Functional Materials.

Wu Z.; Yu X.; Fu Y.; Guo J.; Pan M.; Guo Y.; Liu J.; Mai K.; Zhang W.,"Impacts of replacing dietary fish meal with poultry by-product meal on growth, digestive enzymes and gut microbiota, biomarkers of metabolic and immune response, and resistance to Vibrio challenge in abalone (Haliotis discus hannai)",2023,Aquaculture,576,,,,739871,"A 110-day feeding trial was carried out to investigate the impacts of replacing dietary fish meal (FM) with poultry by-product meal (PBM) on growth performance, digestion, gut microbiota, immunity, and disease resistance of abalone Haliotis discus hannai (initial weight: 22.53 ± 0.21 g). The control diet (PBM0) without PBM contained 20% of FM. Based on PBM0, the other four isonitrogenous (about 30% of crude protein) and isolipidic (about 4% of crude lipid) diets were formulated replacing 25, 50, 75 and 100% of FM by PBM (designated as PBM25, PBM50, PBM75 and PBM100), respectively. Every diet was fed to triplicate cages (40 × 35 × 70 cm) with 60 abalones per cage. At the end of the feeding trial, abalones were starved for 3 days and anesthetized with 5% ethanol before sampling. Results indicated that biomass gain of the abalone fed PBM75 (916.71 g) and PBM100 (659.93 g) was significantly lower than that of the abalone fed PBM0 (1222.51 g). Feed conversion ratio of the abalone fed PBM50 (2.93), PBM75 (2.89) and PBM100 (4.04) were significantly higher than that of the abalone fed PBM0 (2.37). The muscle crude protein content of the abalone fed PBM100 (16.01% wet weight) was significantly lower than that of the abalone fed PBM0 (16.67% wet weight). Activities of trypsin and α-amylase in the digestive gland in the PBM100 group (309.21 and 0.064 U/mg prot., respectively) were significantly lower than the PBM0 group (463.57 and 0.078 U/mg prot., respectively). When the substitution levels rose over 50%, expressions of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, threonine kinase/protein B, mammalian target of rapamycin and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E in muscle were significantly reduced, while 4E binding protein was significantly increased. The most abundant phyla across the abalones' gut were Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Catalase (from 2.90 to 1.69 U/mL), superoxide dismutase (from 98.93 to 74.39 U/mL), lysozyme (from 345.86 to 247.81 U/mL) and acid phosphatase (from 21.68 to 15.71 U/100 mL) activities in cell-free hemolymph were markedly decreased with substitution level increasing. When the replacement levels rose over 50%, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 and tumor necrosis factor α expressions in the digestive gland were markedly upregulated, while β-defensin and mytimacin 6 expressions were markedly downregulated. The cumulative mortality of abalone challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus (1.0 × 107 CFU/mL) for 7 days was remarkably increased in the PBM50 (83.49%), PBM75 (89.56%) and PBM100 (100%) groups compared with the PBM0 group (58.82%). In conclusion, 50% of dietary FM could be replaced by PBM without influencing abalone growth. When the replacement level was over 50%, the growth and immunity of abalone were decreased, and the mTOR pathway was negatively affected. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739871,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85165999454

One thousand and two hundred sixty abalones were randomly assigned into 18 cages (3 cages/diet; 70 abalone/cage). Two hundred g/kg of S. japonica was included in the control diet (BBP0). The BBP250, BBP500, BBP750, and BBP1000 diets were prepared by substituting 250, 500, 750, and 1000 g/kg of S. japonica with an equal amount of BBP. Additionally, dry S. japonica was prepared. Abalone were fed daily for 7 days a week for 16 weeks. Following the completion of the feeding trial, 20 abalone from each cage were exposed to air for 20 h prior to being monitored for the following 5 days. The greatest weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) were achieved in abalone fed the BBP250 diet. Superior survival was obtained in abalone fed the BBP250, BBP500, BBP750, and BBP1000 diets to abalone fed the S. japonica control diet. The BBP250 and BBP500 diets achieved the highest survival of abalone. BBP appears to be a novel replacer for S. japonica in abalone diets, and 250 g/kg replacement of BBP for S. japonica produced the best weight gain and SGR. © 2023 The Authors.

This study aimed to establish a method for the analysis of 52 PFASs in typical aquatic products, such as crucian carp, large yellow croaker, shrimp, and clam, by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) after automated solid phase extraction (SPE). After optimization of the conditions of SPE, the recovery and precision of the method is within an acceptable range. The intra-day and inter-day average recoveries of spiked samples ranged from 66.5% to 122.3% and 64.5%-128.0% for crucian carp, large yellow croaker, shrimp, and clam, with intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviation (RSD) of 0.78%-11.4%, and 2.54%-24.2%. The ranges of method detection limits (MDLs) and quantification limits (MQLs) of PFASs were 0.003–0.60 ng/g and 0.005–2.0 ng/g, respectively. The accuracy of the method was also verified by standard reference material (SRM), and the measured values of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were in the allowable range. The method was applied to analyze aquatic products from the local supermarket. The concentrations of ∑PFASs ranged from 13.9 ng/g ww to 75.5 ng/g ww. PFOS was the dominant pollutant, accounting for 79.6% of ∑PFASs. The branch-chain isomers, perfluoro-3-methylheptane sulfonate (P3MHpS) and perfluoro-6-methylheptane sulfonate (P6MHpS) accounted for one-quarter of PFOS. Long-chain perfluoro carboxylic acids (PFCAs) were also detected in most samples. The estimated daily intake of PFOS was over the recommended tolerable intake by several organizations such as the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), the New Jersey Drinking Water Quality Institute (NJDWQI), and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).

Chen W.; Zhang Y.; Lu J.; Xu N.; Sun X.,Effects of trehalose on the physiological parameters and gene expression of high-temperature stressed Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis; [海藻糖对高温胁迫龙须菜的生理及基因表达的影响],2024,Journal of Fisheries of China,48,6,,,69605,"Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis is a kind of cultivated seaweed with the second highest production in China, which is mainly used to feed abalone and extract agar, but its yield and cultivated period are limited due to the high temperature of the summer in the southern coast. As a signaling molecule, non-reducing disaccharide trehalose plays an important role in enduring high temperature, drought and other adverse stresses. To explore the role and mechanism of trehalose in the stress resistance of G. lemaneiformis, this paper investigated the effects of exogenous trehalose on the growth, stress resistance-related substances, metabolic enzymes, endogenous salicylic acid and related genes under high temperature stress using physiological and biochemical test, HPLC-MS/MS and real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). The results showed that application of 10 mmol/L trehalose promoted the algal growth and proline content of G. lemaneiformis with 0.34-fold (3 d) and 0.30-fold increases (24 h) compared to the control, respectively. Meanwhile, trehalose significantly activated the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and the activities of superoxide dismutase and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, but malonaldehyde content and lipoxidase (LOX) activity were reduced. Moreover, trehalose significantly stimulated the activity and gene expression of isochorismate synthase, the key enzyme in salicylic acid biosynthesis, and the accumulation of salicylic acid (2.05-fold). Finally, supplementation with trehalose could maintain the stable increase of the gene expression level of heat shock protein 70, while the lox2 gene expression was downregulated at 12 h. All of these results revealed that trehalose could promote algal growth through scavenging the reactive oxygen species, alleviating the lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane, enhancing the accumulation of osmolytes and phytohormones and so on. This study verifies that exogenous trehalose plays a vital role in resisting high temperature, which will provide a reference for future breeding efforts to improve the stress resistance of G. lemaneiformis.

Zhang S.; Chen X.; Shao M.; Zhang J.; Wang K.; Lin G.; Li M.,Hepatopancreatic transcriptome profiles reveal the effects of toxic dietary concentrations of selenium on the immunity and growth of juvenile abalone Haliotis discus hannai,2023,Aquaculture Reports,28,,,,101449,"Selenium (Se) is required for the normal growth and development of aquatic animals. However, excessive Se can have various toxic effects on aquatic animals. In this study, we performed transcriptome analysis to determine the mechanism by which immunity and growth of abalone are affected by toxic dietary concentrations of Se. Four experimental diets were administered to supplement organic Se at concentrations of 0.00 (Control), 0.15 (Se15), 0.30 (Se30), and 0.60 mg/kg (Se60) to provide 0.16 (insufficient), 0.32 (optimal), 0.44 (super nutritional), and 0.60 mg/kg (toxic) Se concentrations in the diet. After feeding for 100 days, the results of the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that the enriched GO terms of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Se15 and Se30 groups were mainly focused on the cellular components, whereas the GO terms enriched in the Se60 group were mainly related to the metabolism of nutrients and the activities of various enzymes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the DEGs of the Se30 group were mainly enriched in various disease pathways, whereas the DEGs of the Se60 treatment were associated with the metabolism of various nutrients. Further analysis of DEGs showed that toxic dietary concentrations of Se decreased the immunity of abalone by affecting the biosynthesis and metabolism pathways of various nutrients. Additionally, toxic dietary concentrations of Se retarded the growth of abalone by decreasing the expression of various genes associated with shell formation, including lustrin A, perlucin, perlustrin, dermatopontin, chitin synthase, and chitinase as well as the genes associated with muscle production, including collagen, myosin heavy chain, myosin essential light chain, and paramyosin. In conclusion, the mechanism of the decrease of immunity and growth of abalone by toxic dietary concentrations of Se has been preliminary revealed in this study. © 2022",10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.101449,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144528935
Elliott N.,Genetic variation is the foundation for the future of abalone conservation and exploitation,2023,Developments in Aquaculture and Fisheries Science,42,,161,188,,"Knowledge and application of genetic variation is the foundation for the survival and exploitation of abalone, and its potential will be reached through greater communication and collaboration. Genetics encompasses a broad field of disciplines focused on the building blocks of life, the DNA molecules, which make up the genome of an organism. Whether working with individual genes or their protein products, random segments of DNA sequence or the entire genome, or the resulting phenotypes, variation is observed between individuals, populations, and species. It is utilized to assist in elucidating the phylogeny and relationships of the more than 50 extant species and subspecies of Haliotis. Genetic variation helps to determine connectivity between natural populations, which in turn helps managers determine fishery and conservation strategies to ensure sustainability and survival. Selective breeding programs—essential tools for the sustainable growth of the aquaculture sector—are founded upon and exploit the genetic variation of economically important traits. Genetic technologies are rapidly changing and to understand their potential requires ongoing communication with end users. This is particularly so as technologies become more cost-effective for application to the multiple needs of abalone, and within reach of research and commercial budgets. The recent sequencing of abalone species genomes is anticipated to have major flow-on in delivering greater knowledge and tools at a biological and molecular level not previously available. The application of genomic tools, as well as those of other disciplines such as metabolomic, proteomic, and epigenetic, has the potential to add significantly to the core areas of taxonomy, fishery management, conservation, and aquaculture. To exploit these fully for the benefit of all sectors requires improved international collaboration to maximize scientific knowledge. In addition to the new tools, opportunities need to be grasped to integrate other scientific disciplines with genetic studies, be that biogeographic and oceanographic to assist understanding natural populations, or nutritional and physiological to support aquaculture production. The culture of abalone globally will continue to expand, and to support such growth will require an increase in the application of selective breeding programs. These will take advantage of the inherent genetic variability present in abalone, as well as the opportunities presented by the ease of interspecies hybridization and the incorporation of genomic information to assist selection decisions. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/B978-0-12-814938-6.00006-3,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166287114

Results showed that 0.99%–1.95% of dietary DHA contents significantly increased the weight gain rate (WGR) in large size of abalone (P < 0.05), while the WGR in small size of abalone was significantly increased by the 0.46%–0.99% of dietary DHA contents (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the survival of abalone among all the six groups (P > 0.05). Based on the WGR, the optimal dietary DHA content for large and small size abalone were estimated to be 1.32% and 0.88%, respectively. Dietary DHA supplementation significantly increased the activities of trypsin and lipase in the intestine, the content of ∑n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and ∑n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio in digestive gland in both sizes of abalone (P < 0.05). The total glyceride concentration in the cell-free hemolymph in two sizes of abalone was decreased. In large size of abalone, 1.95%–2.25% of dietary DHA reduced the lipid content in digestive gland. Lipogenic genes in the digestive gland, including sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (srebp-1) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase, were up-regulated in the 0.46%–1.57% DHA group (P > 0.05). The mRNA expression levels of hormone sensitive lipase (hsl) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (cpt-1) of lipolytic genes in the digestive gland were significantly increased in the 0.46% and 0.99% DHA groups, respectively (P < 0.05). In the small size of abalone, the lipid content in digestive gland and soft body decreased significantly in the 1.95% and 2.25% DHA groups, respectively (P < 0.05). Lipogenic genes in the digestive gland, including srebp-1 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, were significantly down-regulated in the 0.99%–1.95% DHA group (P < 0.05). Lipolytic genes in the digestive gland, including hsl and cpt-1, were not significantly different from the control group (P > 0.05). In conclusion, based on the WGR, the dietary DHA requirements for large and small size of abalone were estimated to be 1.32% and 0.88%, respectively. Dietary DHA reduced lipid deposition in both sizes of abalone by promoting lipid decomposition and inhibiting lipid synthesis. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.739136,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85143856910

Fish meal is a key ingredient used in aquaculture feeds due to its nutritional profile and palatability. Alternative ingredients, such as insect meal and grape marc, are potential candidates to be included in aquafeeds due to their suitable nutritional profile and more sustainable production. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of insect meal and grape marc on growth and nutritional profile using abalone as an animal model in a feeding trial for 165 days. Proximate analyses were used to identify nutritional variations in abalone tissue and faecal matter, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography mass-spectrometry analyses were utilised to characterise amino acid and fatty acid composition. Results showed a 95% survival for all treatments. The inclusion of insect meal and grape marc did not affect the protein proportions of abalone tissues, but differences were found in the carbohydrate and lipid proportions. The inclusion of insect meal and grape marc significantly affected levels of amino acids L-histidine, L-methionine, and L-phenylalanine, and fatty acids oleic acid, linoleaidic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, and α-linolenic suggesting a correlation between the feed source and fatty acid tissue composition.

However, a limited occurrence of the orange-footed muscle trait makes it a valuable candidate for breeding programs. In our research, we examined the inheritance pattern of the orange-footed trait and conducted a 90-day feeding trial for H. gigantea to compare the influence of formulated feed and macroalgae on pigment enrichment and growth rates. Our results suggest that the orange-footed trait has a recessive nature relative to its common counterpart and demonstrates stable inheritance. We also identified a significant correlation between color-difference values (a*) and total carotenoid content (TCC) (R2 = 0.955, p < 0.05), suggesting the TCC in abalone foot muscle can be estimated using the a* value. Furthermore, introducing carotenoids to formulated feed imparts an orange hue to the foot muscle, but this effect is inferior compared to using Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis with a similar carotenoid content. This suggests that H. gigantea has a higher absorption efficiency for the carotenoids from the macroalgae G. lemaneiformis compared to formulated feed. Growth assessments indicate that the formulated feed, enriched with higher crude protein than G. lemaneiformis, optimally supports H. gigantea growth. Our findings furnish valuable insights that could steer breeding strategies and feeding practices towards achieving the orange-footed muscle trait in H. gigantea. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/fishes8090443,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85172184030

In this study, the seasonal variation in the nutritional components and texture properties of Haliotis discus hannai (DD) and Haliotis discus hannai ♀ × H. fulgens ♂ (DF) was determined. The moisture content of both abalone varieties (DD and DF) was found to be significantly lower in winter than in other seasons, while the opposite was true for the lipid content. In summer, DF had lower levels of protein, lipid, and taurine than DD. The levels of glycine (Gly), alanine (Ala), glutamic (Glu), and arginine (Arg) in abalone were higher in winter and spring than in summer and autumn. In terms of fatty acid levels, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the total amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were the highest in winter compared to other seasons. In addition, in terms of textural properties, the chewiness, cohesiveness, fracturability, springiness, and resilience of abalone muscles were better in winter than in summer. The seasonal variation in the nutritional quality of abalone may be closely related to the different water temperature environments of abalone, the level of resistance to high temperatures, and the timing of gonadal development. This study remedies the shortcomings of the abalone nutritional quality evaluation system and provides better guidance for consumers and farmers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738930,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85140440964

Each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate groups of 18 abalones (34.27 ± 2.93 g) that were stocked in sea cages for 8 weeks. Results showed that the maximum weight gain (WG) and specific growth rate (SGR) were obtained in hybrid male abalone fed D10 diets. The highest gonad somatic index (GSI) value was found in the D14 diet. Moreover, the ANOVA results showed that only dietary protein could significantly affect the GSI of hybrid male abalones (P < 0.05). A significant difference was observed among the groups in terms of total protein, total cholesterol, triglyceride, acid phosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of vasa in the testis of D14 abalone was the lowest. Abalones fed the D14 diet had higher testosterone levels and sperm in the testis than those fed other diets. In conclusion, protein of 300 g/kg, VE of 0.1 g/kg, and VC of 1.5 g/kg (D10) and protein of 350 g/kg, VE of 0.1 g/kg, and VC of 1 g/kg (D14) might be the optimal combinations in the diet for growth and gonadal development of hybrid male abalones respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/s10499-023-01100-z,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85152364933

Seven isonitrogenous (about 32% of crude protein) and isolipidic (about 3% of crude lipid) diets were designed with graded levels of methionine (0.46%, 0.77%, 0.97%, 1.19%, 1.41%, 1.71% and 2.07%, respectively). The experimental diets were named as M1 (control), M2, M3, M4, M5, M6 and M7, respectively. An 84-day feeding trial was conducted in sea cages (40 cm × 35 cm × 70 cm) for abalones (initial body weight: 4.10 ± 0.01 g), which were fed once every two days. The results showed that the biomass gain (BG) of abalone significantly increased (from 560.20 g to 643.83 g) with the increasing dietary methionine levels from 0.46% to 1.19%, and then decreased (from 643.83 g to 484.29 g) (P < 0.05). Based on the broken-line regression analysis of BG, the requirement of dietary methionine for abalone was determined to be 0.99% (dry matter of diet). The highest trypsin activity (862.10 U/mg prot.) and α-Amylase activity (0.28 U/mg prot.) in the intestine of abalone were observed in the M4 and M5 group, respectively. In the digestive gland, the gene expression of mtor, s6k and eif4e showed a significant quadratic trend with the increasing dietary methionine levels, and all of them reached their highest values in the M4 group. The highest mRNA level of gcn2 was observed in the M1 group. The glutathione content and total anti-oxidative capacity in cell-free hemolymph (CFH) were significantly increased as dietary methionine levels increasing from 0.46% to 1.19%, and then decreased (P < 0.05). The lowest gene expression level of keap1, nf-κb and tnf-α, and the highest gene expression level of nrf2 and iκbα in the digestive gland were found in the M4 group. After the heat stress test at the end of feeding trial, the minimum falling rate (19.44%) and the highest gene expression level of hsp70 and hsp90 in the digestive gland of abalone were found in the group with 1.19% of dietary methionine. In conclusion, appropriate dietary methionine (0.97%–1.19%) could improve the growth, protein synthesis, immunity and resistance to heat stress of abalone. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738978,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141295473

Yet, such information is lacking for Australian hybrid abalone (Haliotis rubra × Haliotis laevigata), particularly with respect to life stage and water temperatures. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of dietary protein inclusion level on the growth performance, nutrient utilisation and nutritional quality of juvenile (3·3 g) Australian hybrid abalone reared at three different temperatures representative of winter (12°C), average annual (17°C) and summer (22°C) grow-out periods and fed five diets containing graded dietary protein levels of 35, 38, 41, 44 and 47 %. Abalone growth increased with increasing water temperature with weight gains of approximately 100, 280 and 380 % of their initial weight at 12, 17 and 22°C, respectively. Furthermore, the present study clearly demonstrated that higher dietary protein inclusion levels (41 %) than those currently used commercially (35 %) would significantly improve the growth performance when water temperatures are ≥17°C without any adverse impacts on nutrient utilisation, nutrient deposition or nutritional quality of the abalone soft tissue. For example, at 22°C abalone fed a diet containing 41 % protein obtained a significantly higher weight gain percentage (421 %) compared with those fed a diet containing 35 % protein (356 %). Lastly, it is suggested that maintaining a dietary protein inclusion level of 35 % or implementing a 'least cost' feeding approach during cooler seasons, or where water temperatures are ∼12°C, may be beneficial, considering only marginal growth improvements were observed during these periods of slow growth.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Summer mortality likely involves complex interactions between biological, environmental, husbandry and nutritional factors; however, this is poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a case-control study for farmed greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) and hybrid abalone (H. laevigata × Haliotis rubra) to identify risk factors associated with summer mortality. Farm mortality data from 2015 to 2021 were used to identify tanks which fit the case definition and tanks that did not. We constructed a model to predict summer mortality risk using logistic regression and forward variable selection. Modelling considered 61 potential risk factors (examples included water quality, husbandry, climate, biology). The final selected model including six main effects and five two-way interactions. Except for maximum water temperature in the week prior to the case/control date, all parameters selected in the final model were involved in one or more interactions. The model identified interactions between age and each of previous year summer mortality, size when removed from weaning tanks and feed rate. There were also interactive effects of previous year summer mortality and size when removed from weaning tanks, and of feed rate and post-grading mortality. The risk of summer mortality was two times more likely for every 2 °C increase in maximum weekly water temperature. Post-grading mortality was associated with an increased risk of summer mortality, but relative risk decreased at higher feed rates. Risk of summer mortality in younger abalone increased with higher feed rates, while increasing feed rates for 30-month abalone had no effect on the risk of summer mortality. Abalone in tanks which experienced summer mortality the previous year were at a higher risk of summer mortality regardless of age. For abalone that did not experience summer mortality the year prior, the subsequent risk of summer mortality increased with abalone age. Improved understanding of summer mortality risk factors may help guide management strategies and future research to advance abalone aquaculture. © 2023",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739928,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166081476

Sea trials involved co-culture with European abalones (EA) or placement underneath European flat oysters (EO) or Pacific oysters (PO), using juveniles of 6–8 g initial weight. In sea-based conditions around summer (Apr–Sep), sea cucumbers grew best in EO at 0.94% d−1, followed by EA (0.88% d−1), both being in deep water (8–12 m), while sea cucumbers in the foreshore of a mega-tidal environment (PO) had the lowest growth (0.24% d−1). The indoor trial (IM) was performed with smaller individuals (≈0.3 g) and yielded a remarkable growth of 2.76% d−1 during summer (May–Sep). All experiments resulted in high survival rates, exceeding 80%. Additionally, we analysed fatty acid, amino acid, and stable isotope compositions of sea cucumbers’ body walls, along with the pigment composition of their stomach contents. These analyses provided evidence that juveniles had distinct diets in each rearing condition, all differing from the diet of adults found in the wild. Our results also demonstrate that sea cucumbers do not compete for food resources in the shellfish production, which is crucial for their integration into multi-trophic aquaculture systems. However, whether sea cucumbers may have benefitted from the organic matter from shellfish faeces and pseudofaeces and/or grew on the biofilm growing on the cage walls remains to be elucidated. © 2024 Frank David et al.",10.1155/2024/7098440,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000173358

While numerous studies have examined the direct effects of temperature on species fitness, fewer studies have analyzed how individual impacts may translate to downstream primary consumers. Temperature-induced changes in the nutritional quality of seaweed may cause critical shifts in energy and nutrient availability for these consumers. A multifaceted experiment was conducted to assess the indirect impacts of California’s coastal climate conditions on abalone growth. This experiment fed juvenile red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) of two different size classes in ambient water conditions with the seaweed dulse (Devaleraea mollis), conditioned at 13°C, 15°C, and 17°C for 92 days. Nutritional analyses revealed significantly higher protein and nitrogen content in the 17°C dulse culture than in the 15°C and 13°C cultures, and no significant differences in carbohydrates. Furthermore, analyses on body weight ratio and condition factor indicate that juvenile red abalone of smaller size display significantly better growth and condition when fed dulse cultured at higher temperatures. Differences between size classes suggest that temperature changes, and subsequent shifts in the nutritional composition of dulse, may have greater impacts on smaller, younger red abalone.

Glycogen has been proven to be a primary taste-enhancing component in most shellfish. But fewer studies were reported on Pacific abalone, and the contribution of glycogen to taste is unclear. In this study, the human sensory test, electronic tongue, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS), and multivariate statistical methods were used to investigate differences in flavor between two groups (high and low groups, respectively) of Pacific abalone with different glycogen contents. The results of the two flavor evaluations consistently showed that the scores of umami and sweetness were significantly higher in the high glycogen content group. Pacific abalone with a higher glycogen content has a better flavor. A total of 295 substantially differential metabolites were identified between the two groups. Lysine, glutamic acid, glycine, serine, threonine, nucleotides, phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were considered to be the main taste-enhancing components in the high group.

The presence of insulin and insulin-related peptides are found among animals. In Mollusca, molluscan insulin-related peptides (MIPs) are involved in their body and shell growth. Hence, this study aimed to understand if there was difference in these peptide levels of fast and slow growing Pacific abalones, Haliotis discus hannai. To this end, four abalone insulin-related peptides (AIPs) are mined from cerebral ganglia transcriptomes of fast-growing and slow-growing abalones: AIP1, −2, −3 and −6. Notably, these AIPs possess 8 cysteine residues in their predicted insulin A and B chains, potentially supporting four disulfide bridges. Further sequence analysis based on the phylogenetic tree and multiple alignment methods indicated that AIPs have sequence features that are conserved among MIPs in many gastropods. The tissue distributions of four AIPs showed ubiquitous and similar expression in the following tissues including the cerebral ganglion, hepatopancreas, gonad, and mantle of both genders. However, there is some difference in other tissue distribution. Since the food consumption is intimately associated with the hemolymph glucose and animal growth, relative AIP1, −2, −3 and − 6 expression levels in the cerebral ganglion were measured following seaweed supplementation.

Based on these results, we propose that a physiological glucose regulatory mechanism involving AIPs exists in the cerebral ganglion of the H. discus hannai neuroendocrine system. © 2023",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739992,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168087656
Cicala F.; Tripp-Valdez M.A.; Montes-Orozco V.; Cervantes-Vazquez G.S.; Lafarga-De la Cruz F.,Effects of six diets on the growth and survival rates of postlarvae of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and its hybrid (H. rufescens ♀ × H. fulgens ♂); [Efecto de seis dietas en el crecimiento y supervivencia de poslarvas de abulón rojo (Haliotis rufescens) y su híbrido (H. rufescens ♀ × H. fulgens ♂)],2023,Scientia Marina,87,1,,,e055,"One of the main bottlenecks in abalone aquaculture is maintaining individuals during the weaning stage, when the natural diet changes from diatoms (postlarvae) to macroalgae (juvenile). During this period, abalone pass through profound morphological and physiological changes, which suitable nutrient requirements must sustain. An inadequate diet can result in adverse effects such as late metamorphosis, starvation, slow growth and even death during this phase. Two strategies have been proposed to increase the growth and survival rates of weaning abalone: (i) extending feeding with benthic diatoms and (ii) abalone hybridization via interspecific crosses. To evaluate the efficiency of the two strategies, we assessed the growth and survival rates of postlarvae of pure red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and a hybrid obtained by crossing red abalone females with green abalone (H. fulgens) males. Both crosses were supplied with six different diets consisting of either one macroalgae mono-diet (Macrocystis pyrifera or Ulva ohnoi) or a mixture with Navicula incerta. Overall, cross-specific diets achieved better growth rates, suggesting that each cross may need specific food items (nutrients) during weaning. Moreover, pure red abalone generally showed the highest growth rates, while the hybrid abalone showed the highest survival rates with most tested diets. Hence, hybrids appear to be better at withstanding stressful con-ditions, and their use in aquaculture could reduce losses and increase commercial production. © 2023 CSIC.",10.3989/scimar.05300.055,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85153335415

The aetiology of these outbreaks remained unknown until the bacterium Francisella halioticida was detected in some mussel mortality cases. This retrospective study was conducted to assess the association between F. halioticida and these mussel mortalities. Mussel batches (n = 45) from the Atlantic coast and English Channel were selected from archived individual samples (n = 863) collected either during or outside of mortality events between 2014 and 2017. All mussels were analysed by real-time PCR assays targeting F. halioticida; in addition, 185 were analysed using histological analysis and 178 by 16S rRNA metabarcoding. F. halioticida DNA was detected by real-time PCR and 16S rRNA metabarcoding in 282 and 34 mussels, respectively. Among these individuals, 82% (real-time PCR analysis) and 76% (16S rRNA metabarcoding analysis) were sampled during a mortality event. Histological analyses showed that moribund individuals had lesions mainly characterized by necrosis, haemocyte infiltration and granulomas. Risk factor analysis showed that mussel batches with more than 20% of PCR-positive individuals were more likely to have been sampled during a mortality event, and positive 16S rRNA metabarcoding batches increased the strength of the association with mortality by 11.6 times. The role of F. halioti - cida in mussel mortalities was determined by reviewing the available evidence. To this end, a causation criteria grid, tailored to marine diseases and molecular pathogen detection tools, allowed more evidence to be gathered on the causal role of this bacterium in mussel mortalities. © 2024 Inter-Research.

A selective breeding program is in operation to genetically improve hybrid performance for total weight, meat yield, and appearance traits (epipodium pattern and foot colour). This study provides estimates of heterosis for these traits and genetic parameters for the two parental species and their hybrid populations, measured using 73,107 individuals collected over 14 generations. Measurements were made at 1.5 and 2.5 years for total weight, meat yield and appearance traits. Genetic variation was significant for all evaluated traits and was predominantly due to additive genetic variation. The heritability (h2) estimates of total weight at 2.5 years for H. rubra and H. laevigata was 0.54 ± 0.03 and 0.45 ± 0.02, respectively, but higher in the hybrid population (0.57 ± 0.01). For other traits the h2 estimates of hybrid populations were within the range of those for pure species. The range of h2 (with SE) at 2.5 years for meat yield, epipodium pattern and foot colour were 0.27 (0.06) to 0.78 (0.04), 0.35 (0.05) to 0.62 (0.03), and 0.18 (0.03) to 0.30 (0.02), respectively. Heterosis was present for all traits except foot colour. Effects were strongest for total weight, with a 67% gain over the mid parent value, and less for meat yield, epipodium pattern, and foot colour with gains of 6%, 9% and 6% over mid parent value, respectively. Genetic correlations between pure species performance and hybrid performance for total weight were 0.45 (0.17) for H. rubra and 0.75 (0.06) for H. laevigata and ranged from 0.27 to 0.85 for other traits. These correlations were a basis for decisions about the commercial breeding strategy. The strategy adopted is a form of reciprocal recurrent selection which uses a hybrid progeny test. Selection is based on estimation of additive hybrid effects and measurements are made on both hybrid and pure species which are treated as separate and correlated traits. © 2023",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.740275,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85175443274

Fish meal production relies on finite wild-marine resources and is considered as an unsustainable ingredient. Insect meal (IM) is considered a sustainable source with high levels of protein suitable for growth promotion. Grape marc (GM) is a waste byproduct of the winery industry rich in pigments with antioxidant capacity. However, the inclusion of both ingredients can affect the flavor of the meat of abalone and the color of the shell due to different nutritional profiles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the dietary inclusion of IM and GM on the flavor volatile compounds and shell color of the juvenile Haliotis iris in a 165-days feeding trial. Abalone were offered four experimental diets with different levels of IM and GM inclusion and a commercial diet (no IM or GM). Soft bodies of abalone were used to characterize volatile compounds using solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and color changes were analyzed in ground powder of abalone shells using color spectrophotometry 400-700 nm (visible). The results showed 18 volatile compounds significantly different among the dietary treatments. The inclusion of IM did not significantly affect the flavor volatile compounds detected, whereas the inclusion of GM reduced volatile compounds associated with lipid-peroxidation in abalone meat. The inclusion of IM and GM did not significantly affect the lightness nor the yellowness, blueness, redness, and greenness of the ground shells. The supplementation of abalone feeds with GM can help to reduce off-flavour compounds which may extend shelf-life of raw abalone meat.

Yingpu W.; Jiaqi L.; Suyan X.; Lirong C.; Longfei L.; Yitao Z.; Yuze M.,Effects of three kinds of snails on the control of oysters attached to the shell of cultured abalone; [3 种螺对养殖鲍外壳附着牡蛎的防除作用],2023,Journal of Fishery Sciences of China,30,3,344,351,,"Haliotis discus hannai Ino is a commercially important marine mollusk with a well-known high nutritional value. During cage cultivation, biofouling organisms such as oysters, sea squirts, coil worms, and barnacles often attach to the shell surface of abalone, subsequently affecting the appearance and commercial value of the abalone. Oysters that attach to the inner wall of the cage also affect the growth and survival of abalone. Because manual removal of biofouling organisms is not possible, prevention and control of oyster growth are difficult in abalone cage cultivation. Currently, two aspects of fouling organism prevention and removal are being studied: Fouling organisms attachment mechanisms and other influencing factors can be reduced on the one hand by lowering the adhesion rate; on the other hand biological control can be achieved by selecting oyster feeding species, co-cultivating with farmed shellfish, and attempting to reduce the number of fouling organisms. In this study, we compared the effects of Thais clavigera Kuster, Ceratostoma rorifluum, and Cantharus cecillei on preventing oysters from attaching to the outer shell of the abalone. Starting in the middle of July, three different types of snails were placed in the cage every 15 days for a total of six times. The cage without snails was taken as the control group. According to the results, at the end of the experiment, the number of surviving oysters on the abalone in the Cantharus cecillei group was (0.04±0.04)/ind, the number of surviving oysters in the Thais clavigera Kuster group was (2.49±0.91)/ind, the number of surviving oysters in the Ceratostoma rorifluum group was (2.21±1.05)/ind, and the number of oysters in the control group was (3.33±0.46)/ind. The three species of snails were significantly lower than the control group, with Cantharus cecillei significantly lower than the other two snail species (P<0.05). The timing of snail addition also affects the effectiveness of the snails in preventing oyster fouling. Late addition of the snails resulted in a significant number of remaining oyster shells. The control effect can be guaranteed when the shell height of the oyster is approximately 0.5 cm. In addition, the dead oyster shell height of the Cantharus cecillei group was (0.73±0.27) cm, which was significantly lower than that of the Thais clavigera Kuster group (0.88±0.28) cm, the Ceratostoma rorifluum group (0.93±0.28) cm, and the control group (0.92±0.24) cm (P<0.05). These results indicate that the size of oysters consumed by Cantharus cecillei was smaller than that of the other two snails. The three types of snails had significant control effects, and Cantharus cecillei was the most effective in preventing oyster attachment. Oyster control is affected by the time when the three types of snails feed, so it is necessary to choose the appropriate time to release the snails. When a large number of oysters have attached and grown to a certain size, Thais clavigera Kuster and Ceratostoma rorifluum can supplement Cantharus cecillei. © 2023, Journal of Fishery Sciences of China.

In this study, 3D printing technology was employed to use the abundant calcium sources and bioactive substances in Aba to enhance the osteoinductive and remineralization capacity of materials in implants for bone regeneration. The novel hybrid scaffolds were successfully 3D-printed from polycaprolactone (PCL), which has good toughness and processability, doped with powdered Aba. When the Aba particle doping was increased from 0 to 15%, the physicochemical properties of PCL were virtually unchanged, while the surfaces of scaffolds became rough, and Aba particles were gradually exposed. The Aba/PCL scaffolds had an interconnected pore structure with a pore size of approximately 200 μm and over 50% porosity, which was convenient for the transport of nutrients. With the addition of Aba, the thermodynamic stability and mechanical properties of the scaffolds significantly improved, and the maximum compressive strength and modulus reached 1.34 and 1.89 MPa, respectively, because Aba provided nucleation sites for nanohydroxyapatite (nHAP) to promote mineralization. In vitro cell experiments showed that the hybrid scaffolds had good biocompatibility and promote the proliferation of osteoblasts. In vivo results revealed that the hydroxyapatite of organic matter and trace elements in Aba particles induced the migration of stem cells and active factors to the site of a bone defect. The implantation of 3D-printed scaffolds offered a microenvironment for osteoblast attachment and proliferation, which further promotes osteogenesis-related gene expression, such as bone gamma carboxyglutamate protein (BGLAP), type I collagen (COL1A1), and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), and facilitated the repair of a skull defect. This high-value applications of Aba have the potential to improve environmental pollution and provide potentially low-cost, high-performance bone repair materials for clinical use. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/s42114-022-00593-1,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144129692
Ragg N.L.C.,"Physiology: Energetics, metabolism, and gas exchange",2023,Developments in Aquaculture and Fisheries Science,42,,119,160,,"Abalone present an unrivalled opportunity to investigate metabolic function and gas exchange in a gastropod that retains ancestral features, including paired organs and secondary shell openings. If Haliotis is regarded as a functionally homogenous genus, it is concluded that the gills are responsible for almost all gas exchange, rather than exploiting modified mantle or epipodium surfaces, as favored by many other gastropods. Gill ventilation is facilitated by external water currents, supporting a two- to three-fold increase in resting metabolic rate above levels in static water. Further increases in metabolic rate are achieved by recruiting the otherwise under-perfused left gill. As aerobic scope is exceeded, energy demand is initially supported by phosphoarginine and then anaerobic glycolysis and the tauropine and, to a lesser extent, alanopine, lysopine, and strombine pathways. Even modest muscular exertion may induce a localized anaerobic response as hemolymph circulation preferentially targets the central vasculature rather than muscles. Muscle blocks must also retain resident hemolymph to provide hydrostatic antagonism for muscle fiber extension. In the foot this is achieved using a valve structure. The valve also guards the main vasculature from damaging pressure surges and may be combined with transient cardiac arrest. Circulating hemocyanin protein tightly binds oxygen, with unloading further discouraged by a reverse Bohr shift which appears consistent with an oxygen storage function, only unloading when tissue oxygen tension is very low. Metabolic performance in resting, active, and feeding abalone is considered in the context of a changing ocean climate. As Haliotis is, in fact, far from structurally or functionally homogenous, some guidance is offered for on-going research to develop a more representative synthesis of the physiological mechanisms of this extraordinary snail. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/B978-0-12-814938-6.00005-1,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166959664

To determine the longitudinal growth characteristics of Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), shell colour rings were manipulated by feeding alternative algae, and shell length (SL) identification was performed at different ages. Eight SL records were obtained from 3147 individuals in 192 full-sib families at 6, 7, 9, 13, 18, 24, 28, and 32 months after hatching. To estimate the additive genetic and environmental variance components, longitudinal genetic analysis of repeated SL measurements was conducted using multivariate, auto-regressive, antedependence and random regression models with restricted maximum likelihood method. The results showed that the multivariate model with common full-sib family variance and residual heterogeneity of variance was the best model for the given dataset. Heritability estimates showed a decreasing trend with age, which is similar to the results obtained from the quadratic polynomial random regression model, and ranged from 0.629 at 9 months to 0.259 at 32 months. The separate rearing and tagging of single abalone at 6 months may have led to significant common environment family bias and overestimation of heritability. The antedependence model did not achieve a better fit for the obtained dataset. Estimates of genetic correlation between contiguous ages were high, ranging from 0.622 between 6 and 32 months to 0.987 between 28 and 32 months. The results demonstrated that genetic gain can be obtained in selection for Pacific abalone growth and outlined information regarding the age at which selection should be performed.

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) has a positive effect on inhibiting nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-mediated inflammation. The underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear, particularly in mollusks. Consequently, this study will investigate the process of vitamin D3/VDR regulating NF-κB pathway and further explore their functions on inflammation, autophagy, and apoptosis in abalone Haliotis discus hannai. Results showed that knockdown of VDR by using siRNA and dsRNA of VDR in vitro and in vivo led to more intense response of NF-κB signaling to lipopolysaccharide and higher level of apoptosis and autophagy. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulation after VDR silencing could partially alleviate apoptosis and induce autophagy. Overexpression of VDR restricted the K48-polyubiquitin chain-dependent inhibitor of κB (IκB) ubiquitination and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) oligomerization. Besides, VDR silencing resulted in increase of ASC speck formation. In further mechanistic studies, we showed that VDR can directly bind to IκB and IKK1 in vitro and in vivo. In the feeding trial, H&E staining, TUNEL, and electron microscope results showed that vitamin D3 deficiency (0 IU/kg) could recruit more basophilic cells and increase more TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells and lipid droplets (LDs) than vitamin D3 supplement (1000 IU/kg and 5000 IU/kg). In summary, abalone VDR plays a negative regulator role in NF-κB-mediated inflammation via interacting with IκB and inhibiting ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκB. Vitamin D3 in combination with VDR is essential to establish a delicate balance between autophagy and apoptosis in response to inflammation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",10.1007/s10565-021-09647-4,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117038788

However, information regarding the mechanisms of dietary inosine monophosphate on the growth performance of abalone are scarce. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of inosine 5’-monophosphate supplementation on the growth of abalone Haliotis squamata. Six practical diets containing seaweed meal were formulated. The control diet was a basal diet without inosine supplementation, and five experimental diets were supplemented with different levels of inosine 5’-monophosphate at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0%. Each diet was fed to triplicates group of abalone with initial average body weight and shell length 5.68 ± 0.11 g and 33.71 ± 0.57 mm, respectively. Abalone were stocked in the rectangular plastic baskets at a density of 25 abalone in each. The experimental diets were fed to abalone at a level 1-1.5% from total body weight once a day for twelve weeks feeding period. The results showed that final weight, weight gain, specific growth rate, final shell length, shell length gain and total hemocyte count were not significantly influenced by dietary inosine 5’-monophosphate. However, the total hemocyte count of abalone fed nucleotides-supplemented diets was higher than the control diet. Thus, the present study indicated that inclusion of purine nucleotides, particularly inosine 5’-monophosphate in the practical diet, did not show to improve growth of abalone. However, supplementation of inosine 5’-monophosphate has a potential to enhance health status of abalone by elevating immune response parameter. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

This can pose a serious threat to human health and well-being. In this scenario, it is imperative to explore novel antimicrobial agents to fight against multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogenic bacteria. This study employed rational design strategies, including truncation, amino acid replacement, and heterozygosity, to obtain seven α-helical, cationic, and engineered peptides based on the original template of Abhisin. Among the analogs of Abhisin, AB7 displayed broad-spectrum and potent antimicrobial activity, superior targeting of membranes and DNA, and the ability to disrupt biofilms and anti-endotoxins in vitro. Additionally, we evaluated the anti-infection ability of AB7 using a murine skin wound model infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and found that AB7 displayed negligible toxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, AB7 exhibited desirable therapeutic efficacy by reducing bacterial burden and pro-inflammatory mediators, modulating cytokines, promoting wound healing, and enhancing angiogenesis. These results highlight the potential of AB7 as a promising candidate for a new antibiotic. Key points: • A α-helical, cationic, and engineered peptide AB7 was obtained based on Abhisin. • AB7 exhibited potent antimicrobial activity and multiple bactericidal actions. • AB7 effectively treated infected skin wounds in mice.

In the current study, an in-depth investigation of the food value of Sargassum horneri as a replacement for Undaria pinnatifida on growth, body composition, body histology, gut microbiota, and the taste sensory profile of abalone Haliotis discus hannai was carried out. After a 12-week feeding trial, the results indicated that 25% replacement (SH25) induced the highest shell-growth performance and best feed utilization values, although there was no significant difference in weight-related growth parameters with the basal (no inclusion of S. horneri) and 50% replacement (SH50) diets. Interestingly, the highest protein content was detected in abalone fed the basal diet followed by SH25 and SH50. The high replacement of S. horneri in the diet showed signs of structural integrity loss in the digestive gland. The results from the pyrosequencing of the genomic DNA from the gut of the abalone indicated an insignificant difference in α-diversity parameters and only a clear boundary was observed between SH0 and SH100 diets based on principal coordinate analysis. The bacterial genera Psychrilobacter, Vibrio, and Mycoplasma predominantly occupied the gut of the abalone, although there is a difference in their relative abundance. The taste screening experiment through the use of an electronic tongue showed a comparable taste profile of the abalone and is independent of the diets given. The findings of the present study showed that S. horneri, up to 50% replacement of macroalgal ingredients, can be utilized in feed formulation for H. discus hannai. These, in turn, contribute to the expanding knowledge on the utilization of biofouling and non-traditional macroalgae for sustainable abalone aquaculture practices.

With its widespread culture, high temperature has become a key abiotic factor for the high mortality of Pacific abalone in summer, particularly in the south of China. To understand the molecular regulatory mechanisms of thermal stress response in Pacific abalone for further analyzing its heat adaptive capacity, we subjected Pacific abalone to acute heat stress at 28°C for 6, 24, and 48 hr, respectively. A total of 2,213, 2,337, and 1,420 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in Pacific abalone after 6, 24, and 48 hr of thermal stress, respectively, as compared with the control group without heat stimulation. These DEGs were significantly enriched in protein folding and chaperone-mediated protein folding process, antigen processing and presentation, and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathways. The expression of numerous molecular chaperones was significantly upregulated after thermal stress. Maintaining cellular homeostasis through the upregulated expression of molecular chaperones associated with endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways might be central to the defense of Pacific abalone against thermal stress. In addition, the expression of Toll-like receptor 6 (TLR6) and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) genes of the TLR signaling pathway was also induced. Therefore, the Pacific abalone might activate the immune defense system to resist the invasion of pathogenic bacteria by upregulating immune-related genes after thermal challenges. Our results not only contribute to a deeper understanding of heat stress regulation in the Pacific abalone but also provide basic data for molecular genetic breeding of heat-resistant abalone.  © 2023 Zhou Wu et al.",10.1155/2023/7621215,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85169911522

High temperature significantly decreased the growth, body moisture, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and hardness but increased the contents of DAA, TAA, alcohols, acids, and aromatic compounds in abalone meat. Our study suggests that high temperature significantly decreases the growth and nutritional value of abalone muscle but does provide a different mouthfeel and flavor for consumers, and nutrition-balanced artificial feed as the diet at a low water temperature maximizes the growth of abalone without sacrificing meat quality. The results may help to formulate an optimal feed strategy for farming industries throughout the abalone culture period, thereby allowing farmers to harvest premium quality abalone and elevate the market value of abalone products. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739241,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146094158
Zhang K.; Wang Y.; Zhang Z.,Research progress on response mechanism to high temperature stress in abalone; [鲍高温胁迫响应机制的研究进展],2023,Journal of Fisheries of China,47,5,,,59601,"Abalone is one of the important economic shellfish for marine aquaculture. In recent years, under the stress of high temperatures in summer, mass mortality of abalone has often occurred, which has brought huge economic losses to the aquaculture industry. This paper reviews the events of mass mortality of farmed abalone in recent years and summarizes the research progress on the response mechanism of abalone to high-temperature stress abalone from the perspectives of physio-biochemical indicators including growth, reproduction, survival, metabolism and enzyme activity as well as, cellular immunity, antioxidant system, heat shock protein, apoptosis, NF-κB signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and other related genes expression, DNA methylation, genetic diversity, etc. summarized the research progress of the response mechanism of abalone to high-temperature stress. Existing studies have shown that high temperature stress can cause abnormal physiological and biochemical in abalone to reduce metabolic levels such as feeding, destroy the stability of abalone's internal environment, reduce abalone's ability to resist pathogen invasion and respond to external environmental stimuli, thereby adversely affecting abalone's growth and immunity, which eventually lead to the death of stressed abalone. In order to provide a reference for understanding the response mechanism of abalone to high-temperature stress, facilitate the investigation of the breeding of high-temperature-resistant varieties of abalone and preventing the occurrence of mass mortality of abalone in summer.

Chu L.; Luo S.; Chen Q.; Chen X.; Xu N.; Sun X.,The Beneficial Effect of 24-Epibrassinolide Against High-Temperature Stress in Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis Revealed by Physiological Response and Transcriptomic Profiling,2024,Journal of Plant Growth Regulation,,,,,,"The commercial seaweed Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis is mainly used as raw material for agar production and feed for abalone. The heat-resistant strains G. lemaneiformis are extensively cultivated in the northern and southern coasts of China, yet high temperature in the summertime in southern coasts has hindered the growth and limited the cultivated periods of this seaweed. A vast majority of reports have manifested that exogenous phytohormone brassinosteroids (BRs) can improve the plant heat-tolerance. However, little is known about the effect and its underlying mechanism of BRs in algae. In this study, the effect of 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) on the physiological and transcriptional levels was investigated in the high-temperature stressed G. lemaneiformis. Physiological data indicated that EBR application could improve the growth with 1.43-fold on day 5 and non-photochemical quenching parameter, reduce the productions of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), enhance the accumulations of proline, trehalose, and the levels of endogenous 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenine (2MeSiP), 2-methylthio-cis-zeatin riboside (2MeScZR), jasmonic acid (JA), N-[(-)-jasmonoyl]-(l)-phenylalanine (JA-Phe) and salicylic acid 2-O-β-glucoside (SAG) under high-temperature condition. In addition, transcriptomic analysis identified 656 upregulated- and 680 downregulated-genes following the EBR treatment compared to the control group, revealed that EBR activated the metabolic pathways of the glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, and synthesis of threonine, methionine, and serine. Taken together, the aforementioned results highlighted the beneficial effect of EBR via alleviating the oxidative stress, promoting the accumulations of osmolytes and stress-related phytohormones, and activating the metabolisms of carbohydrate and amino acid, thereby resulting in the mitigating of growth inhibition by high-temperature stress in G. lemaneiformis. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",10.1007/s00344-024-11454-0,Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85201625163

Traditionally, fish meal (FM) has been the primary source of protein in aquafeed. However, there is a growing need to explore alternative sources of protein. The present study aimed first to investigate the potential of alternative animal protein sources, such as shrimp head meal (SM) and meat and bone meal (MBM), to replace FM in the diet of tropical abalone Haliotis squamata, and second to evaluate their effects on the growth of the organism. Four experimental diets were formulated, including a control diet containing FM, SM, MBM, and a mixture of fish meal, shrimp head meal, and meat and bone meal (MIX). The experimental diets were fed to triplicate groups of abalone once a day at a level of 1.5% of their total body weight. Two hundred and forty abalone with an initial average weight of 3.55±0.02 g and a shell length of 28.59±0.12 mm were distributed into 12 rectangular plastic baskets at a density of 20 abalone per basket. After twelve weeks of feeding, the final weight, weight gain, specific growth rate, final shell length, and shell length gain of abalone fed the FM diet were not significantly different (p > 0.05) from those fed the other diet treatments. Dietary treatments also did not affect the total haemocyte count (THC) of abalone. These findings suggest that SM or MBM could partially or entirely replace FM in the abalone feed. © 2023, BIOFLUX SRL. All rights reserved.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85174464195

After the feeding trial, the findings found that the highest weight gain rate (WGR) belonged to the groups fed with 0.63% ∼ 1.72% of dietary EPA (P < 0.05). The lowest feed conversion ratio was distinguished in the groups with 0.63% ∼ 1.07% of dietary EPA (P < 0.05). Also, EPA supplementation in abalone feed increased the content of crude lipid in the soft body and the activity of lipase in the intestine (P < 0.05). The total antioxidative capacity increased when dietary EPA levels rose from 0.03% to 1.07%, and then decreased (P < 0.05). Furthermore, compared to the control group, the 0.24% and 0.24% ∼ 0.63% of dietary EPA significantly down-regulated the mRNA levels of IκB kinase and kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, respectively (P < 0.05). However, nuclear factor-κB and interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 4 genes expression in the digestive gland were significantly up-regulated by the use of 1.72% and 2.25% of EPA in diet (P < 0.05). The mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 16 were significantly up-regulated by the 2.25% of dietary EPA (P < 0.05). The 1.72% of dietary EPA significantly increased the falling rate of abalone after the heat stress compared with the control (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the optimal dietary EPA requirement of juvenile abalone was determined as 1.36% based on quadratic regression analysis against WGR. Moderate dietary EPA content (0.63% ∼ 1.07%) improved the immunity and heat resistance of abalone. Excessive dietary EPA content (1.72% ∼ 2.25%) decreased the growth, meanwhile, increasing the oxidative stress, inflammation and susceptibility of abalone to heat stress. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.740015,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85169068611

In marine molluscs, while the physiological effects of OA are well known, with a reduction of growth and shell calcification, there are few studies on behavioural effects. A large marine gastropod, Haliotis tuberculata, was exposed to ambient (pHT 8.0) or low pH (pHT 7.7) during a 5-month experiment. Because animal fitness can be affected through various behavioural changes, a broad spectrum of behavioural parameters was investigated, including situations involving no stress, responses to predators, righting to evaluate indirectly the level of energy reserves, and finally, reproductive behaviour. In addition, we measured the expression profile of the GABA A-like and serotonin receptor genes, often described as central neuromodulators of sensory performance and behaviour and known to be affected by OA in molluscs. No significant effect of low pH as compared to ambient pH was observed on abalone behaviour for any of these behavioural traits or gene expressions after either one week or several months of exposure to OA. The significance tests were corroborated by estimating the size of pH effects. The behaviour of this mollusc appears not to be affected by pH decrease expected by the end of the century, suggesting some resilience of the species to OA at the adult stage. This is probably related to the ecological niche of this abalone, where important pH variations can be observed at tidal, diurnal or seasonal scales. © 2023",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167526,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85175238569

A better understanding of the pollution sources of the coastal areas is essential for developing comprehensive ecological environment management approaches for Sansha Bay. Based on land use data, socialeconomic statistics and pollution source investigation data, the pollutant discharge coefficient method was used to evaluate the total nitrogen and total phosphorus fluxes into Sansha Bay, the largest bay in Fujian Province. A comprehensive and systematic analysis was conducted to investigate the composition and distribution of the pollutants. The results show that the net total nitrogen and total phosphorus fluxes produced by land-based sources (including industrial production, residents' living, cultivation, livestock and poultry breeding, and land-based fish farming) and sea-based pollution sources (including tidal flat aquaculture, raft culture, and cage culture) in 2020 were 238 and 622 tons, respectively. The primary source of the total nitrogen and total phosphorus was land-based pollution, with fluxes of 2 564 and 352 tons, respectively. The fluxes of total nitrogen and total phosphorus from the primary sea-based pollution sources were -2 326 and 270 tons, respectively. Cultivation was the dominant land-based source of pollution, accounting for 46.4% and 41.4% of the total nitrogen and total phosphorus fluxes, respectively. Notable heterogeneity was observed in the total nitrogen and total phosphorus fluxes across the watersheds. The Jiaoxi Watershed, with the largest watershed area, was responsible for the greatest proportion of land-based pollutant fluxes. Feed-based aquaculture (such as fish, abalone, and sea cucumber feeding) was the main sea-based pollution source, whereas the non-feeding shellfish and macroalgae can assist in the assimilation of the nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients. © 2024, China Environmental Science Press.

Stone D.A.J.; Bansemer M.S.; Currie K.-L.,Abalone nutrition,2023,Developments in Aquaculture and Fisheries Science,42,,9,44,,"Wild abalone graze on a range of micro and macroalgal species. Macroalgae are also used to feed farmed abalone in a number of countries, including China, Korea, South Africa, and Chile. Abalone cultured in intensive systems are predominantly reliant on formulated feeds. These diets are formulated using current knowledge of the nutritional requirements of a range of cultured abalone and fish species, and use a range of terrestrial ingredients (cereal, oilseed, and pulse meals) and low levels of marine ingredients (sustainable levels of fish meal and fish oil). Any number of ingredient and inclusion level combinations can be used to arrive at the nutrient specifications. Abalone, like fish and other animals, have a requirement for protein (essential amino acids), lipids (omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids), and a range of vitamins and minerals. Although research into abalone dietary development has been extensive, knowledge gaps remain regarding nutrient requirements and their role in growth, health, and product quality. Unlike for some commonly cultured freshwater and marine fish, such as rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), knowledge of the key nutrient requirements for essential amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals for commonly cultured species of abalone are incomplete or nonexistent. This places some constraints on formulating commercial production diets for optimum growth and health. To improve abalone production further, it is recommended that research be conducted to establish more detailed nutrient requirement information for abalone on a species-by-species basis. Research needs to occur in relation to age, water temperature, and the use of traditional and new ingredients for formulated feeds to optimize commercial abalone production. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/B978-0-12-814938-6.00002-6,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166920412

However, due to a paucity of genetic information, such as transcriptome resources, our understanding of their stress adaptation is restricted. In this research, using single-molecule long-read (SMRT) sequencing technology, a library composed of ten tissues (i.e., haemocytes, gills, muscle, hepatopancreas, digestive tract, mantle, mucous gland, ovary, testis and head) was constructed and sequenced. In all, 41,855 high-quality unique transcripts, among which 24,778 were successfully annotated. Additionally, 13,463 SSRs, 1,169 transcription factors, and 18,124 lncRNAs were identified in H. discus hannai transcriptome. Furthermore, multiple immune-related transcripts were identified according to KEGG annotation, and a portion of these transcripts were mapped into several classical immune-related pathways, including the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Additionally, 24 typical sequences related to the immunity pathway were detected by RT-PCR; the results showed that most of the immune-related genes showed significantly high expression at 72 h after bacterial challenges and thermal stress, especially the expression level of genes in gills was significantly higher than that in haemocytes under V. parahaemolyticus stress at 24 h. At the same time. The analysis of alternative splicing identified several innate immunity-related functions genes, including CD109 and caspase 2. These results suggest that the complex immune system, particularly the powerful innate immunity system, was crucial for H. discus hannai response to numerous environmental challenges. © 2022",10.1016/j.fsi.2022.01.042,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124303251

The starfish outbreak in coastal areas will lead to severe economic losses in aquaculture and damage the ecological environment. However, the current monitoring methods are still artificial, time-consuming, and laborious. This study used an underwater observation platform with multiple sensors to observe the starfish outbreak in Weihai, Shandong Province. The platform could collect the temperature, salinity, depth, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, other water quality data, and underwater video data. Based on these data, the paper proposed an early warning model for starfish prevalence (EWSP) based on multi-sensor fusion. A deep learning-based object detection method extracts time-series information on the number of starfish from underwater video data. For the extracted starfish quantity information, the model uses the k-means clustering algorithm to divide the starfish prevalence level into four levels: no prevalence, mild prevalence, medium prevalence, and high prevalence. Correlation analysis concluded that the water quality factors most closely related to the starfish prevalence level are temperature and salinity. Therefore, the selected water quality factor and the number of historical starfish are inputted. The future starfish prevalence level of the starfish outbreak is used as an output to train the BP (back propagation) neural network to build EWSP based on multi-sensor fusion. Experiments show that the accuracy rate of this model is 97.26%, whose precision meets the needs of early warning for starfish outbreaks and has specific application feasibility.

However, traditional methods of probiotic administration in aquaculture are inefficient due to environmental contamination and loss of bacterial viability. This study investigates a new delivery system for delivery of probiotics to H. iris. An extrusion technique coupled with ionotropic gelation was utilized to produce chitosan coated alginate beads (CCALG). Concentration of alginate, chitosan, and coating time were optimized to obtain beads with a desired morphology, stability, sinking time, and release profile. The results showed that increasing alginate concentration up to 1.5% w/w can improve the morphological characteristics of the beads while reducing the sinking time in seawater. Chitosan coating improved the stability of beads and reduced the release of the encapsulated probiotics in seawater. A higher probiotic load was found in the digestive tract of animals fed with CCALG beads ((Formula presented.) compared to the control group ((Formula presented.). High palatability and stability of CCALG beads in seawater combined with controlled release of viable probiotics show that encapsulation of probiotics in CCALG beads is an efficient method for delivery of probiotics in aquaculture. © 2022 The Authors.

Results suggested that storage caused protein oxidation in RTE abalone muscles during storage, reflected by increases in carbonyl group and disulfide bond contents, as well as decreases in free sulfhydryl group and amino acid contents, which also contributed to nutrient loss. Meanwhile, oxidation led to the degradation of proteins, especially collagen connective proteins, which caused decline in water hold capacity of RTE abalone muscles, ultimately resulting in decreases in shear force and hardness. In addition, adding antioxidants and eliminating pro-oxidants (copper ions) through bloodletting effectively retarded protein oxidation and degradation during storage, which significantly prevented texture deterioration and nutrient loss. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.jfca.2022.104456,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124420039

The aim of the present study was to determine the antioxidant activity and oxidative stress-oriented apoptosis pathway in saccharides supplemented cryopreserved sperm of Pacific abalone. Cryopreserved sperm showed impaired antioxidant defenses due to the reduced mRNA abundance of antioxidant genes (CAT, Cu/Zn‐SOD, Mn‐SOD, GPx, GR, and BCL‐2), apoptosis inhibitor (HSP70, and HSP90) gene, and enzymatic antioxidant activity compared to fresh sperm. Such impaired antioxidant defenses caused an increase in the mRNA expression of apoptosis genes (Bax, and Caspase‐3), finally leading to apoptosis. The impaired antioxidant defense also increased O2•− production and lipid peroxidation (MDA) levels, which further accelerated apoptosis. Considering all the experimental findings, an apoptosis pathway of cryopreserved sperm has been adopted for the first time. Specifically, sperm cryopreserved using 3% sucrose combined with 8% dimethyl sul-foxide (DMSO) showed improved mRNA stability, enzymatic activity, and DNA integrity with reduced O2•− production and MDA levels compared to sperm cryopreserved with the other types of examined cryoprotectants (8% ethylene glycol + 1% glucose, 6% propylene glycol + 2% glucose, 2% glycerol + 3% glucose, and 2% methanol + 4% trehalose). The present study suggests that 3% sucrose combined with 8% DMSO is suitable to cryopreserve the sperm of this valuable species for molecular conservation. © 2022 by the authors.

Less is known about MDPV pharmacokinetics, especially with respect to brain concentrations of the drug and its metabolites. Objectives: The goal of the present study was: 1) to determine brain concentrations of MDPV and its metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxypyrovalerone (3,4-catechol-PV) and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-pyrovalerone (4-OH-3-MeO-PV), after administration of MDPV, and 2) to relate brain pharmacokinetic measures to pharmacodynamic end-points in the same subjects. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-400 g) received s.c. MDPV injection (1, 2, or 4 mg/kg) or its saline vehicle. Groups of rats were decapitated at 40 min and 240 min postinjection. Locomotor behavior was rated before decapitation, and the core temperature was obtained. Plasma and frontal cortex were analyzed to quantitate MDPV and its metabolites. Striatal samples were analyzed to measure dopamine, serotonin (5-HT), and their metabolites. Results: MDPV displayed brain-to-plasma ratios greater than 1 (range 8.8-12.1), whereas 3,4-catechol-PV and 4-OH-3-MeO-PV showed ratios less than 1 (range 0-0.3). MDPV increased behavioural scores reflective of locomotor stimulation at 40 and 240 min and produced slight hyperthermia at 240 min. MDPV had no effect on striatal dopamine but produced an increase in the metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA). Brain MDPV concentrations were positively correlated with behavioural scores and striatal HVA but not with other endpoints. Conclusion: The behavioural effects of MDPV are related to brain concentrations of the parent drug and not its metabolites. The modest effects of MDPV on monoamine systems suggest that other non-monoamine mechanisms may contribute to the effects of the drug in vivo. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.",10.2174/1381612828666220907100036,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85140344941
Dai Q.; Cho S.H.,"Dietary effect of substituting Saccharina japonica with cabbage extract by‐product on the growth, body composition and air exposure of juvenile abalone (Haliotis discus hannai Ino 1952)",2022,Aquaculture Reports,22,,,,100977,"Dietary substitution effect of cabbage extract by‐product (CEB) for Saccharina japonica on the growth, body composition and air exposure stressor of juvenile abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) was determined. A total of 1260 abalone were randomly distributed into 18 net cages (seventy per cage). Five formulated diets were prepared. The control (CEB0) diet contained 20% S. japonica powder. Twenty-five, 50%, 75%, and 100% of S. japonica were substituted with the equal amount of CEB, referred to as the CEB25, CEB50, CEB75 and CEB100 diets, respectively. Ultimately, dry S. japonica was prepared to compare formulated diets on growth of abalone. Each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate groups of abalone and fed to abalone every other day for 16 weeks. After the 16-week feeding trial, abalone were subjected to air exposure for 24 h, and then survival was monitored for the next 6 days. All formulated diets achieved greater weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) than those of abalone fed the S. japonica. Weight gain and SGR of abalone linearly improved with dietary increased substitution levels of S. japonica with CEB. Shell growth of abalone tended to agree with growth rate. The chemical composition of the soft body of abalone was not affected by the experimental diets. Survival of abalone fed all formulated diets was (P < 0.05) higher than that of abalone fed S. japonica at the end of the 6-day post observation period after the 24-h air exposure. In conclusion, S. japonica could be completely (100%) substituted with CEB in abalone feeds when 20% S. japonica was included. Substitution of S. japonica with CEB in feeds could improve growth of abalone, but lower feed cost. © 2021",10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.100977,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121255363

Although SODs have been extensively studied in mammals and other species, comparative studies in invertebrates, such as abalones, are lacking. Here, we aimed to characterize manganese superoxide dismutase in disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) (AbMnSOD) by assessing its transcriptional levels at different embryonic developmental stages. Additionally, the temporal expression of AbMnSOD in different abalone tissues in response to bacterial, viral, and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) stimuli was investigated. SOD activity was measured at various recombinant protein concentrations via the xanthine oxidase/WST-1 system. Cell viability upon exposure to H2O2, wound healing ability, and subcellular localization were determined in AbMnSOD-transfected cells. AbMnSOD was 681 bp long and contained the SOD-A domain. AbMnSOD expression was higher at the trochophore stage than at the other stages. When challenged with immune stimulants, AbMnSOD showed the highest expression at 6 h post-injection (p.i.) for all stimulants except lipopolysaccharides. In the gills, the highest AbMnSOD expression was observed at 6 h p.i., except for the Vibrio parahaemolyticus challenge. Recombinant AbMnSOD showed concentration-dependent xanthine oxidase activity. Furthermore, AbMnSOD-transfected cells survived H2O2-induced apoptosis and exhibited significant wound gap closure. As expected, AbMnSOD was localized in the mitochondria of the cells. Our findings suggest that AbMnSOD is an essential antioxidant enzyme that participates in regulating developmental processes and defense mechanisms against oxidative stress in hosts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.dci.2021.104299,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118249968

We used pure blacklip (Haliotis rubra) and greenlip (Haliotis laevigata) abalone, as well as their hybrid, to test whether differences in movement and/or aerobic versus anaerobic energy use are linked to a purported increased growth rate in hybrids. Abalone were acclimated to control (16 °C) and typical summer temperatures (23 °C), each with oxygen treatments of 100% air saturation (O2sat) or 70% O2sat. The experiment then consisted of two phases. During the first phase (chronic exposure), movement and oxygen consumption rates (ṀO2) of abalone were measured during a 2 day observation period at stable acclimation conditions. Additionaly, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and tauropine dehydrogenase (TDH) activities were measured. During phase two (acute exposure), O2sat was raised to 100% for abalone acclimated to 70% O2sat followed by an acute decrease in oxygen to anoxia for all acclimation groups during which movement and ṀO2 were determined again. During the chronic exposure, hybrids and H. laevigata moved shorter distances than H. rubra. Resting ṀO2, LDH and TDH activities, however, were similar between abalone types but were increased at 23 °C compared to 16 °C. During the acute exposure, the initial increase to 100% O2sat for individuals acclimated to 70% O2sat resulted in increased movement compared to individuals acclimated to 100% O2sat for hybrids and H. rubra when compared within type of abalone. Similarly, ṀO2 during spontaneous activity of all three types of abalone previously subjected to 70% O2sat increased above those at 100% O2sat. When oxygen levels had dropped below the critical oxygen level (Pcrit), movement in hybrids and H. laevigata increased up to 6.5-fold compared to movement above Pcrit. Differences in movement and energy use between hybrids and pure species were not marked enough to support the hypothesis that the purportedly higher growth in hybrids is due to an energetic advantage over pure species. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s00360-021-01388-4,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110825278

Recent studies have detailed the sequencing of DNA extracted from shells up to thousands of years old and from various taphonomic and preservational contexts. However, previous approaches have largely addressed methodological rather than evolutionary research questions. Here, we report the generation of DNA sequence data from mollusc shells using such techniques, applied to Haliotis virginea Gmelin, 1791, a New Zealand abalone, in which morphological variation has led to the recognition of several forms and subspecies. We successfully recovered near-complete mitogenomes from 22 specimens including 12 dry-preserved shells up to 60 years old. We used a combination of palaeogenetic techniques that have not previously been applied to shell, including DNA extraction optimized for ultra-short fragments and hybridization-capture of single-stranded DNA libraries. Phylogenetic analyses revealed three major, well-supported clades comprising samples from: (1) The Three Kings Islands; (2) the Auckland, Chatham and Antipodes Islands; and (3) mainland New Zealand and Campbell Island. This phylogeographic structure does not correspond to the currently recognized forms. Critically, our nonreliance on freshly collected or ethanol-preserved samples enabled inclusion of topotypes of all recognized subspecies as well as additional difficult-to-sample populations. Broader application of these comparatively cost-effective and reliable methods to modern, historical, archaeological and palaeontological shell samples has the potential to revolutionize invertebrate genetic research. © 2022 The Authors.

Boiling heat treatments caused protein oxidation in the abalone muscles, reflected by increases in the carbonyl group and disulfide bond contents, protein hydrophobicity and aggregation degree, as well as decreases in the free sulfhydryl group and amino acid contents. Protein oxidation significantly inhibited the degree of hydrolysis, digestion rate, and digestibility of the abalone muscles in the simulated digestion model. The results from the everted-rat-gut-sac model showed that amino acid and peptide transport levels from the digestion products of the cooked abalone muscles were lower than those of the uncooked samples. In contrast, the addition of antioxidants of bamboo leaves mitigated heat-treatment-induced protein oxidation, aggregation and increased hydrophobicity, and consequently improved abalone muscle protein digestibility and transport levels.

The study compared noodles and flakes prepared using refined and unrefined diets developed earlier for H. asinina (Bautista-Teruel et al., J. Shellfish Res., 35, 2016, 633). Four treatment diets in triplicates (refined flakes, MBTr-F; refined noodles, MBTr-N; unrefined flakes, MBTur-F; and unrefined noodles, MBTur-N) were used in a feeding experiment conducted in a tank facility. After three months, abalone fed MBTr-F had significantly higher mean shell length and body weight (35.92 ± 0.36 mm, 9.24 ± 0.29 g) compared with those fed MBTr-N (34.63 ± 0.37 mm, 8.22 ± 0.28 g) and MBTur-N (34.23 ± 0.36 mm, 7.66 ± 0.26 g), but did not significantly differ with those fed MBTur-F (35.40 ± 0.30 mm, 8.57 ± 0.24 g).

To deal with this issue antibiotics are a widely-preferred control strategy, but one that poses risks to the environment and humans, if used indiscriminately. In pursuit of an alternative, probiotics have emerged recently among viable alternatives for health management in aquaculture. The prophylactic use of probiotics in farmed shellfish species, i.e., shrimp, prawn, crab, crayfish, oyster and abalone, has been demonstrated to enhance production, promote the host internal microbiota, resulting in reduced incidence of bacterial, parasitic and even viral (e.g., White Spot Syndrome Virus/WSSV, Yellowhead disease/YHD) diseases. Probiotics can be administered either as feed supplements or directly into rearing water, the former being generally more effective. Although precise modes of action are unknown, probiotics can deliver some measure of sustainability to shellfish aquaculture in multiple ways, including contributions to pathogen exclusion, better growth, survival and feed utilization, and immune modulation. Antiviral mechanisms of probiotics are not well documented, but certain protobionts such as Bacillus and Lactobacillus have been effective in developing disease resistance and in reducing the prevalence of WSSV and YHD in a number of studies. This review discusses recent advances on the role of probiotics in shellfish aquaculture, emphasizing their prophylactic activity against viral diseases. © 2022 The Authors",10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.101220,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133615574

Environmental hypoxia events can have significant effects on marine organisms, but for breeding programs and other practical applications, it is important to further explore the long-term physiological effects of early hypoxia exposure in economically significant species. In this study, the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai was exposed to moderate hypoxia (∼4 mg/L) from zygote to trochophora, and the assessments of hypoxia tolerance were conducted on the grow-out stage. The results revealed that juvenile abalones exposed to hypoxia at the early development stages were more hypoxia-tolerant but with slower weight growth, a phenomenon called the trade-off between growth and survival. These phenotypic effects driven by the hypoxia exposure were explained by strong selection of genes involved in signal transduction, autophagy, apoptosis, and hormone regulation. Moreover, long non-coding RNA regulation plays an important role modulating carry-over effects by controlling DNA replication and repair, signal transduction, myocardial activity, and hormone regulation. This study revealed that the ability to create favorable phenotypic differentiation through genetic selection and/or epigenetic regulation is important for the survival and development of aquatic animals in the face of rapidly changing environmental conditions.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.",10.1021/acs.est.2c04975,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85143853445

Owing to the strong interfacial hydrogen bond between linear PVA and two-dimensional BP-OH-GO, the PVA/BP-OH-GO 25 composite film exhibited outstanding mechanical properties, with tensile fracture strain up to 86.6% and tensile strength up to 74.3 MPa (1.63 and 2.14 times that of pure PVA, respectively). In addition, the toughness of the PVA/BP-OH-GO 25 film reached 2-3 times that of pure PVA, achieving the purpose of increasing strength and toughness simultaneously. In addition, the composite film also achieved admirable fire resistance, thermal stability, smoke suppression, and toxicity reduction performance. Therefore, a type of bionic PVA/BP/GO film was designed and prepared, which provided a direction for designing synthetic biomimetic composite materials with high fire safety and mechanical properties. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Six experimental diets in a 3 × 2 two-factor design were formulated with graded levels of dietary EPA (0.25%, 0.75% and 1.25%) and dietary VC (0 and 1260 mg/kg). Results showed that the weight gain rate (WGR) of abalone was significantly increased with the increasing dietary EPA levels (P < 0.05), but there was no significant effect of dietary VC on the WGR. The significant highest superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was observed in the group with 1.25% of dietary EPA and 1260 mg/kg of dietary VC, and there was a significant interaction between dietary EPA and VC (P < 0.05). Dietary EPA supplementation significantly improved muscle hardness and the content of ∑n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, volatile compounds, adenosine-5′-monophosphate (AMP) and inosine-5′-monophosphate (IMP) in muscle. Dietary VC supplementation significantly improved the muscle hardness, springiness, chewiness, and the contents of volatile compounds, hydroxyproline and IMP in muscle (P < 0.05). Significant interactions between dietary EPA and VC were observed on volatile compounds, AMP and IMP (P < 0.05).

Seven isonitrogenous and isolipidic experimental diets were formulated with graded levels of Cr (0.04, 0.67, 1.21, 1.58, 2.21, 2.72 and 3.33 mg/kg) from Cr yeast. The results showed that weight gain rate (WGR) was highest in the group with 1.21 mg/kg of dietary Cr. Based on the broken-line regression analysis for WGR, the dietary Cr requirement of abalone was estimated to be 1.32 mg/kg. With the increase of dietary Cr level from 0.04 to 1.21 mg/kg, the total anti-oxidative capacity and lysozyme activity in the cell-free hemolymph were increased and then decreased when the dietary Cr level exceeded 1.21 mg/kg. After the challenge of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, the cumulative mortality of abalone was significantly decreased in the group with 1.21 mg/kg of dietary Cr compared with that in the control group. Meanwhile, after the heat stress test, the cumulative mortality of abalone was significantly reduced in the groups with 1.58, 2.21 and 2.72 mg/kg of dietary Cr compared with that in the control group. The liquid and water loss of foot muscle were significantly increased in the groups with 2.72 and 3.33 mg/kg of dietary Cr. With the increase of dietary Cr levels, the hardness of foot muscle was significantly elevated. The chewiness of foot muscle was significantly increased with the increase of dietary Cr level from 0.04 to 1.21 mg/kg, and thereafter showed no significant difference when dietary Cr exceeded 1.21 mg/kg. In conclusion, based on the WGR, dietary Cr requirement of abalone (initial weight: 22.31 ± 0.31 g) was estimated to be 1.32 mg/kg. Appropriate dietary Cr levels (1.21–1.58 mg/kg) had positive effects on growth performance, immune response, anti-oxidation, anti-stress and flesh quality of abalone. Overhigh dietary Cr level (2.72–3.33 mg/kg) decreased the flesh quality.

Grazing periodicity, grazing rate, and feeding preference were measured; at the same time, abalone gut content was examined. Grazing incidence appeared to be continuous with significantly higher grazing intensity observed at nighttime from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. (79%) than at daytime from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. (40%) (p < 0.05). Grazing rates from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. were significantly higher on N. ramosissima (1.6 × 105) among diatom species but was not statistically different from Cocconeis sp. (1.1 × 105) (p > 0.05). Broken cells of Amphora sp. (22%) were significantly higher in the gut of H. asinina compared to Cocconeis sp. (2.8%), N. ramosissima, (1.8%), and Tryblionella sp. (0.2%) although the abundance of Nitzschia sp. (6%) was not significantly different from Amphora sp. (p > 0.05). Early juveniles showed significant preference for Cocconeis sp.

Survival of H. asinina was similar in 4 diatom species (46–71%) except in Tryblionella sp. (8–12%). These findings suggest that diatom species Cocconeis sp., Nitzschia sp., Amphora sp., and N. ramosissima are the suitable live food for H. asinina early juveniles.

Rogers-Bennett L.; Catton C.A.,Cascading impacts of a climate-driven ecosystem transition intensifies population vulnerabilities and fishery collapse,2022,Frontiers in Climate,4,,,,908708,"The recent large-scale intensification of marine heatwaves, and other climate-related stressors, has dramatically impacted biogenic habitats around the globe, including marine ecosystems such as coral reefs, seagrasses, and kelp forests. While the impacts to foundation species may be of particular concern, these ecological catastrophes underscore the need to examine how whole systems respond to a suite of stressors. The recent climate-driven collapse of the bull kelp forest and recreational red abalone fishery in northern California provides an example of unanticipated ripple and lagged effects in the system, intensifying vulnerabilities and accelerating population and fishery collapse. For this case study, we examined 15 years (2003–2018) of biological survey data on the bull kelp forest ecosystem—before, during, and after an extreme climate event. We document the interactions and complexity of impacts over time, as well as the resulting increased vulnerability of red abalone to additional anthropogenic, biological, and environmental stressors. We observed progressively stronger population-level responses of the red abalone to the marine heatwave and the regional loss of kelp, driving the movement of adults and juveniles in search of food. As food remained scarce, we documented the loss of productivity with diminished gonad and body condition, the absence of larval or newly-settled abalone, mass mortalities, and shoreward shifts in depth distributions. With 40% of the population dead or dying, juvenile and trophy-sized abalone abandoning cryptic habitats, the shift in the distribution to shallower depths increased the vulnerability of red abalone to the fishery. Other anthropogenic, biological, and climate-related stressors that disproportionately impact shallow habitats are now a growing concern for the survivors. For red abalone, previously unanticipated cascading risks include increased wave energy, warming air temperatures, freshwater flooding, landslides, as well as possible oil spills and harmful algal blooms. Climate-driven changes in vulnerability to fishing and environmental stressors present significant challenges for sustainable natural resource management in dynamic stressed systems, and underscore the need for continued system-focused monitoring. We present a conceptual framework supporting similar ecosystem investigations of recent and future climate impacts to inform adaptive ecosystem-based management strategies.

Coinciding with the recent population growth, the sea otter distribution, which previously tended to concentrate on the island’s west end during 2003–2006 before shifting toward more use in the north and south sides during 2017–2019, appears to have shifted again during 2020–2023 to concentrate at the island’s east end. Forage data were collected between February 2020 and April 2023. There was a total of 773 forage dives in 60 forage bouts, with most of the identified prey on successful dives (n=401) recorded as sea urchins (66 percent), followed by bivalves (15 percent), snails (12 percent), and crabs (5.2 percent). Two lobsters and three abalone also were identified among the sea otter prey. Estimates of energy intake rates averaged 14.0 kilocalories per minute (95-percent confidence interval =10.8–17.2 kilocalories per minute). Monitoring data from the past two decades indicate that sea otters at San Nicolas Island have maintained a steady pattern of energy intake and population growth characteristic of a robust population, including a sixfold growth between 2000 and 2023. There was no conclusive evidence of density-dependent effects based on these patterns; however, estimates of energy intake rates for 2020–2023 were slightly lower than previous estimates from 2017 to 2019. Additionally, subtidal monitoring results at four sites around San Nicolas Island indicated that counts of purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) have increased between 2003 and 2023, whereas sea otter foraging surveys completed during the same period revealed that some sea otters have shifted toward higher consumption of purple sea urchins and bivalves compared to red sea urchins (S. fransicanus), which generally are the preferred larger prey of sea otters. These results contribute to the understanding of population dynamics and to the conservation and planning of future monitoring and research of sea otters at San Nicolas Island. © 2023, US Geological Survey.

Tissue organogenesis, shell formation, and shell length significantly declined due to low pH. High temperature significantly increased the proportion of fully shelled larvae at 24 h post-fertilization (hpf), but increased the proportion of unshelled larvae at 72 hpf. Percentage of swimming larvae at 24 hpf, 72 hpf and 96 hpf significantly declined due to high temperature, but not because of low pH. Larval settlement increased under high temperature, but was not affected by low pH. Despite the fact that no interaction between temperature and pH was observed, the results provide additional evidence on the sensitivity of abalone larvae to both low pH and high temperature. This may have negative consequences for the persistence of abalone populations in natural and aquaculture environments in the near future. © 2021",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.113131,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120035492

Nowadays, molluscan shellfish belonging to the classes Bivalvia and Gastropoda are of commercial interest for fisheries and aquaculture. Although bioactive properties of bivalve molluscs have been widely investigated and several dietary supplements have been brought to the market, the bioactive potentialities of marine gastropods are poorly documented. The present study investigated the bioactive properties of tissue extracts derived from Haliotis tuberculata coccinea, or “European abalone,” an edible abalone species distributed in the Mediterranean Sea and the northeast Atlantic Ocean. A bioactive organic compound-rich extract was obtained using ethyl acetate as extracting solvent. It showed antimicrobial activity towards the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strain RP62A, the emerging multi-drug-resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia D71 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538P, being the most sensitive strain. It also showed anthelmintic activity, evaluated through the toxicity against the target model helminth Caenorhabditis elegans. In addition, the ethyl acetate extract demonstrated a selective cytotoxic activity on the cancer cell lines A375, MBA-MD 231, HeLa, and MCF7, at the concentration of 250 µg/mL. The fatty acid composition of the bioactive extract was also investigated through FAME analysis. The fatty acid profile showed 45% of saturated fatty acids (SAFA), 22% of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and 33% of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The presence of some biologically important secondary metabolites in the extract was also analysed, revealing the presence of alkaloids, terpenes, and flavonoids. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10126-021-10073-0,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118363939

It is widely distributed in marine ecosystems worldwide, and it poses a threat to the survival of aquatic animals. The tissues of the abalone Haliotis discus hannai are easily damaged by homo-YTX during harmful algal blooms. In this study, H. discus hannai was exposed to homo-YTX (0, 2, 5, and 10 µg L−1) to evaluate the rates of survival (S) and death (D) and the antioxidative, metabolic, and digestive physiological responses in the gills and digestive gland of abalone. Homo-YTX decreased S and the activities of Na+/K+–adenosine triphosphatase, Ca2+/Mg2+–adenosine triphosphatase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, alkaline phosphatase, xanthine oxidase, lactate dehydrogenase, amylase, protease, and lipase. Meanwhile, D, the reactive oxygen species level, and the malondialdehyde content increased with increasing concentrations of homo-YTX. In addition, homo-YTX induced oxidative stress, enhanced the lipid peroxidation reaction, reduced the energy supply, and inhibited the metabolic and digestive physiological activities in the gills and digestive gland of abalone. Oxidative stress-mediated insufficient energy supply and physiological activity reduction caused the death of abalone. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.tox.2022.153270,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134601913

Additionally, virulence genes were also linked to adherence and invasion. Methods and Results: All S. uberis were able to adhere and invade the cells at different levels. UB56 strain showed the highest percentage of internalization (3.65%) and presented a moderate level of adhesion (4.6 × 106). In contrast, UB152, the most adherent strain (8.7 × 106) showed a low capacity to internalize (0.65%). Eight strains were able to persist intracellularly over 96 h regardless of their adherence or invasion level. Statistical analysis between biofilm-forming ability and the adhesion capacity showed no significant differences. Presence of virulence genes involved in the adhesion process (gapC, hasABC, lbp, pauA and sua) showed that the strains harboured different genes and seven patterns could be observed. Conclusion: Statistical analysis showed no correlation between the virulence gene patterns and the adhesion capacity or the percentage of internalization. Biofilm-forming ability did not influence the invasion capacity. Likewise, adherence and invasion capacity may be strain dependent. Significance and Impact of the Study: Findings from this study provide new insights on biofilm and invasion capacity of S. uberis strains.

In this study, two 14-3-3 cDNAs were identified from the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai (designated 14-3-3ζ and 14-3-3ε), possessing 59.40% identity with each other. Both genes were predominantly expressed in the gills of unchallenged abalones, and their mRNA signals could also be detected in several other tissues, including the mantle, hepatopancreas and ovary. However, after Vibrio harveyi challenge, hemocytes were induced significantly (p < 0.01). Meanwhile, phagocytosis was inhibited, but apoptosis, reactive oxygen species formation, and caspase 3 expression were significantly induced (p < 0.01), and they were all suppressed with 14-3-3ζ knockdown (p < 0.01). The differences were that silencing 14-3-3ε reverted the decline in the phagocytic rate derived from bacterial infection, while ROS formation was not influenced significantly. In addition, the expression levels of several antimicrobial peptide and proinflammatory cytokine genes were also decreased with the silencing of 14-3-3 genes. However, with the knockdown of 14-3-3ζ, the expression of 14-3-3ε was further significantly increased (p < 0.01), and vice versa. Overall, our results suggested that 14-3-3ζ and 14-3-3ε should play important roles in innate immunity against V. harveyi infection. © 2021",10.1016/j.dci.2021.104176,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85108645133

The effects of dietary CUR on the survival and growth of the abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) were evaluated by measuring growth, hematological parameters, and the abundance and diversity of gut flora. A total of 720 abalones (shell length: 59.69 ± 0.15 mm, body weight: 24.80 ± 0.20 g) were randomly distributed into six group (six replicates each group), fed six diets containing 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 g/kg of CUR for 100 days. Results indicated that CUR supplementation at 0.1–0.4 g/kg diet improved the growth performance. When the addition of CUR was greater than 0.1 g/kg, the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and total antioxidant capacity in the serum and hepatopancreas were significantly increased, while the contents of malondialdehyde were significantly reduced (P < 0.05). After infection with Vibrio harveyi AP37, the survival rate in all CUR supplementation groups were significantly higher than the control group (P < 0.05), and the highest values of the total hemocyte count, reactive oxygen species, and phagocytic activity were recorded in CUR 0.1 group. In addition, supplementation of the diet with 0.1 g/kg CUR decreased the gut microbial diversity indices and increased the abundance of potentially beneficial genera including Mycoplasma (26.82%), Psychrilyobacter (23.62%) and Vibrio (21.44%). In conclusion, addition of 0.1 g/kg of CUR to the diet not only improved the survival, growth, feed utilization, and regulated gut flora composition of abalone, but also effectively enhanced their antioxidant capacity, cellular immunity and resistance to V. harveyi AP37 infection. Therefore, CUR may be a useful feed additive for abalone aquaculture. © 2022",10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.101336,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138040563

Feed efficiency is an important economic trait for abalone, but little attention has been paid to this trait in breeding programs of Pacific abalone. In this study, the growth and feed efficiency traits of 648 abalone were measured during two time periods (days 1–36 and days 37–72), while an individual-based accurate measurement method of feed efficiency for abalone was established. The residual feed intake (RFI) was first evaluated in abalone; this was significantly correlated between the two periods, while the feed efficiency ratio (FER) was not significantly correlated between the two periods. Genetic analysis showed that RFI exhibited moderate or high heritability, with respective scores of 0.32 and 0.40 in the two periods, and there was a strong positive genetic correlation between the two periods (0.892 ± 0.042). RFI showed weak negative genetic correlations with average daily gain (ADG) during the two growth periods (−0.144 and − 0.008), and a positive genetic correlation with daily feed intake (DFI) (0.901 and 0.794). In addition, a group-feeding experiment were carried out on 12 families. It was found that the body growth and feed intake of abalone were highly correlated with the results of individual-feeding experiment. The results demonstrated that RFI could be used as a suitable trait for indicating the feed efficiency of abalone in future breeding programs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738060,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125114965
Liu Q.; Wu M.; Jiang M.,Arsenolipids in raw and cooked seafood products in southwest China: A non-targeted analysis,2022,Chemosphere,307,,,,135769,"Arsenolipids are the primary form of arsenic in the fat of marine organisms. Because seafood is a common source of arsenic exposure and some arsenolipids are toxic, studying the abundance and species of arsenolipids in seafood is crucial for health risk assessment. Current arsenolipid research is confined by analytical techniques and limited to raw seafood analysis, despite the fact that most seafood is ingested cooked. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate which seafood contributes to arsenolipid dietary intake and investigate the changes in arsenolipids before and after cooking. In Chongqing, China, popular seafood such as clam, shrimp, oyster, abalone, hairtail, and yellow croaker were collected. The raw and cooked samples prepared from these seafood products were examined using a non-targeted screening approach established for arsenolipids, which coupled high-performance liquid chromatography with data-independent high-resolution quadrupole-time-of-flight electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Arsenic-containing hydrocarbons (AsHC330, AsHC332, and AsHC360), arsenic-containing fatty acids (AsFA362, AsFA390, AsFA404, AsFA418, and AsFA422), trimethylarsine oxide, and thiolated trimethylarsinic acid were detected. The species of arsenolipids in each type of seafood remained intact after heating in the microwave oven. In cooked samples, the concentrations of AsFA362 and AsFA390 were significantly lower than in raw samples, whereas the concentrations of other arsenolipids were unchanged. Microwave cooking did not result in the thiolation of the detected arsenolipids. The most detected species in raw and cooked samples were AsFA362, AsFA390, and AsFA418. Most arsenolipid species were found in the highest levels in hairtails and yellow croakers. It is the first time that arsenolipids have been found in the oyster, abalone, abalone liver, and yellow croaker. The present study contributes to a better understanding of arsenolipids exposure from seafood, which is useful for assessing the health risks of arsenic. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.135769,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85135298040

Two Family I84 members, scSI-1 and scSI-2, were reported from the razor clam Sinonovacula constricta in a previous research. In the present study, 12 additional genes, named scSI-3 to scSI-14, were identified via genome wide sequence analyses. Among them, 10 genes were predicted to have a signal sequence, but one (scSI-7) was not. Besides, one sequence (scSI-14) was likely to encode a prematurely terminated peptide. The predicted mature peptides shared characteristics including 12 conserved cysteine residues, isoelectric points of 4.98 to 6.11, and molecular weights of 7.1 to 9.3 kDa with previously reported family members. Four motifs were characterized in 13 predicted mature peptides (with exception of scSI-14), which shared two to four conserved cysteine residues, are possibly to form two functional domain comprised 6 cysteine residues, respectively. At genomic level, all the 14 razor clam Family I84 genes were organized into 3 exons and 2 introns; 13 of them clustered in 3 regions of 100 kb on 3 separate chromosomes, suggesting tandem duplications of related genes. The promoter region of all the 14 genes was predicted to share some transcription factor binding sites, in particular those responsive to pathological and physiological stimuli, but no shared motifs were identified. Analyses also revealed differences in expression patterns among the genes. One gene in a tandem duplicated gene pairs usually showed a higher expression level than the other whereas non-tandem duplicated genes exhibited a higher degree of correlation in expression level. In addition, 8 of the 14 genes demonstrated higher level of expression in Vibrio tolerant clams than in non-tolerant clams following challenges with Vibrio parahaemolyticus. These results generated important information about the evolution of Family I84 protease inhibitors in S. constricta.

A total of 1260 abalone were randomly distributed into 18 net cages (seventy per cage). Five formulated diets were prepared. The control (RCJP0) diet included 20% S. japonica. The percentages of 25, 50, 75 and 100 of S. japonica were substituted with the same amount of RCJP, referred to as the RCJP25, RCJP50, RCJP75 and RCJP100 diets, respectively. Finally, dry S. japonica was prepared to evaluate the formulated diets on growth performance of abalone. Each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate groups of abalone. Abalone were daily fed to satiety with little leftover for 16 weeks. After the 16-week feeding trial, abalone were subjected to air exposure stressor for 20 h, and then survival was monitored for the next 120 h. All formulated diets achieved significantly greater weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) than those of abalone fed the S. japonica. Weight gain and SGR of abalone linearly improved with an increased substitution levels of S. japonica with RCJP in feeds. The greatest weight gain and SGR were obtained in abalone fed the RCJP100 diet. The shell growth and soft body weight of abalone also linearly increased with dietary substitution levels of S. japonica with RCJP. The chemical composition of the soft body of abalone was not affected by the experimental diets. Survival of abalone fed all formulated diets, except for the RCJP0 diet was significantly higher than that of abalone fed the S. japonica at the end of the 120-h post observation. In conclusion, S. japonica could be entirely (100%) replaced with RCJP in formulated abalone diet.

However, the potential for replacing fish meal (FM) with CGM in abalone feeds has not been adequately evaluated. A 110-day feeding trial was conducted to evaluate effects of replacing FM with CGM on abalone Haliotis discus hannai (initial weight: 21.83 ± 0.25 g). The control diet (CGM0) was designed to contain 20% of FM. The other four isonitrogenous (about 30% of crude protein) and isolipidic (about 4% of crude lipid) experimental diets were formulated with CGM protein replacing 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of dietary FM protein, respectively. The five experimental diets were named as CGM0, CGM25, CGM50, CGM75 and CGM100, respectively. Results showed that no significant differences were found in survival rate among all the groups. Weight gain rate (WGR) of abalone in the CGM100 group was significantly lower than that in the control group. There were no significant differences in WGR among the CGM25, CGM50, CGM75 and the control groups. The increasing dietary CGM inclusion level elevated the operational taxonomic units, ACE estimator and Chao1 estimator, and changed the intestinal microbiota composition in abalone. The activities of trypsin, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and Na+, K+-ATPase in digestive gland were significantly decreased when replacement level over 50%. The increasing dietary CGM inclusion level significantly downregulated the expressions of ribosomal S6 protein kinase (s6k), mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eif4e) in digestive gland. The CGM75 and CGM100 groups had significant lower activities of catalase and lysozyme in cell-free hemolymph and digestive gland. In conclusion, CGM could replace 75% of dietary FM (equivalent to 16.2% of CGM inclusion level in the diet) without significantly affecting the growth of abalone. However, high inclusion levels of CGM in diets (> 10.8%) had negative effects on intestinal microbiota, mTOR pathway and immunity in abalone. © 2022 The Authors",10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.101007,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122928155

Sulfated polysaccharide from pacific abalone (AGSP) reduced the level of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and increased the production of short chain fatty acids in the colon of mice, and it reduced the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and increased the IL-10 level in in vitro cell models, suggesting that it can be used as a probiotic agent to inhibit intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, AGSP reduced the disease activity index and intestinal damage, improved the mucosal immune response, and inhibited oxidative damage in mice with DSS-induced acute and chronic colitis, which can be associated with modulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway and gut microbiota. AGSP regulated the structure of the gut microbiota and reduced the level of Bacteroides that had positive correlation with the colitis symptoms. The in vitro result showed that AGSP may inhibit mucin degradation by Bacteroides via the change of the polysaccharide utilization strategy, which can protect intestinal barrier integrity.

Previous studies have found that orange-muscle abalones are rich in carotenoids, but the effects of different diets on the accumulation of carotenoids are unknown. In this study, the effects of macroalgae (Gracilaria lemaneiformis), fresh and dried kelp (Laminaria japonica) on the contents of the predominant carotenoids, including zeaxanthin, β-carotene, and fucoxanthin, between the common and orange-muscle mutant of Haliotis gigantea were compared through a one-year culture experiment. Our study confirmed that carotenoids in abalones mainly come from diets, and the carotenoid types in the muscles were similar to their diets. We also found that feeding on G.lemaneiformis played an important role in maintaining a stable carotenoid content over time, especially zeaxanthin in H.gigantea. Our data also provided that abalones had a good growth performance under the feeding conditions of G.lemaneiformis. Finally, compared with common abalones, orange-muscle abalones had a notably enhanced ability to accumulate carotenoids through their diet, especially zeaxanthin (P<0.01). However, the growth performance of orange-muscle abalones was lower than those of common abalones fed the same diets. These results inferred that the content of carotenoid in abalone may be controlled by genetic factors, and diet had a significant influence on the accumulation of carotenoid in abalone to some extent.  © 2022 Xiaohui Wei et al.",10.1155/2022/9287594,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145930110

In this research, POs were studied in cultured mollusk species, including scallop Chlamys farreri, abalone Haliotis discus hannai and clam Scapharca subcrenata. The POs were isolated from hemocytes using lineargradient native-PAGE combined with catechol staining. The PO activities and their characters were investigated. The molecular mass of PO in C. farreri was 576 kDa, and it was 228 kDa in H. discus hannai. In S. subcrenata, four POs were detected and their molecular masses were 391 kDa, 206 kDa, 174 kDa and <67 kDa, which were named as 391-PO, 206-PO, 174-PO and s-PO, respectively. Kinetic analyses indicated that all of the POs, except for 391-PO had higher affinity to L-DOPA and catechol than to hydroquinone and dopamine. However, all of the POs failed to oxidize tyrosine. The effects of divalent metal ions on POs’ activities were assayed, including Fe2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Cu2+ and Ca2+ from FeCl2, MgSO4, ZnSO4, MnCl2, CuSO4 and CaCl2. The POs were inhibited by Fe2+ at all determined concentrations. Additionally, the inhibition assay showed that all of the POs were inhibited by cysteine, ascorbic acid, sodium sulfite, citric acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium (EDTA) and sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC). The inhibition effects of critric acid and EDTA are dose-dependent. H. discus hannai PO and 391-PO were slightly inhibited by sodium azide, and H. discus hannai PO, 391-PO and 174-PO were slightly inhibited by thiourea. In conclusion, the POs in the three cultured mollusks are copper-containing laccase-type phenoloxidases with similar biochemical characteristics even though their molecular masses are different. © 2022, Ocean University of China, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",10.1007/s11802-022-4808-6,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85126057737

Both the intestines and intestinal microbiota play a key role in energy acquisition and influence FE. In the current research, intestinal microbiota, metabolome, and key digestive enzyme activities were compared between abalones with high [Residual feed intake (RFI) = −0.029] and low FE (RFI = 0.022). The FE of group A were significantly higher than these of group B. There were significant differences in intestinal microbiota structures between high- and low-FE groups, while higher microbiota diversity was observed in the high-FE group. Differences in FE were also strongly correlated to variations in intestinal digestive enzyme activity that may be caused by Pseudoalteromonas and Cobetia. In addition, Saprospira, Rhodanobacteraceae, Llumatobacteraceae, and Gaiellales may potentially be utilized as biomarkers to distinguish high- from low-FE abalones. Significantly different microorganisms (uncultured beta proteobacterium, BD1_7_clade, and Lautropia) were found to be highly correlated to significantly different metabolites [DL-methionine sulfoxide Arg-Gln, L-pyroglutamic acid, dopamine, tyramine, phosphatidyl cholines (PC) (16:0/16:0), and indoleacetic acid] in the high- and low-FE groups, and intestinal trypsin activity also significantly differed between the two groups. We propose that interactions occur among intestinal microbiota, intestinal metabolites, and enzyme activity, which improve abalone FE by enhancing amino acid metabolism, immune response, and signal transduction pathways. The present study not only elucidates mechanisms of variations in abalone FE, but it also provides important basic knowledge for improving abalone FE by modulating intestinal microbiota.

This work aimed to clone, express, purify, and evaluate the protective effect antioxidant of this enzyme on skin cells when fused to transactivator of transcription (TAT) protein transduction domain of HIV-1 and abalone (Ab) peptides to allow cell penetration. TrSOD, TAT-TrSOD-Yfp (fused to yellow fluorescent protein), and Ab-TrSOD were expressed in E. coli and purified as soluble proteins. The cytotoxicity of the enzymes, at the concentrations of 1, 3, and 6 μmol/L, was evaluated for a period of 24 and 48 h of incubation, with no cytotoxic effect on 3T3 fibroblasts. The 3T3 cells were exposed to the oxidant agent tert-butyl hydroperoxide and evaluated for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, in the presence or not of the recombinant enzymes. TAT-TrSOD-Yfp was able to decrease the generation of ROS by 15% when used in the concentrations of 3 and 6 μmol/L in comparison to the control, but there was no difference in relation to the effect of TrSOD. Ab-TrSOD, when compared to TrSOD, promoted a decrease in the formation of ROS of 19% and 14% at the concentrations of 1 and 6 μmol/L, respectively, indicating that this recombinant form was more effective in reducing oxidative stress compared to SOD without the cell-penetrating peptide (CPP). Together, these results indicate that the fusion of SOD with these CPP increased the antioxidant capacity of fibroblasts, identified by the reduction in the generation of ROS. In addition, such molecules, in the concentrations initially used, were not toxic to the cells, opening perspectives for the development of products for antioxidant protection of the skin that may have therapeutic and cosmetic application. © 2022 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",10.1002/bab.2314,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124505610

It was found that ESBM can replace fish meal (FM) either partially or completely in diets for some fish and shrimp species. In the present study, the effects of replacing dietary FM with ESBM on growth performance, intestinal microbiota, immunity and mTOR pathway in abalone Haliotis discus hannai (initial weight: 16.75 ± 0.09 g) were investigated after a 100-day feeding trial. Five experimental diets were designed to replace 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of dietary FM by ESBM, which were named as ESBM0 (control), ESBM25, ESBM50, ESBM75 and ESBM100, respectively. Results showed that ESBM could replace up to 75% of FM in the diet without significant effect on the weight gain rate (WGR, 118.05%–124.16%) of abalone. The increasing dietary ESBM levels significantly decreased the trypsin activity from 418.52 to 286.52 U/mg protein in the digestive gland. No significant differences in the contents of total cholesterol (T-CHO), ammonia (BLA) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in cell-free hemolymph were observed among the groups with replacement levels of dietary FM by ESBM from 0% to 75%. Excessive replacement level of FM with ESBM (ESBM100) significantly increased the MDA content (2.33 nmol/mg prot.) and pro-inflammatory-related gene expression in digestive gland. Compared with the control group, the mTOR pathway in muscle was significantly upregulated in the ESBM75 group. The digestive gland in the ESBM100 group contained more golden refractile spherules than those in the other groups. The abundance of intestinal microbes such as Halomonas, Zobellella and Bacillus was decreased in the ESBM100 group. In conclusion, up to 75% of replacement of dietary FM by ESBM had no negative effects on the growth performance, intestinal microbiota, immunity and mTOR pathway of abalone. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.fsi.2022.08.073,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138805680

Dietary inclusion effect of citrus peel by‐product (CPB) as an additive on the growth, body composition, and various stress resistance of juvenile abalone (Haliotis discus) was investigated, and compared to commercial antioxidant (ethoxyquin). A total of 2880 juvenile (initial weight of 3.3 g) abalone were randomly assigned into 24 net cages. Seven formulated diets supplemented with 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50 g/kg CPB and 0.01 g/kg ethoxyquin were formulated, and referred to as the CPB0, CPB5, CPB10, CPB20, CPB30, CPB50, and EQ diets, respectively. Finally, dry Saccharina japonica was prepared to compare the formulated diets on growth of abalone. All experimental diets were assigned to triplicate groups of abalone. Abalone were daily fed to satiation for 16 weeks. After the 16-week feeding trial, sixty abalone from each cage were subjected to the 20-h air, 12-h low salinity at 25 psu, and 20-h high temperature at 30 °C exposure stressors, respectively, and then survival was monitored. Abalone fed all formulated diets produced superior weight gain, specific growth rate (SGR), shell growth to abalone fed the S. japonica. Dietary inclusion levels of CPB linearly improved weight gain of abalone. However, there was no difference in chemical composition of the soft body of abalone fed all experimental diets. Diets supplemented with CPB or EQ improved survival of abalone when subjected to the 20-h air and high temperature exposures. In conclusion, CPB was a very effective additive as growth enhancer as well as stress reducer in abalone diet. Abalone fed the CPB50 diet attained the highest weight gain, SGR, and stress resistance subjected to the 20-h air and high temperature exposures. © 2022 The Authors",10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.101187,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85131074444

A total of 1260 juvenile abalone was randomly distributed into 18 containers. Five experimental diets were prepared. The control (Con) diet contained 20% S. japonica. Twenty five percent, 50%, 75% and 100% S. japonica were substituted with equal amount of BLB, referred to as the BLB25, BLB50, BLB75 and BLB100 diets, respectively. The dry S. japonica was also prepared to compare effect of formulated diets on growth of abalone. The experimental diets were fed to triplicate groups of abalone for 16 weeks, and then exposed to air for 24 h. Survival of abalone was monitored for the next 6-day post observation period after the 24-h air exposure. Weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone fed with formulated diets were greater than those of abalone fed with the S. japonica. The greatest weight gain and SGR were obtained in abalone fed the BLB25 diet, followed by the BLB50, BLB75, BLB100 and Con diets, in that order. The maximum values of weight gain, SGR, shell length and shell width of abalone were estimated to be approximately 42.3%, 43.5%, 39.8% and 33.7% of substitution level of BLB for S. japonica in abalone feed. The chemical composition of abalone soft body was not affected by the experimental diets. Survival of abalone fed with formulated diets was higher than that of abalone fed with the S. japonica at the end of the 6-day post observation period. In conclusion, S. japonica could be completely replaced with BLB in abalone feed without retardation of growth and survival of abalone subjected to the 24-h air exposure.

Hybridization is a classical breeding method that can effectively improve the genetic characteristics of organisms through heterosis. Abalone has become an increasingly economically important aquaculture resource with high commercial value. However, due to changing climate, abalone is now facing serious threats of high temperature in summer. Interspecific hybrid abalone (Haliotis gigantea ♀ × H. discus hannai ♂, SD) has been cultured at large scale in southern China and has been shown high survival rates under heat stress in summer. Therefore, SD has become a good model material for heterosis research, but the molecular basis of heterosis remains elusive. Results: Heterosis in thermal tolerance of SD was verified through Arrhenius break temperatures (ABT) of cardiac performance in this study. Then RNA-Sequencing was conducted to obtain gene expression patterns and alternative splicing events at control temperature (20 °C) and heat stress temperature (30 °C). A total of 356 (317 genes), 476 (435genes), and 876 (726 genes) significantly diverged alternative splicing events were identified in H. discus hannai (DD), H. gigantea (SS), and SD in response to heat stress, respectively. In the heat stress groups, 93.37% (20,512 of 21,969) of the expressed genes showed non-additive expression patterns, and over-dominance expression patterns of genes account for the highest proportion (40.15%). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the overlapping genes among common DEGs and NAGs were significantly enriched in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, mitophagy, and NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, we found that among these overlap genes, 39 genes had undergone alternative splicing events in SD. These pathways and genes may play an important role in the thermal resistance of hybrid abalone. Conclusion: More alternative splicing events and non-additive expressed genes were detected in hybrid under heat stress and this may contribute to its thermal heterosis. These results might provide clues as to how hybrid abalone has a better physiological regulation ability than its parents under heat stress, to increase our understanding of heterosis in abalone. © 2021, The Author(s).",10.1186/s12864-021-07954-y,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114506801
Cook P.A.,"Introduction, taxonomy, and general biology of abalone",2023,Developments in Aquaculture and Fisheries Science,42,,1,8,," Abalone are marine snails that belong to a group of invertebrates called molluscs, that also include common bivalves such as scallops, oysters, mussels, pippies, and cockles, as well as octopus, squid, and cuttlefish. Abalone have a moderate to heavily calcified snail-like, flattened shell. They belong to the exclusively marine family, Haliotidae and to the single genus-level taxon, Haliotis. There are 56 valid species, with 18 additional subspecies. Abalone shells are flattened, similar to limpets, and have little external signs of coiling. The shell has a wide opening for the body and a single row of respiratory pores along one side that are used in respiration, excretion, and reproduction. The flat body shape of abalone is important in reducing drag forces that are generated by waves that are typical of their shallow, exposed coastal reef habitat. Viewed from the ventral side, the internal anatomy is dominated by a large, flat, muscular foot, surrounded by a pigmented epipodium, which is a flat circle of tissue with sensory tentacles. On temperate and tropical shores, abalone occur from the low intertidal to a depth of about 30 m, especially in areas supporting seaweed beds, where adults are macroalgal herbivores. In most areas where abalone are common, they have formed the basis of important fisheries. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/B978-0-12-814938-6.00001-4,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85164409456

In this study, the chemical and nutritional compositions of abalones were obtained, and three cooking methods, steaming, boiling and frying, were evaluated by in vitro gastric digestion simulation to understand their nutritional changes by 1H NMR spectroscopy combined with multivariate statistical analyses. The nutritional losses were also monitored under different cold storage conditions. The results indicated that boiling can keep more amino acids and fatty acids than steaming and frying, thus being recommended as the best cooking method of abalone. The abalone could maintain fresh within one day under 4 °C, and the deterioration process occurred subsequently. These results help to understand the digestion of cooked abalone and the changes of nutrients through storage and cooking process, leading to a scientific recommendation of cooking method and storage condition for healthy eating. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.132047,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122453668
Dawood M.A.O.,Dietary Copper Requirements for Aquatic Animals: A Review,2022,Biological Trace Element Research,200,12,5273,5282,,"Copper (Cu) is a vital microelement required for the optimum growth performance and wellbeing of aquatic animals. It contributed to various biological, physiological, and metabolic function in the entire body of the aquatic animals. Further, Cu is a cofactor for several enzymes involved in the antioxidation capacity and metalloenzyme formation. Some ingredients used for aquafeed formulation include sufficient amounts of Cu that can provide aquatic animals with their requirements. Nevertheless, in some cases, external Cu sources are needed to optimize the essential needs of aquatic animals. Inorganic, organic, and nano Cu forms are included in aquafeed and result in regulated physiological and biological functions. The addition of Cu should be added at particular doses considering the species, size, duration, and environmental conditions. Water-borne Cu level should also be considered as long as aquatic animals can obtain their requirements through gills to avoid overdosing and toxicity. Several studies reported the optimum doses of Cu required for optimal growth, productivity, and health status in several aquatic animals. This review article presents the up-to-date results of Cu-related studies in aquafeed. It also helps academia design further studies to better understand the border between Cu requirements and toxicity.

A total 353 water-soluble proteins were identified in fresh abalone muscle. The number was decreased to 233 (6 min) and 201 (30 min), and then increased to 271 (240 min) during boiling. The undetectable protein in water-soluble fraction caused by boiling mainly belong to hemocyanins, protein kinases, dehydrogenases, phosphorylases, and transferases, while the newly identified proteins in water-soluble fraction during boiling mainly belong to collagen and myofibrillar proteins (MPs).Additionally, results also showed that boiling caused protein oxidation, denaturation, aggregation, crosslinking and degradation. Combined with the texture changes of abalone muscles during boiling, it was speculated that the oxidation, denaturation, aggregation and crosslinking of proteins led to the increase of shear force, however, the degradation of structural proteins such as MPs and collagen caused the decreases in shear force and hardness. © 2022",10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.133014,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85130081380

More efficient production strategies are necessary to ensure a sustainable mariculture sector, yet the potential of feasible production gains without further environmental impacts is largely unknown. This work took one of the biggest mariculture centers in China to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of mariculture products in 2003, 2010, and 2016, explore potential factors associated with resource use efficiency, and quantify the potential of these factors to increase regional production. The mariculture sector had a rapid expansion in 2003–2010 and accelerated product diversification in 2010–2016, with overall annual growth rates of 4.6%, 24.9%, 14.6%, 20.4%, 24.7%, and 8.7% in finfish (Larimichthys crocea and others), sea cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus), abalone (Haliotis spp.), laminaria (Laminaria japonica), gracilaria (Gracilaria spp.), and porphyra (Porphyra spp.) production, respectively. Resource use impacts were dominated by finfish production (over 90% of the total), but recent increases were mostly due to the farming of other products. Our study also identified several demographic (household size), socioeconomic (income per capita), technical (farming density, feed usage, and energy usage), and environmental (distance between farms and total nitrogen concentration) variables that were correlated with resource use efficiency. Simulations based on regression models suggested that changes in these factors could increase fish and seaweed production by at least 3%–18% and 2%–23%, respectively, without increasing resource use levels. Sustainable intensification of local mariculture systems could be achieved by enhancing the access to more efficient technology and financial capital, increasing the willingness of engagement in the sector, facilitating the transaction of sea use rights, reducing the amount of nutrient released in coastal areas, and including the heterogeneous effects of farm distances and water quality in marine spatial planning. Our results highlight the existing opportunities in policymaking for more sustainable food production systems and the management of coastal ecosystems in mariculture-dominated seascapes. © 2022",10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.130743,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124262166

Artificial diets are suspected to accelerate maturation, in particular when soya meal is used as a protein source, because of this plant’s high concentration of phytoestrogens. The effect of diet on the gonad development of 27-month-old farmed Haliotis midae, raised at two stocking densities, was analysed. We fed two artificial diets and a natural diet, kelp, to cultured abalone. The first artificial diet had fishmeal as its main source of protein, while in the other, Abfeed® S34, 32% of the fish meal was replaced with soya meal. For each gonad sample, the development phase was determined based on both histological criteria and the gonad bulk index (GBIn). The hypothesised link between dietary protein source and gonad development could not be established by either morphological criteria or GBIn. Similarly, stocking density did not have a significant effect on GBIn-values. GBIn values were significantly correlated to the results from the histological analyses in males and females.

It is harvested in Mexico in small amounts for abalone farm fodder and occasionally exported to Asia for human consumption. Because the high-energy environment where it naturally grows limits its sustainable harvest, we explored the domestication and cultivation of this kelp on the west coast of Baja California, Mexico. The life history of E. arborea was completed in the laboratory following traditional methods for kelp cultivation. Gametophytes became reproductive approximately 50 days after spore release and sporophytes were visible to the naked eye after 80 days. When sporophytes reached 2–3 cm, they were transplanted to two sites on long-line systems: in an open bay (Todos Santos Bay) and in a shallow coastal lagoon (San Quintín Bay). At both sites, full differentiation occurred 6 to 8 months after deployment, with fertile blades occurring within a year. Once individuals reached maximum size, blades were harvested by pruning. Monthly, regrowth of pruned blades and new blade addition were measured. Pruned individuals reached the same weight as controls in three months. On the basis of these results, a seasonal seeding program was implemented at a third site where the presence of natural Eisenia is rare due to the lack of hard substrate but was hypothesized to provide appropriate conditions for kelp cultivation (Santa María Bay). Cultures were deployed at three different depths and growth was correlated with season, depth, and temperature. Only cultures seeded in winter developed successfully at this site. This study shows that the culture of E. arborea in a variety of ocean conditions is possible; however, site selection and seasonality are important considerations. Because E. arborea is perennial, it can be harvested periodically during the year thereby increasing yield, and because it is the warmest tolerant kelp species, it is an ideal target for ocean farming and commercial cultivation, considering climate change.

Biomimetic materials are the synthetic materials that possess one or more design and functional aspects of natural materials like abalone nacre, bone, wood. The present research aimed to replicate the inorganic part of nacre, by taking as-synthesized alpha-alumina platelets as primary building blocks. Ice templating was carried out under large vertical temperature gradient in a custom-built setup, that resulted in large-scale ordered lamellar structure; mainly due to the fast and straightforward self-assembly of platelets during directional solidification. The structural wavelength and lamella thickness, the critical parameters to define the ordered lamellar microstructure, were measured to be 16.23 ± 2.0 μm and 2.79 ± 1.0 μm respectively. The resultant green scaffold was subsequently pressed (i.e. cold-compaction) in a direction perpendicular to the ice-front growth and sintered at 1550 °C/4h. Although the nature of the compression response (before and after intermediate cold compaction step) did not change considerably, but large differences in the strength, work of fracture and modulus were obtained.

The shell length of PT5 was the highest (16.38±2.49 mm), and the mortality of CH1 treatment was the lowest (2.007%±0.67%). The addition of P. tricornutum to the feed significantly increased the body weight and weight gain rate, and decreased the feed coefficient. After 40 days of breeding, the SOD activity of PT5 treatment (12.9±0.75 U/mg) and CH5 treatment (12.99±0.42 U/mg) was significantly higher than that of the control group . The T-AOC activity of PT3 and PT5 (1.15±0.03 U/mg,1.19±0.06 U/mg) was significantly higher than that of the control group. The AMS activity of PT5 (4.92±0.74 U/dL) was significantly higher than that of the control group, and there was no significant difference in CL activity among different groups.

The aim of the study is to explore the effects and mechanisms of action of Ziyin Qianyang Formula (ZYQYF) on renal fibrosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Methods. Forty SHRs were randomly divided into a model group, Ziyin Qianyang Formula regular-dose and high-dose groups (ZYQYF-R, 20 g/kg; ZYQYF-H, 40 g/kg), and a western medicine group (enalapril 10 mg/kg), and 10 Sprague-Dawley rats were selected as the normal group. The rats received continuous gavage administration for 6 weeks and systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurements were obtained every fortnight. The serum levels of urea, serum creatinine (sCr), and uric acid (UA) were measured; the pathological morphology and collagen content of the kidneys were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Masson staining; and the serum Ang II level was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, Smad-2, Smad-3, and Smad-7 protein and mRNA expressions in kidney tissues was evaluated by western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results. The ZYQYF-H group showed significantly a lower renal weight and renal weight/body weight than the model group. The enalapril and ZYQYF-H groups showed significantly lower SBP than other groups after 6 weeks of administration. The ZYQYF-H group showed better improvement than the ZYQYF-R and enalapril groups in glomerular and tubular morphology and better reductions in inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen volumetric fraction. The ZYQYF-H group also showed better reductions in serum UA and Ang II levels; collagen-I, collagen-III, and p-Smad2/Smad-2 protein expression; and Smad-2 mRNA expression and a better increase in Smad-7 protein and mRNA expression than the enalapril group. Besides, the degree of renal function and fibrosis improvement was positively correlated with the dose of ZYQYF. Conclusion. ZYQYF can significantly reduce SHR blood pressure, protect renal function and structure, and improve renal fibrosis by regulating Smad proteins through TGF-β1.  © 2022 Hui Xu et al.",10.1155/2022/6088673,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85142434220

Currently, summer mortality caused by high temperature, is one of the biggest challenges for abalone aquaculture industry. The hybrid abalone (Haliotis discus hannai ♀ × H. fulgens ♂) was conferred on the “new variety”. It has heterosis for thermal tolerance and has been cultured at large-scale in southern China. In this study, a transcriptome analysis was performed to identify the related genes in this hybrid abalone under thermal stress and recovery stage. Compared to control group (18°C), a total of 75, 2173, 1050, 1349, 2548, 494, and 305 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at 21°C, 24°C, 27°C, 30°C, 32°C, 29°C, and 26°C, respectively. In this study, 24°C is the critical temperature at which the abalone is subjected to thermal stress. With the temperature rising, the number of stress-responsive genes increased. During the temperature recovering to the optimum, the number of stress-responsive genes decreased gradually. Thus, this hybrid abalone has a rapid response and strong adaptability to the temperature. Under the thermal stress, the abalone triggered a complicated regulatory network including degrading the misfolded proteins, activating immune systems, negative regulation of DNA replication, and activating energy production processes. The more quickly feedback regulation, more abundant energy supply and more powerful immune system might be the underlying mechanisms to fight against thermal stress in this hybrid abalone. These findings could provide clues for exploring the thermal-response mechanisms in abalone. The key genes and pathways would facilitate biomarker identification and thermal-tolerant abalone breeding studies.

Its ability to synthesise the protein has eluded the scientists despite hemocyanin’s importance as a carrier protein and complex molecule with anti-viral activity. Although a hypothetical model of hemocyanin release from the rhogocytes lacunae was proposed based on colloid-osmotic pressure mechanism, lack of in vitro studies limits further validation of this model. In this study, we aim to investigate the impact of cell culture conditions and nature of hemocyanin biosynthesis of rhogocyte cells dissociated from Haliotis laevigata mantle tissue. Population of cells with different hemocyanin expression levels was profiled using flow cytometry, while hemocyanin concentrations in the media were elucidated by ELISA assay. We demonstrated that addition of lipoprotein supplement into the media resulted in a burst secretion of hemocyanin into the culture media. Over 7 days of culture, the population of cells tagged with hemocyanin antibody increased steadily while hemocyanin release in the media decreased significantly. Variation of culture medium, temperature, growth supplement type and concentration also impacted the cell growth and hemocyanin biosynthesis. These results indicated the possibility of an active process triggered by the addition of supplement to synthesise the protein at the highest amount during the first hour. The current study provides a glimpse of the hemocyanin biosynthesis by rhogocyte that may be significant to understand the cell ability to synthesise supramolecular protein and secretion through lacunae. © 2022, The Author(s).",10.1007/s00441-022-03577-1,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123920186

The mucus from Helix aspersa snail is a mixture of bioactive molecules with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects. So far there are no data concerning the capacity of snail extract (SE) to affect neurodegenerative disorders. Objective: The effects of SE from Helix aspersa on learning and memory deficits in Alzheimer's type dementia (ATD) induced by scopolamine (Sco) in male Wistar rats were examined and some mechanisms of action underlying these effects were evaluated. Methods: SE (0.5 mL/100 g) was applied orally through a food tube for 16 consecutive days: 5 days before and 11 days simultaneously with Sco (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). At the end of Sco treatment, using behavioral methods, we evaluated memory performance. Additionally, in cortex and hippocampus the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, acetylcholine and monoamines (dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin) content, levels of main oxidative stress markers, and expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were determined. Results: We demonstrated that, according to all behavioral tests used, SE significantly improved the cognitive deficits induced by Sco. Furthermore, SE possessed AChE inhibitory activity, moderate antioxidant properties and the ability to modulate monoamines content in two brain structures. Moreover, multiple SE applications not only restored the depressed by Sco expression of CREB and BDNF, but significantly upregulated it. Conclusion: Summarizing results, we conclude that complex mechanisms underlie the beneficial effects of SE on impaired memory in Alzheimer's type dementia.  © 2022-IOS Press.

This study examines the impact of a 5 °C temperature increase over ambient conditions for six weeks on the metabolic rates, digestive enzyme activities in the digestive gland, and digestive efficiency of Red Abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and Pāua (H. iris) on their natural diets. We test the hypothesis that abalone digestive function can keep pace with this increased metabolic demand in two separate experiments, one for each species. H. iris had higher food intake in the heat treatment. Both species had higher metabolic rates in the heat treatment with Q10 = 1.73 and Q10 = 2.46 for H. rufescens and H. iris, respectively. Apparent organic matter digestibility, protein digestibility, and carbohydrate digestibility did not differ between the heat treatment and the ambient (control) treatment in either experiment. H. rufescens exhibited higher maltase, alanine-aminopeptidase, and leucine-aminopeptidase activities in the heat treatment. Amylase, β-glucosidase, trypsin, and alkaline phosphatase activities in the digestive gland tissue did not differ between temperature treatments. H. iris exhibited lower amylase and β-glucosidase activities in the heat treatment, while maltase, trypsin, leucine-aminopeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase activities did not differ between treatments.

In this work, the anisotropic microscopic deformation and the resulting macroscopic mechanical properties are evaluated under different loading conditions. Our in situ transmission electron microscopy deformation experiments and finite element simulations reveal that nacre possesses enhanced indentation resistance along the direction normal to the tablets through delocalization of indentation-induced deformation by taking advantage of its layered structure. In addition, nacre's ability to recover from large deformations is observed. We study the strong loading direction dependence of nacre's macroscopic mechanical properties and elucidate the underlying microscopic deformation patterns in the tablets and the soft matrix. Particularly, its performance along the transverse direction is optimized to withstand the loading conditions in nature. We show the importance of the vertical matrix for the initial stiffness and fracture toughness of the composite. These findings provide guidelines for designing nacre-inspired artificial composites with enhanced mechanical properties. Statement of significance: Nacre is widely recognized as an excellent structural model for designing bio-inspired tough and strong artificial composites. Due to its brick-and-mortar microstructure, it exhibits loading direction-dependent mechanical behavior. In this contribution, we investigate the macroscopic mechanical properties and microscopic deformation behavior of nacre under different loading conditions by means of in situ TEM deformation tests and FE simulations. It is found that effective elastic moduli and microscopic deformation strongly depend on the loading direction. The organic matrix is highly deformable. The indentation resistance along the direction normal to tablets is enhanced via deformation delocalization.

Abalones (initial weight: 10.98 ± 0.05 g) were fed with graded levels of dietary lipid, which were 15.73, 23.41, 31.72, 38.25, 46.35, 55.63, 61.70 and 67.19 g/kg. Results showed that compared with the treatment with 38.25 g/kg of dietary lipid, 67.19 g/kg of dietary lipid increased the cumulative mortality of abalone after a challenge with Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Meanwhile, 67.19 g/kg of dietary lipid decreased the activities of lysozyme (LZ) and acid phosphatase (ACP) in serum, and the mRNA levels of β-defensin and mytimacin 6 in hepatopancreas of abalone. The mRNA levels of tumour necrosis factor α (tnfα), activator protein 1 (ap-1), nuclear factor κB (nf-κb), interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase-4 (irak4), myeloid differentiation primary response protein MyD88 (myd88), toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2), tlr4 and perilipin-2, and the protein level of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), TNFα, NF-κBp65, AP-1, MyD88 and Perilipin-2 in hepatopancreas were up-regulated by 67.19 g/kg of dietary lipid. However, the mRNA levels of arginase and inhibitor of κBα (iκbα) were down-regulated. Besides, 67.19 g/kg of dietary lipid up-regulated the mRNA levels of executor apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase 3 (caspase-3), caspase-7 and B-cell lymphoma protein-2-associated X protein (bax), and the protein levels of caspase-3 and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) in hepatopancreas. Moreover, high dietary lipid level down-regulated the mRNA levels of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (cuznsod), manganese superoxide dismutase (mnsod), catalase (cat), glutathione peroxidase (gpx), glutathione-S-transferase (gst) and NF-E2-related factor 2 (nrf2), while up-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in hepatopancreas. It was concluded that a high level (67.19 g/kg) of dietary lipid decreased the immunity of abalone, which might be related to the aggravated inflammation and apoptosis, and decreased anti-oxidative capacity under Perilipin-2/TLRs/MyD88/IRAK4/(NF-κB or AP-1), JNK/Bcl-2/Bax and Keap1/Nrf2 signalling. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",10.1111/anu.13339,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115213732

Eight experimental diets with graded levels of carbohydrates (18.08%, 22.10%, 26.10%, 29.90%, 34.00%, 38.01%, 41.98% and 45.55%, named as T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7 and T8, respectively) were designed to feed abalone (initial weight 22.52 ± 0.05 g) for 110 days. The results showed that the diet containing 38.01% carbohydrate significantly increased the survival rate (SR) and weight gain rate (WGR) of abalone (P < 0.05). Based on the quadratic regression mode of WGR, the optimal dietary carbohydrate level for abalone was estimated to be 37.05%. The activities of intestinal digestive enzymes were significantly increased in the T6 group. Moreover, the expressions of pyruvate kinase (pk) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pdh) in digestive glands were up-regulated with the increase of carbohydrate content in diets, while the expression of hexokinase (hk) reached the maximum in the T6 group. The highest expressions of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pepck), glucose-6-phosphatase (g6pase) and insulin signaling pathway related genes were found in the T6 group. The expressions of key genes related to lipolysis reached the highest in the T6 group, and then down-regulated with the further increasing dietary carbohydrate levels. The expression of key genes of lipogenesis was up-regulated with the increasing dietary carbohydrate levels. In conclusion, 38.01% of dietary carbohydrate level improved the growth performance of abalone. Dietary carbohydrate levels influenced the glucose and lipid metabolism including insulin signaling pathway. Abalone potentially had the capability to deal with a high-carbohydrate load (45.55%) by increasing glycolysis and decreasing gluconeogenesis. Meanwhile, it promoted lipid synthesis and inhibited lipolysis under high dietary carbohydrate load. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738284,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85129665161

Relying on coastal waters, the aquaculture area has suffered ecological and economic losses caused by hypoxia, especially in summer. In this study, to investigate the stress resistance of the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai (DD) and the hybrid H. discus hannai ♀ × H. fulgens ♂ (DF), a combination of physiological, biochemical, and metabolomic methods were used to compare the metabolic responses of these two abalones to acute hypoxia (~0.5 mg O2/L, 12 h) and reoxygenation (~6.6 mg O2/L, 10–20 h). Hemolymph characteristics and aerobic/anaerobic respiratory capacity changed significantly under hypoxia or reoxygenation conditions, and they were regulated in different trends in two abalones. The contents of hepatopancreas glycogen in two abalones reached the trough after 10 h recovery, implying that short-term hypoxia leads to a long-lasting (several hours) imprint on the energy storage of abalone. In response to dissolved oxygen fluctuation, metabolic profiles of two abalones changed in distinct ways both in the hypoxia group or the reoxygenation group. The conversion of carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism indicated that hypoxia prompts abalone to change the way of energy metabolism, which may also reflect the difference in the energy utilization of DD and DF abalones. In addition, 3 metabolites (L-glutamate, 2-hydroxy-butanoic acid, and 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid) as potential biomarkers for hypoxia and reoxygenation response in abalone were determined by operating characteristic analysis (ROC). Overall, this study provides information towards understanding the damage caused by frequent hypoxic events and implies the metabolic shifts that occur under hypoxia and reoxygenation conditions in DD and DF abalones. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148698,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85108880420

In the current study, multidrug-resistant Vibrio natriegens strain AbY-1805 was isolated and tentatively identified as a pathogen causing the death of juvenile Pacific abalones (Haliotis discus hannai Ino). In order to apply phage therapy, instead of antibiotics, to treat and control V. natriegens infections in marine aquaculture environments, a lytic phage, vB_VnaS-L3, was isolated. It could effectively infect V. natriegens AbY-1805 with a short latent period (40 min) and high burst size (~890 PFU/cell). Treatment with vB_VnaS-L3 significantly reduced the mortality of juvenile abalones and maintained abalone feeding capacity over a 40-day V. natriegens challenge experiment. Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses suggested that vB_VnaS-L3 was a novel marine Siphoviridae-family phage. Furthermore, vB_VnaS-L3 had a narrow host range, possibly specific to the pathogenic V. natriegens strains. It also exhibited viability at a wide range of pH, temperature, and salinity. The short latent period, large burst size, high host specificity, and broad environmental adaptation suggest that phage vB_VnaS-L3 could potentially be developed as an alternative antimicrobial for the control and prevention of marine animal infections caused by pathogenic V. natriegens. © 2022 by the authors.",10.3390/biology11111670,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149446354

As light quality is the most important environmental factor for the photosynthetic organism, and blue light is a main spectrum for photosynthesis and metabolite accumulation in plants, we test blue light for their effects on the G. lemaneiformis. Results showed that the relative growth rate of G. lemaneiformis decreased while the principal economical metabolites, including agar, polysaccharides were accumulated significantly under blue light. To further understand the response mechanism of G. lemaneiformis to blue light, the omics analysis was used, which revealed that blue light redirected metabolic pathways toward the synthesis of diverse primary and secondary metabolic products, divided into four categories, including photosynthesis, antioxidant system, energy metabolism and carbohydrate synthesis. Among them, the genes encoding photosynthetic pigments and phycobiliproteins increased significantly, but the carbon fixation pathway, the ASA-GSH cycle, and TCA cycle were down-regulated, and more carbon flowed into the synthesis pathway of agar and polysaccharides, which were consistent with the changes of physiological parameters. These findings helped us to understand the mechanism of G. lemaneiformis responding to blue light and provide a new perspective for the culture of high-agar content G. lemaneiformis. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.algal.2022.102760,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85132229916

Each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate cages (5 layers, each layer was 40 cm × 35 cm × 14 cm) with 80 abalones per cage. At the end of the feeding trial, abalones were fasted for 72 h and anesthetized with 5% alcohol. Results showed that final body weight and biomass gain (BG) increased first and thereafter decreased, where the break-points (34.11 g and 934.41 g, respectively) were found in the 1.68% dietary arginine group. Based on the broken-line regression analysis of BG, the optimal dietary arginine level for abalone was estimated to be 1.64% of dry diet. Abalone fed with 2.47% of dietary arginine showed higher crude protein content in the soft body (17.59% wet weight) than other groups. The crude lipid content had a decreasing trend (from 2.02 to 1.28% wet weight) with increasing dietary arginine. The concentration of total free essential amino acids in hemolymph was significantly higher in 1.68% (207.30 μg/mL), 2.19% (199.17 μg/mL) and 2.47% (216.30 μg/mL) dietary arginine groups than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Activities of alanine aminotransferase, total nitric oxide synthase, total anti-oxidative capacity, lysozyme, and the contents of nitric oxide, total protein and albumin were significantly increased as dietary arginine levels increasing from 1.17% to 1.68% and then decreased (P < 0.05). In the digestive gland, the genes expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase were significantly increased in 1.68% dietary arginine group compared with that in the control group (P < 0.05), while the gene expression of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 showed an opposite trend. Meanwhile, the gene expression of tumor necrosis factor-α was decreased in 1.36% to 2.82% dietary arginine levels, and the gene expression of Arginase-I was increased in the 1.68% dietary arginine group. The cumulative mortality of abalone challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus (1.0 × 107 cfu/mL) for seven days was significantly decreased in the 1.68% dietary arginine group (36.67%) compared with those in the other groups except for the group with 2.19% of dietary arginine. In conclusion, dietary arginine level (1.68%) improved the growth, anti-oxidative capacity, immunity and disease resistance of abalone. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737707,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119900287

To measure tauropine in the blood, it was derivatized with phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC), and PITC-tauropine was separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and detected by ultraviolet absorbance. Tauropine was detectable in the blood obtained from mice intraperitoneally injected with tauropine. However, it was not detectable in blood obtained from orally treated mice.

The direct effects of climate change on the biology of marine organisms are often well documented; yet, knowledge on the indirect effects, particularly through trophic interactions, is largely lacking. We provide evidence of ocean warming decoupling critical trophic interactions supporting a commercially important mollusc in a climate change hotspot. Dietary assessments of the Australian blacklip abalone (Haliotis rubra) indicate primary dependency on a widespread macroalgal species (Phyllospora comosa) which we show to be in state of decline due to ocean warming, resulting in abalone biomass reductions. Niche models suggest further declines in P. comosa over the coming decades and ongoing risks to H. rubra.

However, bacterial and viral infection often leads to its high mortality and serious economic losses. In this study, transcriptome sequencing was performed on gill of abalone challenged by Vibrio parahaemolyticus for 0 h (control group, A0h), 8 h (A8h), and 48 h (A48h), respectively. Each library has an average of 53,361,675 clean reads. Approximately 85.71% reads were mapped to the reference genome of Haliotis discus hannai Ino. In comparison with A0h group, 7,656 and 2,789 genes were differentially expressed in the A8h and A48h groups, respectively. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mostly enriched in oxidation–reduction process and oxidoreductase activity from GO analysis as well as immunity and metabolism-related pathways from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis. Cluster analysis demonstrated that all DEGs were categorized into eight subclusters by adopting the gene expression model. Specifically, a total of 1,070 significantly downregulated genes from two clusters were related to some metabolic pathways, ABC transporters, and cell adhesion. Moreover, 212 upregulated genes in one subcluster were enriched in several immune-related pathways, including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling pathway and apoptosis. Some members of the pattern recognition receptors family, which can initiate inflammatory signaling and induce apoptosis, were stimulated to upregulate in gill after challenge including C1q, perlucin, and low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein. In addition, caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway was inactive, whereas caspase-independent apoptosis pathway was stimulating in response to Vibrio challenge. To eliminate invading pathogen, the immune effectors such as interleukin-17, matrix metalloproteinase, lysozyme, superoxide, and ferritin were also stimulated in gill. Moreover, this study also provides more information for comprehending the immunity and defense mechanisms against V. parahaemolyticus infection in abalone.

Tunic meal of sea squirt (TSS) is one of the marine fishery by-products that contains a variety of nutrients. In this study, we evaluated TSS as a substitute for FM and MA in abalone (Haliotis discus) diet. A total of 27,600 abalones was distributed into 36 net cages (2300 abalones in 3 cages/diet). Two-way [substitution source (FM and MA), and substitution ratio (50% and 100%)] ANOVA with the repeated design was used. Extruded pellets (EPs) were made up of the control diet (Con), which contained 14% FM, and 25% MA. Fifty, and 100% of both FM and MA were substituted with an equal amount of TSS, referred to as the FM50, FM100, MA50, and MA100 diets, respectively. Undaria pinnatifida was prepared to compare the effect of EPs on abalone. All experimental diets were fed to duplicate groups of abalone for 33 weeks. After the 16-week feeding trial, abalone were subjected to air, high temperature, and low salinity exposures for 24-h, and then monitored for survival. Weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone fed with the MA50 and MA100 diets were greater than those of abalone fed with all other diets, except for SGR of abalone fed with the Con diet. Chemical composition of the soft body of abalone was reflected from the dietary nutrient composition. Abalone fed the MA50 diet achieved the highest survival after the 24-h air and high-temperature exposures. Conclusively, the desirable level of substituting tunic meal of sea squirt for FM is up to 50% and 100% for MA, respectively, in extruded pellet. © 2022 The Authors",10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.100935,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118825003

Xc) system, the Ca. Xc bacterium infects abalone digestive tissues and leads to extreme starvation and a characteristic “withering” of the gastropod foot. First identified in black abalone in California after an El Niño event, withering syndrome (WS) has caused large declines in wild black and captive white abalone on the northeastern Pacific coast, but disease resistance levels are species-, and possibly population-specific. This study compared gene expression patterns in the digestive gland of Ca. Xc-exposed and unexposed (control) Pinto abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana), a particularly susceptible species. Lab-induced Ca. Xc infections were followed over 7 months and RNAseq was used to identify differential gene expression. Exposed Pinto abalone showed distinct changes in expression of 68 genes at 3 and 7 months post-infection relative to those in control animals. Upregulation of an orexin-like receptor (which is involved in feeding signaling) and a zinc peptidase-like region (many amino peptidases are zinc peptidases) in animals infected for 7 months indicates that animals with Ca. Xc infection may be starving and upregulating processes associated with feeding and digestion. Other groups of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were upregulated or downregulated across control and exposed individuals over the 7-month experiment, including DEG groups that likely correspond to early disease state and to general stress response of being held in captivity. No patterns emerged in genes known to be involved in molluscan immune response, despite this being an expectation during a 7-month infection; digestion-related genes and unannotated DEGs were identified as targets for future research on potential immune response to WS in abalone. © 2021 The Authors",10.1016/j.cbd.2021.100930,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120977132

Serial depletion of pāua (abalone, Haliotis iris), a cultural keystone for Māori in Aotearoa New Zealand, threatens Indigenous practices and values. Kāti Huirapa Rūnaka ki Puketeraki, a hapū (subtribe) of Ngāi Tahu, have struggled for over 30 years to address loss of local pāua populations. Regulations introduced by the East Otago Taiāpure, a customary fishery management area established in 1999, recognise Indigenous rights to access and manage marine resources. Despite concerted efforts to rebuild pāua populations while allowing fishing, pāua have continued to decline and the fishery was closed in 2019. A wealth of mātauranga (Māori knowledge) surrounds enhancement practices for pāua. Here, mātauranga relating to translocation was collated through interviews and applied, in conjunction with additional knowledge bases, to translocate pāua from reefs threatened by sand inundation to more accessible but historically overexploited bays. In total, 420 pāua, translocated across 21 sites, were monitored for a 2-week period, after which aggregations returned to pretranslocation densities. Total mortality reached 8.8% over this time, attributed primarily to predation by the sea star Astrostole scabra. Results suggest that translocation may not be suitable for creating artificial aggregations using the methods applied; however, it could address other management concerns, hence suggestions are made for methodological improvements. The interaction between pāua and A. scabra demonstrates the need for continued transformation in management to allow for the application of a multispecies integrated approach in the restoration of pāua. © 2021 CSIRO.",10.1071/PC20058,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111844114

The crude fat of abalone visceral was taken as raw material, and crude phospholipids were extracted with acetone, and then according to the principle that the solubility of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in lower alcohols is higher than that of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), the crude phospholipids were further separated and concentrated with ethanol to obtain purer phospholipids. According to the results of univariate test, the volume fraction of ethanol, the extraction time of ethanol and the material-liquid ratio of crude phospholipid to ethanol were selected as the indexes, and the mathematical regression model of phospholipid yield to ethanol concentration, extraction time, and material-liquid ratio of crude phospholipid to ethanol was designed in orthogonal experiments, and the optimal process conditions were as follows: the liquid-material ratio of acetone to crude fat of abalone visceral crude fat during the preparation of crude phospholipids was 9 ∶ 1, the number of extractions was three times, and the extraction time of acetone was 40 min. During the purification of phospholipids, the volume fraction of ethanol was 92%, the extraction time was 41 min, and the ratio of ethanol to crude phospholipids was 10 ∶1, under these conditions, the yield of phospholipids in internal organs could reach (28. 72±0. 68)%. The determination of the antioxidant capacity of abalone visceral phospholipids showed that the reducing power, hydroxyl free radical scavenging ability and DPPH scavenging ability of abalone visceral phospholipids were enhanced with the increase of abalone visceral phospholipid concentration, and abalone visceral phospholipids had certain antioxidant effects in soybean oil and rapeseed oil, among which in rapeseed oil, when the addition amount of phospholipid reached 0. 5%, its antioxidant effect on oil was similar to that of 0. 02% TBHQ added, showing a certain antioxidant capacity. This study studied the antioxidant activity and anti-oil oxidation ability of abalone visceral phospholipids in vitro, which provided a scientific theoretical basis for the further development and utilization of abalone visceral waste. © The Author(s) 2023.",10.16433/j.1673-2383.2023.03.002,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85172311857

Using a video surveillance system, the current study showed that the feeding behaviors of DD and DF exhibited an obvious circadian rhythm, with significantly more feeding at night by DD and DF than during the day. In addition, the amount of time feeding by DF during the day and at night was significantly higher compared with that of DD, especially at ZT8 (20:00), ZT12 (24:00), ZT16 (04:00), and ZT20 (08:00), with the proportion of time feeding by DF increasing 2.22-, 1.60-, 2.71-, and 2.40-fold compared with those of DD, respectively. The maximum values of pepsase activity in DD and DF, of α-amylase activity in DD, and of alginate lyase activity in DF coincided with the peak feeding period. Relative to the changes in expression levels of neuropeptide Y receptor (NPYR) in the intestine, diurnal changes in NPYR expression levels in cerebral ganglia were consistent with the changes in feeding behavior, being highest at 24:00 h in both DD and DF and then declining. There was no significant difference in the circadian expression levels of cholecystokinin receptor (CCKR) in the cerebral ganglia, whereas, in the intestinal tract, peak CCKR expression levels coincided with its anorexigenic effect; the expression levels of CCKR in the intestinal tract exhibited a significant circadian rhythm in DD. These results explain the growth advantage of DF over DD in terms of feeding behavior and digestive physiology, and support the hypothesis that diurnal changes in feeding-related genes in the nervous and digestive systems are correlated with the initiation of abalone feeding behavior. Our findings also provide guidance for developing a suitable feeding strategy for, and improving the efficiency of, the production of abalone. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738158,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85126705382

The control diet was designed to contain 30% of kelp, and named as Diet-S. On the basis of the control diet, the kelp was 50% replaced by U. prolifera, U. lactuca, and G. lemaneiformis, and named as Diet-SE, Diet-SU, and Diet-SG, respectively. Results showed that the specific growth rate of abalone was not significantly influenced by the replacement of dietary kelp (P > 0.05). Dietary inclusion of U. lactuca and G. lemaneiformis significantly increased the feed efficiency but significantly decreased the feed intake of abalone (P < 0.05). Compared with those in the Diet-S group, the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, the total anti-oxidative capacity and lysozyme had the significantly higher values in cell-free haemolymph of abalone fed with Diet-SE, Diet-SU, and Diet-SG (P < 0.05). In addition, the expressions of tumor necrosis factor α and nuclear factor κB in gill and digestive gland were reduced in the Diet-SE, Diet-SU, and Diet-SG groups. The expressions of heat shock proteins in digestive gland were increased significantly in Diet-SG group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the cumulative mortality of abalone after the heat stress was decreased significantly in the Diet-SG group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, replacement of dietary kelp by U. prolifera, U. lactuca, and G. lemaneiformis did not significantly influence the growth performance, but significantly increased the anti-oxidative capacity and immune response of abalone. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",10.1007/s10811-021-02592-z,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114883019

Reducing the adverse effects of high stocking density while maintaining high biomass is essential to address these problems. Here, we conducted a laboratory experiment to simulate the multi-layer culture for sea urchins at ambient high temperatures (from 22.2 to 24.5 °C) in summer for ~ 7 weeks. Survival, body size, lantern growth, gut weight, food consumption, Aristotle's lantern reflex, 5-hydroxytryptamine concentration, pepsin activity and gut morphology were subsequently evaluated. The present study found that multi-layer culture led to significantly larger body size than those without multi-layer culture (the control group). This was probably because of the greater feeding capacity (indicated by lantern growth and Aristotle's lantern reflex) and food digestion (indicated by morphology and pepsin activity of gut) in the multi-layer cultured sea urchins. These results indicate that multi-layer is an effective approach to improving the growth efficiency of sea urchins at high temperatures. We assessed whether eliminating interaction further improve these commercially important traits of sea urchins in multi-layer culture. This study found that eliminating interactions displayed greater body size and Aristotle's lantern reflex than those not separated in the multi-layer culture. This approach also significantly reduced the morbidity compared with the control group. These novel findings indicate that eliminating interactions in multi-layer culture greatly contributes to the growth and disease prevention of sea urchins at high temperatures. The present study establishes a new technique for the longline culture of sea urchins in summer and provides valuable information into the longline culture management of other commercially important species (e.g. scallops, abalones and oysters). © 2021, The Author(s).",10.1038/s41598-021-94546-1,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111170458

A 3×6 factorial design feeding trial was conducted with three water temperatures (19°C, 23°C, and 27°C) and six protein levels (152.5, 202.5, 252.6, 302.6, 352.7, and 402.7 g/kg) for 90 days. Dietary protein levels and temperature significantly affected the growth performance of the hybrid abalones, but there was no interaction effect except for daily increment in shell length. Body moisture decreased with increasing water temperature, and crude protein showed a contrary tendency. Crude lipid and ash were not affected by dietary protein level or water temperature. The alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase activities and the triglyceride content in serum increased with increasing water temperature, whereas the opposite was true for albumin activity and total protein and glucose contents. Total cholesterol contents decreased with increasing dietary protein levels. Dietary protein levels and water temperature did not affect contents of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P>0.05). A significant interaction was observed between dietary protein levels and water temperature in all antioxidation parameters (reactive oxygen species, total antioxidant capacity, protein carbonyl, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione s-transferase, and glutathione peroxidase except for malondialdehyde content). Based on specific growth rate, the optimal dietary protein levels for juvenile hybrid abalones were 333.1, 318.6, and 306.3 g protein/kg diet at 19°C, 23°C, and 27°C, respectively.

Little M.P.; Rosenberg P.S.; Arsham A.,Alternative stopping rules to limit tree expansion for random forest models,2022,Scientific Reports,12,1,,,15113,"Random forests are a popular type of machine learning model, which are relatively robust to overfitting, unlike some other machine learning models, and adequately capture non-linear relationships between an outcome of interest and multiple independent variables. There are relatively few adjustable hyperparameters in the standard random forest models, among them the minimum size of the terminal nodes on each tree. The usual stopping rule, as proposed by Breiman, stops tree expansion by limiting the size of the parent nodes, so that a node cannot be split if it has less than a specified number of observations. Recently an alternative stopping criterion has been proposed, stopping tree expansion so that all terminal nodes have at least a minimum number of observations. The present paper proposes three generalisations of this idea, limiting the growth in regression random forests, based on the variance, range, or inter-centile range. The new approaches are applied to diabetes data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and four other datasets (Tasmanian Abalone data, Boston Housing crime rate data, Los Angeles ozone concentration data, MIT servo data). Empirical analysis presented herein demonstrate that the new stopping rules yield competitive mean square prediction error to standard random forest models. In general, use of the intercentile range statistic to control tree expansion yields much less variation in mean square prediction error, and mean square prediction error is also closer to the optimal.

Desai A.S.; Reddy V.K.,Seaweeds derived by-products,2023,Applications of Seaweeds in Food and Nutrition,,,225,234,,"In terms of volume, farmed seaweeds in 2018 made up 97.1% of the combined 32.4 million tonnes of wild-collected and cultivated aquatic algae. A comparatively small number of nations, mostly those in East and Southeast Asia, practice seaweed farming. Between 2000 and 2018, the global output of marine macroalgae, sometimes known as seaweed, increased by more than thrice, from 10.6 million tonnes to 32.4 million tonnes. The trade of seaweeds in 2018 was of USD 2 billion. Seaweeds dominate aquacultured aquatic algae, which have shown very slow growth in recent years. Some of the 32.4 million tonnes of farmed seaweed produced in 2018 (such as Undaria pinnatifida, Porphyra spp., and Caulerpa spp., produced in East and Southeast Asia) are produced primarily for human consumption, though low-quality products and factory scraps are used for other things, such as abalone culture feed. In fact, seaweed production decreased by 0.7% in 2018. This shift was mostly brought on by Southeast Asia's decreased production and the slow growth of tropical seaweed species, while the production of temperate and coldwater species from seaweed farming was still increasing. The major factor behind the rise in farmed seaweed production over the past 10years, despite a recent slowdown in growth rates, has been the rapid expansion of the farming of tropical seaweed species in Indonesia (Kappaphycus alvarezii and Eucheuma spp.) as a source of raw materials for the extraction of carrageenan. From less than four million tonnes in 2010 to over 11 million tonnes in 2015 and 2016, with comparable production levels in 2017 and 2018, Indonesia boosted its seaweed farming output. Due to secrecy, only a few producing nations in Europe and North America have reported much information on small-scale seaweed growing. To promote and monitor the development of a bioeconomy that is climate and environmentally sustainable, seaweed farming is nevertheless receiving more and more attention. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Deng Q.; Yang D.; He J.; Liu X.; Chen L.,Response of juvenile abalone of Haliotis discus hannai to the combined stress of ocean acidification and deltamethrin; [皱纹盘鲍稚鲍对海水酸化与溴氰菊酯复合胁迫的响应],2022,Journal of Fisheries of China,46,11,2097,2106,,"Since the industrial revolution, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has been rising due to the heavy use of fossil fuel and deforestation. As the oceans and atmosphere exchange gases, the pH of seawater decreases. According to the IPCC, if CO2 emissions are not effectively reduced, the global surface seawater pH will fall to 7.7 by the 21st century and 7.4 by 2300. Acidification is a growing concern because of the damage it can cause to marine life. In addition, ocean acidification often does not occur in isolation, but often acts on marine life in concert with other stressors. Deltamethrin is one of the most widely used pyrethroid insecticides in the world because of its high activity and photostability to pests. Pyrethroid pesticides have little potential to pollute the environment, but they can enter organisms through the food chain and produce toxicity to aquatic organisms. Previously, pyrethroid residues of 6.36μg/L and 16.2μg/L were detected in coastal areas of Fujian and Zhejiang, respectively. At present, studies on deltamethrin toxicity to aquatic organisms mainly focus on acute and subacute toxicity tests of fish and shrimp, but few studies on shellfish. In order to investigate the toxic effects of seawater acidification and deltamethrin (DM) combined exposure on juvenile of Haliotis discus hannai, three pH values (pH 8.1, pH 7.7 and pH 7.4) and three deltamethrin concentrations (0, 0.6 and 6.0 μg/L) were used to stress juvenile of H. discus hannai. The microstructures and hardness of the shlls, the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the expression levels of genes related to stress and apoptosis in the tissues of juvenile of H. discus hannai were detected. The results showed that after the combined exposure of seawater acidification and deltamethrin for 31 days, the CaCO3 crystal deposition of juvenile abalone shells was difficult, the aragonite became smaller and formed scattered lamellar stacking, the pores between the aragonite increased, and the hardness of the shells decreased significantly. Meanwhile, seawater acidification and deltamethrin could change the activity of antioxidant enzymes in juvenile abalone. When the pH of seawater was 7.7 and 7.4 or the concentration of deltamethrin was 0.6 and 6, the SOD activity of juvenile abalone was lower than that of the control group, and the SOD activity of juvenile abalone under the combined exposure of seawater acidification and deltamethrin was significantly lower than that of single exposure, indicating that there was an obvious interaction between seawater acidification and deltamethrin on the SOD activity of juvenile abalone. However, deltamethrin significantly increased the activities of CAT and GST in juvenile abalone under the same pH exposure. In addition, this study also observed that the expression levels of stress genes and apoptotic genes in the tissues of juvenile abalone were increased with the increase of pCO2 and deltamethrin concentration, and there was a significant synergistic effect between seawater acidification and deltamethrin exposure on the expression levels of HSP70, HSP90, Caspase-3 and FADD. In conclusion, seawater acidification and deltamethrin exposure can produce significant toxic effects on juvenile abalone and play a certain interactive role in the reaction of tissue oxidative stress and cell apoptosis in juvenile abalone. © 2022 Shanghai Ocean University.

The hybrid abalone (Haliotis discus hannai ♀ × H. fulgens ♂, DF) and backcrosses are cultured on a large scale due to their high survival rates under heat stress in summer. The thermal resistance of purebreds, hybrid F1 and backcross populations were evaluated through Arrhenius break temperature (ABT) of cardiac performance in this study. The results showed that the hybrid F1 had the best thermal resistance, and the ABT gradually decreased with the increase in recurring number. In addition, a growth experiment of DD × DF (H. discus hannai ♀ × DF ♂) populations showed that DD × DF-Y (presence of black spots in the visceral mass of DD × DF) grew faster than DD × DF-N (absence of spots in the visceral mass of DD × DF) (p < 0.05), but the ABT of DD × DF-Y was lower than that of DD × DF-N (p < 0.05). The results suggest that the presence or absence of black spots in the visceral mass could be used as a breeding trait for the thermal resistance and growth of backcross abalone.

The low molecular weight (<5 kDa) peptides (LMW-AV) obtained from gastrointestinal digestion of AV could suppress allergenic responses on activated HMC-1 human mast cells in our previous study. Regarding the allergenic response of LMW-AV, in the present study, we further investigated the potential of oral administration of LMW-AV against atopic dermatitis (AD) in a dermatitis-induced model stimulated with Dermatophagoides farinae. The results demonstrated that the LMW-AV reduced a number of clinical symptoms, such as the severity of the dermatitis and serum immunoglobulin E levels. Moreover, LMW-AV could inhibit the expression of chemokines and cytokines. The histological analysis indicated that the LMW-AV has suppressed the eosinophil count and the mast cell infiltration into the upper dermis. The results suggest that LMW-AV can be considered as a promising candidate for AD treatment. © 2021 by the authors.

B2Z047,2022,Marine Drugs,20,4,,,254,"Alginate is the main component of brown algae, which is an important primary production in marine ecosystems and represents a huge marine biomass. The efficient utilization of alginate depends on alginate lyases to catalyze the degradation, and remains to be further explored. In this study, 354 strains were isolated from the gut of adult abalones, which mainly feed on brown algae. Among them, 100 alginate-degrading strains were gained and the majority belonged to the Gammaproteobacteria, followed by the Bacteroidetes and Alphaproteobacteria. A marine bacterium, Agarivorans sp. B2Z047, had the strongest degradation ability of alginate with the largest degradation circle and the highest enzyme activity. The optimal alginate lyase production medium of strain B2Z047 was determined as 1.1% sodium alginate, 0.3% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, and 0.1% MgSO4 in artificial seawater (pH 7.0). Cells of strain B2Z047 were Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, motile by flagella, short rod-shaped, and approximately 0.7–0.9 µm width and 1.2–1.9 µm length. The optimal growth conditions were determined to be at 30◦C, pH 7.0–8.0, and in 3% (w/v) NaCl. A total of 12 potential alginate lyase genes were identified through whole genome sequencing and prediction, which belonged to polysaccharide lyase family 6, 7, 17, and 38 (PL6, PL7, PL17, and PL38, respectively). Furthermore, the degradation products of nine alginate lyases were detected, among which Aly38A was the first alginate lyase belonging to the PL38 family that has been found to degrade alginate. The combination of alginate lyases functioning in the alginate-degrading process was further demonstrated by the growth curve and alginate lyase production of strain B2Z047 cultivated with or without sodium alginate, as well as the content changes of total sugar and reducing sugar and the transcript levels of alginate lyase genes. A simplified model was proposed to explain the alginate utilization process of Agarivorans sp. B2Z047. © 2022 by the authors.

Chauvaud P.; Day R.; Roussel S.,No evident effect of domestication on the anti-predator behaviour of European abalone (Haliotis tuberculata): Implications for stock enhancement programs,2021,Applied Animal Behaviour Science,244,,,,105470,"Stock-enhancement programs for the European abalone (Haliotis tuberculata) might be an efficient way to restore collapsed natural populations or preserve fishing activities. Specifically, this practice consists of releasing hatchery-reared juveniles from wild or farmed broodstock into natural environments. However, the process of selection and adaptation to farming conditions may result in domestication, thus leading to genetic and behavioural changes in farmed animals. Therefore, evaluating the effects of the domestication process on juveniles is a critical first step toward the development of successful abalone stock-enhancement programs. To this end, the behaviour and survival of sixteen-month-old H. tuberculata juveniles from wild and from farmed broodstock (the product of three generations of shell-length based selection) were compared. We used three assays at different spatial and temporal scales: (1) short-term responses to simulated contact with predators, (2) the activity pattern in the presence of a natural predator (the velvet crab Necora puber) in aquariums during a 2-week trial, and (3) survival in large mesocosms in the presence of predators during a 3-week trial. No significant effects of the broodstock origin of the juveniles were detected on any of the studied parameters (P > 0.05). In addition, the estimated size effects were small compared to the overall mean for most of the variables, suggesting that the domestication process was too recent to induce important behavioural changes in juveniles from farmed broodstock. Introducing crabs into the mesocosms significantly decreased abalone survival rates (P < 0.05). In the activity pattern trial, most of the abalone mortality in aquariums with crabs (55%) occurred within the first three days, which was largely attributed to initial exploration of areas outside of shelters by the abalone. In the second week, abalone spent much less time moving when crabs were present (P < 0.05). These results suggest that juveniles from both origins would likely have the same survival rates if released in the wild. The commonly reported high abalone mortality immediately after seeding is likely due to a lack of hiding behaviour or exploration of the new environment during the first few days of exposure to predators in the wild. Therefore, current release systems may need to be adjusted to the ethological characteristics of abalone juveniles to avoid high mortalities due to an initial lack of predator avoidance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.applanim.2021.105470,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116932625

Five isonitrogenous and isolipidic experimental diets with graded levels of FM replaced by CAP (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100%, respectively) were fed to abalone (initial weight: 21.83 ± 0.25 g) for 110 days. The five diets were named as CAP0, CAP25, CAP50, CAP75 and CAP100, respectively. The results showed that total replacement of dietary FM by CAP did not significantly affect the growth of abalone compared with the control. The highest weight gain rate was observed in the CAP25 group. Compared to the CAP0 group, the CAP25 group also had significantly higher total essential amino acids content in muscle and trypsin activity in digestive gland. The expressions of mammalian target of rapamycin, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and threonine kinase/protein B were significantly upregulated, and the expression of AMP-activated protein kinase α2 was significantly downregulated in the muscle of abalone in the CAP25 and CAP50 groups. The crude protein content, hardness, hydroxyproline content, pH value, pyridinium crosslink content, activities of lysyl hydroxylase and prolyl 4-hydroxylase in muscle were significantly elevated in the CAP25 and CAP50 groups. Considering the growth performance, digestion, mTOR pathways and muscle quality, 25% replacement of dietary FM by CAP (4.1% of dietary CAP inclusion level) was recommended for abalone. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738070,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125621262

This study investigated the effects of OA on adults of two abalone species (Haliotis diversicolor, a subtropical species, and Haliotis discus hannai, a temperate species). Abalone were exposed to three pCO2 conditions for 1 year (ambient, ~ 880, and ~ 1600 μatm), and parameters, including mortality, physiology, immune system, biochemistry, and carry-over effects, were measured. Survival decreased significantly at ~ 800 μatm pCO2 for H. diversicolor, while H. discus hannai survival was negatively affected only at a higher OA level (~ 1600 μatm pCO2). H. diversicolor exhibited depressed metabolic and excretion rates and a higher O:N ratio under OA, indicating a shift to lipids as a metabolism substrate, while these physiological parameters in H. discus hannai were robust to OA. Both abalone failed to compensate for the pH decrease of their internal fluids because of the lowered hemolymph pH under OA. However, the reduced hemolymph pH did not affect total hemocyte counts or tested biomarkers. Additionally, H. discus hannai increased its hemolymph protein content under OA, which could indicate enhanced immunity. Larvae produced by adults exposed to the three pCO2 levels were cultured in the same pCO2 conditions and larval deformation and shell length were measured to observe carry-over effects. Enhanced OA tolerance was observed for H. discus hannai exposed under both of the OA treatments, while that was only observed following parental pCO2 ~ 880 μatm exposure for H. diversicolor. Following pCO2 ~ 1600 μatm parental exposure, H. diversicolor offspring exhibited higher deformation and lower shell growth in all pCO2 treatments. In general, H. diversicolor were more susceptible to OA compared with H. discus hannai, suggesting that H. diversicolor could be unable to adapt to acidified oceans in the future. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158144,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137065267

Plaque titration revealed that these crude polysaccharides efficiently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation with IC50 values ranging from 0.35 to 4.37 µg/mL. The crude polysaccharide of H. fusiforme showed the strongest antiviral effect, with IC50 of 0.35 µg/mL, followed by S. horneri and abalone viscera with IC50 of 0.56 and 4.37 µg/mL, respectively. In addition, immunofluorescence assay, western blot, and quantitative RT-PCR analysis verified that these polysaccharides could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. In Vero E6 cells, treatment with these crude polysaccharides before or after viral infection strongly inhibited the expression level of SARS-CoV-2 spikes, nucleocapsid proteins, and RNA copies of RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase and nucleocapsid.

The treatments PEF (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 kV cm−1) and cooking (CO) were applied at 100°C × 15 min. Then, their performances were subjected to a FD process. PEF + CO pretreated freeze-dried samples showed shorter process times than freeze-dried control samples without PEF + CO, where the treatment PEF at 2.0 kV cm−1 reached the shortest time. In addition, the abovementioned samples presented the best textural parameters but a low protein content. The thermal properties indicate a total denaturation of the proteins, where the amide I region presented greater mobility in the sample pretreated with an electric field of 2.0 kV cm−1. The assay for digestibility shows better hydrolysis for the 2.0 kV cm−1 PEF sample and has a higher Computer-Protein Efficiency Ratio (C-PER). Thereby, variations in thermal behavior and physicochemical parameters in comparison to combined PEF + CO pretreatments were observed. In addition, high protein quality and digestibility of pretreated freeze-dried Chilean abalones were maintained to the desired properties (texture and C-PER) and conditions (FD time).

Five isonitrogenous (about 29% of crude protein) and isolipidic (about 4% of crude lipid) experimental diets with graded levels of fish meal replaced by SBM (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100%, respectively) were fed to abalone (initial body weight: 21.87 ± 0.07 g, initial shell length: 53.18 ± 0.18 mm) for 16 weeks. These experimental diets were named as SBM0, SBM25, SBM50, SBM75 and SBM100, respectively. The results showed that: 1) There was no significant difference in survival of abalone among all the treatments. The highest weight gain rate was found in the SBM50 group, and the group did not significantly differ from those in the SBM75 and SBM100 groups. 2) Replacement of fish meal by SBM linearly and quadratically increased the crude lipid content in muscle of abalone, which reached its highest level in the SBM50 group. 3) Trypsin activity in the digestive gland of abalone fed SBM25 diet was significantly higher than that of other groups. 4) The highest total anti-oxidative capacity and superoxidase activity in digestive gland were found in the SBM50 group. 5) The highest mRNA levels of pi3k and eif-4e, and the lowest level of 4e-bp in muscle were found in the SBM50 group. There was no significant difference in the mRNA level of mtor in the muscle among all the groups. 6). The lowest expression level of nf-κb and the highest expression level of mytimacin 6 in digestive gland of abalone were observed fed SBM50 diet. A significant quadratic trend was found in the mRNA levels of il-16 with increasing levels of dietary SBM. Meanwhile, the mRNA level of β-defensin was linearly decreased after total replacement of fish meal by SBM.

In this study, after four months of culturing under blue light (NB), orange light (NY), dark environment (ND), and natural light (NN), the shell length and weight-specific growth rate in Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai, were ranked in the following order: NY > NN > ND > NB. To understand the growth differences in abalone under these different light environments, we first performed 24-h video monitoring and found that the cumulative movement distance and duration were lowest in group NB, whereas the cumulative movement distance and duration were significantly higher in group ND than in any other group (P < 0.05). In group NB, the time spent hidden underneath the attachment substrate accounted for 81% of the resting time, but this ratio was lowest in group ND, at only 37% (P < 0.05). Next, LC-MS metabolomics identified 201 and 105 metabolites in NB vs. NN, ND vs. NN, and NY vs. NN under the positive and negative ion modes, respectively. According to the fold changes and annotations for differential metabolites in the KEGG enrichment pathways, adenosine, NAD+, cGMP, and arachidonic acid were used as differential metabolism markers, and the AMPK signaling pathway was enriched in every comparison group, and thus investigated further. The gene sequences of three subtypes of AMPK were obtained by cloning and we found that the expression levels of AMPKα and AMPKγ, and the AMP content were significantly higher in group NB than in any other group (P < 0.05). In addition, the ATP contents and adenylate energy charge values were ranked in the following order: NY > NN > ND > NB. According to in situ hybridization analysis, the three subtype genes were widely expressed in the hepatopancreas. Finally, the contents of many lipid metabolites differed significantly among groups and the expression levels of the triglyceride hydrolysis-related gene hormone sensitive lipase and fatty acid oxidation-related gene carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 were higher in groups ND and NB than in groups NN and NY according to fluorescence quantification PCR (P < 0.05). The expression levels of fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase were significantly lower in groups ND and NB than in groups NN and NY (P < 0.05). These findings indicated that differences in the spectral composition of incident light could reshape the behavior and physiological metabolism in abalone by influencing the “energy switch” AMPK, thereby providing some insights into the mechanisms that allow nocturnal marine organisms to adapt to different lighting environments. © 2022 The Authors",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113873,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134327704

This area is characterized by the presence of numerous human activities, which could harm the quality of seawater. Additionally, the presence of potentially pathogenic microorganisms can influence the health status of mussels, which must be constantly monitored. To have a clear viewpoint of the health status of M. chilensis and to study its potential as a host species for exotic diseases, microbiological, molecular, and histological analyses were performed. This study was carried out in October 2018, where M. chilensis gut were studied for: presence of food-borne bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp.), exotic bacteria (“Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis”), viruses (abalone and Ostreid herpes virus), and protozoa (Marteilia spp., Perkinsus spp. and Bonamia spp.). Additionally, 18S rDNA metabarcoding and histology analyses were included to have a complete evaluation of the health status of M. chilensis. Overall, despite the presence of risk factors, abnormal mortality rates were not reported during the monitoring period and the histological examination did not reveal significant lesions. Pathogens of mandatory notification to World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the Chilean National Fisheries and Aquaculture Service (SERNAPESCA) were not detected, which confirms that M. chilensis have a good health status, highlighting the importance of an integrated vision of different disciplines to ensure the sustainability of this important mussel industry in Chile. © 2022 by the authors.

A series of on-site experiments was conducted to identify the optimal cultivation conditions for this new model. The effects of different stocking densities and diets on the survival rate and growth rate were examined. Abalones were placed in four stocking densities (20, 30, 40, and 50% coverage of available surface area of the culture cage) in this platform, and a control group with one density was set in the traditional aquaculture system. In addition, the effects of different diets (formulated diet, dried Laminaria japonica, and fresh Gracilaria lemaneiformis) for abalone were also studied. Over 240 days, reductions of the survival rate and growth rate of shell length and body weight were observed with the increase of the stocking density. Although the abalone were fed adequate food, the growth rate was limited by the stocking density. Condition index increased with the culture time but decreased with the increase of the stocking density. The growth rates of the shell length and body weight in the formulated diet group were significantly higher than the other two diets. The results also indicated that the medium and large-sized abalone may be more suitable for the new platform, as the medium and large-sized abalone had a higher growth rate when culturing on the mechanized platform, whereas small abalone grew faster on the traditional model. The results from this study can provide fundamental data supporting the offshore mechanized farming of abalone, which will not only promote the yield and reduce the stress of coastal aquaculture environments, but also will contribute to the transformation and upgrading of the abalone farming industry. © 2021",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737769,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120424714

Abalone aquaculture has experienced such losses, and thus, thermal-tolerant species are needed for mechanistic research and selective breeding programs. Hence, suitable methods to evaluate the thermal tolerance of abalone have become vitally important. In this study, a high-throughput evaluation method (heat adhesion duration, HAD) was developed based on the adhesion capacity of abalone. The stability and accuracy of the new method were verified by comparisons of survival time, Arrhenius breakpoint temperatures (ABT) of cardiac performance, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Positive correlations were found between HAD and survival time and between HAD and ABT, indicating that individuals with higher HAD were more thermal tolerant. The HAD values increased with acclimation temperature (20 °C, 24 °C) but were not affected by abalone size, age, or sex. The assessments of HAD, ABT, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated stronger thermal tolerance of the southern population (JJ) of Haliotis discus hannai compared to the northern population (DL), suggesting plasticity of abalone in thermal tolerance. In addition, the thermal resistance of five abalone species from two hybridization systems, H. discus hannai (DD), H. gigantea (GG), H. fulgens (FF), hybrid H. gigantea ♀ × H. discus hannai ♂ (GD), and hybrid H. discus hannai ♀ × H. fulgens ♂ (DF), was evaluated by HAD and ABT, confirming the existence of heterosis for thermal tolerance. The high-throughput method developed in this study could provide a reliable indicator for molecular mechanism analyses and genetic selection for thermal tolerance in abalone. © 2021",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737226,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111044261

Fusarium verticillioides is one of the most dominant toxigenic fungal species, associated with fumonisin contamination in grain-based feeds, such as compound abalone feed. Mycotoxin production is influenced by temperature and available nutrients. In this study the aims were: to determine if abalone feed as growth substrate favours mycotoxin production for toxigenic fungi; to determine the most effective temperature for fumonisin production by F. verticillioides on abalone feed; and to assess the effect of the aquatic environment on fumonisin-contaminated abalone feed. A total of 93 fungal isolates were inoculated onto abalone feed, including species belonging to the genera Fusarium, Aspergillus and Penicillium. Feed inoculated with F. verticillioides were incubated at two different temperatures and fumonisin-contaminated feed was submerged into seawater for 24 h. Results showed that mycotoxins were produced when abalone feed was inoculated with toxigenic fungi, and that F. verticillioides produced higher concentrations of fumonisins at a lower temperature. Submerging fumonisin-contaminated feed in seawater showed that this toxin leached into the seawater, lowering the risk of fumonisins to be consumed by abalone. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Anti-Freeze Proteins (AFPs) have been acknowledged to have positive effects on the survival of oocytes, embryos and ovaries during cryopreservation. AFPs drop the freezing point beneath the balance point of melting by binding ice crystals; restricting their expansion and recrystallization. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of AFP I and III separately or in combination on the vitrification and warming procedures of ovarian tissues which were vitrified for one week and one month. Ovaries were obtained from rats and randomly assigned to four groups according to the AFP supplements in the media used during freeze/warm procedures: 1) control group (medium without AFP); 2) AFP I; 3) AFP III; 4) AFP I + AFP III groups. The groups were further organized according to the duration of vitrification, 1 week or 1 month. Ovaries were evaluated morphologically by a grading system, TUNEL assay and by transmission electron microscopy. AFP supplementation decreased apoptosis and follicular damage. Supplementation of AFP type I and type III has cryoprotective roles in ovaries which were vitrified for 1 week and 1 month. Additionally, AFP I+AFP III supplementation were shown to have more protection in long term. © 2021, Veteriner Fakultesi Dergisi.

Agardh, known in some regions as ‘giant kelp’, occurs along temperate coastal rocky reefs throughout the southern hemisphere, as well as along the north-east Pacific coastline. In Chile, it serves as a major source of abalone feed within the abalone industry, with considerable literature on cultivation of the species. Here we attempt to cultivate South African M. pyrifera through vegetative propagation and investigate its use as a feed for the abalone, Haliotis midae. Kelp holdfasts were attached to a rope-raft system in Saldanha Bay, South Africa, and monitored over 3 months. In addition, a 6-month H. midae feed inclusion trial was carried out, which compared the use of M. pyrifera with the predominant commercial kelp feed species, Ecklonia maxima. Young M. pyrifera grew well on the culture system, with mean upright length nearly doubling over the culture period (55.6–102.2 cm) and displayed mean upright relative growth rates between 0.99 and 1.22% day-1. Additionally, holdfasts developed new uprights and holdfasts increased in size, growing around culture lines. Simulated partial harvesting of samples stopped upright elongation, but samples survived, whereas complete removal of uprights caused mortality. Haliotis midae fed with M. pyrifera + formulated feed (SAF 3000®) displayed comparable growth rates to the E. maxima + SAF 3000® diet. No significant differences in mean specific growth rate (M. pyrifera 0.19, E. maxima 0.18% body weight day-1), daily increment in shell length (M. pyrifera 31.19, E. maxima 24.64 μm day-1), condition factor (M. pyrifera 1.37, E. maxima 1.40 g mm-1) and mortality rate were identified between the two diets. Additionally, H. midae consumed significantly less M. pyrifera than E. maxima, suggesting potential differences in feed conversion ratio/kelp nutritional composition among the kelp species. These findings provide baseline information for the potential cultivation and use of M. pyrifera as a new source of fresh seaweed feed in the South African abalone industry. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10811-021-02389-0,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101032352

It is vital in aquaculture by bringing beneficial traits into hybrids. People have utilized the heterosis theory in aquaculture for years. However, the molecular basis of heterosis remains elusive. Evident growth and survival heterosis were shown in the hybrid (“Dongyou-1”) of two Haliotis diversicolor geographic genotypes (Japan and Taiwan). To explore the molecular basis underlying the hybrid abalone’s heterosis, we conducted comparative mRNA and miRNA transcriptional analysis in the hybrid and parental genotypes. Differentially expression analysis identified 5,562 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 102 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) between the three genotypes. 1,789 DEGs and 71 DEMs were found to be non-additively expressed in the hybrid. Meanwhile, both the expression level dominance pattern (ELD) and expression level overdominance pattern (ELOD) were found in the DEGs and DEMs, showing the existence of dominance and overdominance models in the hybrid’s transcriptome and post-transcriptional regulation. Functional analysis showed the non-additively expressed genes, ELD genes, and ELOD genes were significantly enriched in growth, immunity, and stress response related pathways, while some of the pathways were regulated by the mRNA-miRNA interactions. The expression levels of FGF, C1Q, HC, CAT, SEGPX, and MGST were significantly up-regulated in the hybrid compared to the middle parent value. In conclusion, we identified the existence of non-additivity, dominance, and overdominance models in the transcriptome and miRNAome of the H. diversicolor hybrid; these models facilitate the advantageous parental alleles’ integration into the hybrid, contributing to the hybrid’s growth and survival heterosis. © Copyright © 2021 Liang, You, Luo, Ke, Huang, Guo and Ke.",10.3389/fmars.2021.667636,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85108161722

These abalone are harvested excessively and consequently, these animals do not have a chance to replace themselves, ensuing in a drastic decrease in natural abalone stocks. Abalone, has an extremely slow growth rate, and takes approximately four years to reach a size that is marketable. Probiotics offer a viable treatment solution to improve the growth, health and vigour of these animals. Two microorganisms, a yeast isolate Debaryomyces hansenii and a bacterial isolate Vibrio midae, from the gut of the South African abalone were characterised for their probiotic abilities. This work resulted in an internationally competitive concept technology that was patented. Thereafter research was focussed on developing a suitable bioprocess to enable commercial production of one the isolates, V. midae. During this development, production parameters such as temperature and pH, as well as alternative medium additives, such as the use of corn steep liquor (CSL) and high test molasses (HTM) was assessed. Once a high efficiency production process was developed at laboratory scale, this up- and downstream production technology was scaled up to manufacturing scale, which resulted in a final market ready probiotic product. The optimization of the key variables resulted in a 180% increase in cell concentration and a 5716-fold increase in cell productivity, in comparison to conventional growth conditions and parameters used at the beginning of the study. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.bcab.2020.101794,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092001886

Four artificial diets were designed with 0 (artificial diet control), 7.5, 15.0 and 22.5 mg/kg of APSH-07, respectively. The brown alga Laminaria japonica was used as the live food control. Results showed that the specific growth rates of abalone in the groups with 7.5 and 15.0 mg/kg dietary APSH-07 were significantly higher than those in the controls (p '.05). The total haemocyte counts and respiratory burst activity in haemolymph of abalone in the group with 7.5 mg/kg of dietary APSH-07 were significantly higher than those in the groups with 0 and 22.5 mg/kg of dietary APSH-07 (p '.05). The gene expression levels of Mn-superoxide dismutase and thioredoxin peroxidase 2, and the activities of glutathione peroxidase in the group with 7.5 mg/kg of dietary APSH-07 were significantly higher than those in the other groups (p '.05). Cumulative mortality of abalone after the challenge test was significantly decreased in the group with 7.5 mg/kg of dietary APSH-07 supplementation. Supplementation of 22.5 mg/kg dietary APSH-07 significantly increased the cumulative mortality. In conclusion, 7.5 mg/kg of dietary APSH-07 supplementation had the better growth performance, higher antioxidation, immune and disease resistance capacity of abalone. Excessive supplementation of dietary antimicrobial peptide APSH-07 (22.5 mg/kg) had significantly negative effects. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal level of dietary APSH-07 supplementation for abalone. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/anu.13124,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089888800

A total of 1,080 abalone were distributed into 18 net cages. Five formulated diets were prepared in triplicate. The CPB0 diet contained 200 g/kg U. pinnatifida. The 250, 500, 750 and 1,000 g/kg U. pinnatifida were substituted with the equal amount of CPB, referred to as the CPB250, CPB500, CPB750 and CPB1000 diets, respectively. Finally, dry U. pinnatifida was prepared. Abalone were fed for 16 weeks and then subjected to air exposure stressor for 24 hr. The cumulative mortality of abalone was monitored for the following 4 days after 24-hr air exposure. Survival, weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone fed all formulated diets were greater than those of abalone fed the U. pinnatifida. The greatest weight gain and SGR were achieved in abalone fed the CPB500 diet. The chemical composition of the soft body of abalone was not affected by the experimental diets. Higher cumulative mortality was observed in abalone fed the CPB0 and dry U. pinnatifida at 16 hr after 24-hr air exposure compared to abalone fed all other diets.

Liu W.; Zhao Y.; Shi Z.; Li Z.; Liang X.,Ecotoxicoproteomic assessment of microplastics and plastic additives in aquatic organisms: A review,2020,Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology - Part D: Genomics and Proteomics,36,,,,100713,"Advances in proteomics have greatly improved chemical toxicity assessment and predictions of adverse outcomes in organisms. Ecotoxicoproteomics has been employed to elucidate biological pathways affected by chemicals and provide data that can be incorporated into adverse outcome pathways (AOP) to better define the ecological risk of emerging pollutants. Microplastics (MPs) and plastic additives have raised global concern due to their widespread use in aquatic environments, bioaccumulation in tissues, and toxic effects in aquatic organisms. Despite showing sublethal toxicity in many cases, mechanisms underlying these emerging pollutants are underexplored. In this review, adverse effects and recent ecotoxicoproteomic studies of MPs and typical additives (i.e. plasticizers, flame retardants, antioxidants, and UV stabilizers) in aquatic organisms are summarized. Proteomics data show that MPs adversely affect ingestion and reproduction via disrupting pathways related to energy metabolism, stress-related defense, and cytoskeletal dynamics. Biological processes including lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis, skeletal development, neurotransmitter signaling, and immune response are modulated by additives and induce developmental malformations in fish embryos/larvae. Furthermore, plastic additives also exert reproductive toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and neurotoxicity in invertebrates (e.g. mussel, abalone, and oyster) and fish by disrupting detoxification/oxidative stress, hormonal modulation, signal transduction, and apoptosis. Additional studies are needed to complement the omic knowledge of chemical additives that are not well documented (e.g. UV stabilizers) for improving understanding into toxic mechanisms and for characterizing ecological risk linked to plastic contaminants. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.cbd.2020.100713,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092612335

However, the relative long-term effects of hypoxia on bivalves, including abalone, are not well understood. In this study, we examined the effects of exposure to hypoxic (2.5 and 4 mg O2 L−1) and normoxic (8 mg O2 L−1) conditions on the growth, survival, and immune and antioxidant responses of the economically important Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai over a 4 month period. We observed that exposure to 2.5 mg O2 L−1 resulted in marked reductions in assessed shell parameters, average meat weight, and survival compared with exposure to 4 and 8 mg O2 L–1. There were also significant reductions in oxygen consumption and ammonia-N excretion in abalone exposed to 2.5 mg O2 L−1. We also detected initial immunosuppression in the 2.5 mg O2 L−1-treated abalone, as evidenced by a significant reduction in total hemocytes and inhibition of antibacterial and lysozyme activities. Furthermore, intracellular malondialdehyde concentrations were significantly elevated at 1 month in the 2.5 mg O2 L−1 treatment group, whereas there were reductions in the levels of glutathione and enzymatic activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase, thereby indicating potential hypoxia-induced oxidative stress and a depression of antioxidant capacity. After 4 months of treatment, severe hypoxia (2.5 mg O2 L−1) had significantly modulated all measured parameters, whereas exposure to 4 and 8 mg O2 L−1 had induced no significant effects. Collectively, our observations indicate that under long-term exposure to hypoxia, Pacific abalone failed to maintain an effective antioxidant defense system and adequate immunity, with the observed biochemical disruptions leading to a reduction in growth and survival. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105596,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089502565

Samples of abalone were collected both in autumn and winter in Flinders Bay, Augusta, Western Australia, and land transported for 6 (six) hours. Several immunological parameters were assessed, including survival rate, total haemocyte count, osmoregulatory capacity, phagocytic rate, lactate level, and glucose level. The results indicated that the abalone samples collected in the two seasons showed different physiological responses; the winter samples were more responsive to transportation than the autumn samples. Transportation stress significantly increased total haemocyte count and osmoregulatory capacity of the winter samples, suggesting an immune stimulation. This stress also triggered an immune suppression, causing the phagocytic rate and lysosomal stability to significantly decrease after transportation. Lactate levels in the winter samples decreased significantly after transportation, possibly indicating the transition from a stressed to normal state, during the period of recovery. The constant level of glucose before and after transportation in both seasons showed that it was the least sensitive indicator used in this study. In general, there was no difference in the immune modulation parameters between wild and ranched abalone in either of the seasons sampled. However, in the autumn samples, there were significant differences (P<0.05) in haemocyte count and osmoregulatory capacity of the wild and ranched samples collected from all sites. These differences did not form a consistent indicator trend between the sites from the two sample sources. Therefore, the results do not raise any immediate concern that ranched abalone were differently stressed to those from the wild. The results in present study could serve as useful data in developing the live transportation method of greenlip abalone. © 2020, Indonesian Aquaculture Journal.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087171094

H. discus hannai (shell length: 32.75 ± 2.63 mm, body weight: 4.91 ± 0.34 g) was selected to perform a 70 d laboratory culture experiment including a 14 d V. parahaemolyticus artificial infection experiment. The control group (C) was fed normal commercial feed every day. The M1 experimental group was given experimental feed and basal feed on alternating days until the end of the experiment. The M2 experimental group was given experimental feed for 4 d and basal feed for 3 d, and this cycle was repeated every 7 d until the end of the experiment. The M3 experimental group was given experimental feed for 2 d and basal feed for 5 d, and this cycle was repeated every 7 d until the end of the experiment. The M4 group was continuously given experimental feed for the duration of the experiment. The concentration of added B. lincheniformis in each experimental group was 105 cfu/g (according to the quantity of viable bacteria). The specific growth rate (as measured by body weight) and the feed conversion efficiency of the abalone in M1 and M2 were significantly higher than those in M4 and C (P < 0.05). The cellulose and lipase activities of abalone in M1, M2 or M4 were significantly higher than those in M3 or C (P < 0.05). The acid phosphatase, superoxide dismutase, total haemocyte counts, O2 − levels generated by respiratory bursts, and the expression levels of Mn-SOD, TPx, GSTs and GSTm in abalone in the M2 group were significantly higher than those in any other feeding frequency group (P < 0.05). At the end of the V. parahaemolyticus infection, the cumulative mortality of the abalone in M2 was significantly lower than that in any other group (P < 0.05). Consequently, given the growth advantages and the enhancement of immune function, the feeding plan in which B. lincheniformis was applied for 4 d per week, and basal feed was then applied for 3 d, did not lead to a high level of immune reaction, immune fatigue or waste of resources, but increased the growth rate of individuals and their resistance to V. parahaemolyticus infection. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.fsi.2019.11.038,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076217707

Marine biota selected from various trophic levels were collected in Korean coastal waters throughout 2014 and 2015 and their plutonium levels were measured to evaluate the radioactive contamination levels in the marine organisms that constitute the primary seafood diet in the Republic of Korea (ROK). The results showed that the activity concentrations of 239,240Pu in plankton, macroalgae, mollusks, crustaceans, and cephalopods ranged from 13 to 58, 0.64 to 0.80, 0.94 to 5.40, 0.06 to 0.50, and 0.26 mBq kg−1 of wet weight (w.w.), respectively. The activity concentrations of 239,240Pu measured in the muscles of fish varied from 0.09 to 0.30 mBq kg−1 (w.w.), relatively low values compared to those in other groups regardless of fish species, size, and sampling area. The concentration characteristics of 239,240Pu in the various organs in the respective marine products revealed that the internal organs showed higher concentrations than the muscle or skin (or exoskeleton). The highest concentration of 239,240Pu was measured in the viscera of an abalone, which had an activity concentration of 6.31 mBq kg−1 (w.w.). The concentration factors (CFs) in the >300-μm fraction of plankton and in anchovy, shrimp, and mackerel ranged 67–84% of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)-recommended values, although the CF in macroalgae was much lower at approximately 5% of IAEA values, suggesting a wide range of 239,240Pu CF in macroalgae. The mean transfer factor (TF) between macroalgae (0.6–0.8 mBq kg−1) and abalone (5.4 mBq kg−1) was estimated to be 7.5, implying that effective Pu transfer occurred between the two species. These figures equate to annual effective doses of 239,240Pu to Koreans through consumption of macroalgae, shellfish, and fish of 1.8 × 10−6, 1.4 × 10−6, and 7.1 × 10−7 mSv yr−1, respectively, and a total dose of 3.9 × 10−6 mSv yr−1, values that are negligible compared to the annual effective dose limit of 1 mSv yr−1. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jenvrad.2020.106191,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079556368
Araújo S.; Azenha S.R.; Henriques I.; Tacão M.,qnrA gene diversity in Shewanella spp,2021,Microbiology (United Kingdom),167,12,,,1118,"Members of Shewanella are ubiquitous in aquatic environments, some of which have been implicated in human infections. The progenitors of antibiotic resistance genes with clinical relevance, such as qnrA genes, have been identified in Shewanella. qnrA code for a pentapeptide repeat protein that protects type II topoisomerases, decreasing susceptibility to quinolones and fluoroquinolones. In this study, 248 genomes of 49 Shewanella species were analysed as well as 33 environmental isolates belonging to 10 Shewanella species. The presence of the qnrA gene was detected in 22.9% of the genomes and 15.2% of the isolates. The gene was more often detected in Shewanella algae, but was also detected in Shewanella carassii, Shewanella chilikensis, Shewanella haliotis and Shewanella indica. The identified genes encoded the previously described variants QnrA3 (in 22 genomes of one species), QnrA2 (eight genomes and three species), QnrA1 (six genomes and two species), QnrA7 (five genomes and two species), QnrA10 (two genomes of one species) and QnrA4 (one genome). In addition, 11 novel variants with 3 to 7 amino acid substitutions were identified (in 13 genomes and one environmental isolate). The presence of this gene appears to be species-specific although within some species several variants were detected. The study presents a previously unknown diversity of qnrA in Shewanella, highlighting the role of this genus as progenitor and reservoir of these genes. Further studies are needed to determine the phenotypes conferred by the new variants and the mechanisms that may mediate the transfer of these genes to new hosts. © 2021 The Authors.",10.1099/mic.0.001118,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122846149
Jwa M.-S.; Hong C.-Y.,Prospecting the effects on abalone (H. discus) growth under low-salinity stress after feeding citrus peel (cp) and ecklonia cava disuse (ecd) as feed additives,2021,Journal of Marine Science and Engineering,9,7,,,707,"This study addressed the effects of adding citrus peel (CP) and Ecklonia cava disuse extract (ECD) in the diet of abalones, which are a highly utilized marine species in Korea. As interest in abalone farming is increasing around the fishing community, the installation of land tanks and fish farms on the southern coast and Jeju Island in South Korea is spreading remarkably. In order to create the best opportunities for survival and reproduction, immunity to disease, and growth potential of abalones, we must consider the diet implemented in abalone farming. The survival rate of abalone has shown positive results when their diet is supplemented with CP and ECD. Our research also concluded that the addition of ECD may have a significant effect on the abalone growth and physiology. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

To ensure the effectiveness of the probiotic bacterium Vibrio midae K811 in an aquaculture environment, we wished to investigate whether V. midae K811 reaches the abalone intestinal tract where it is expected to exert its probiotic effect. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the colonization potential of V. midae K811 and to localise the probiotic within the gastrointestinal tract of post-larval H. midae. The Tn9 cat gene incorporated in V. midae K811 was PCR amplified from total DNA isolated from whole abalone homogenates up to 10 days following the cessation of feeding abalone with the probiotic-supplemented diet, while viable V. midae K811 was detected in abalone homogenates up to 25 days after the post-larval abalone had been switched from an alginate surface supplemented with V. midae K811 to a surface supplemented with Cocconeis sp. Furthermore, in situ hybridization using two Tn9 cat gene-specific DIG-labelled oligonucleotide probes detected V. midae K811 in the intestine of post-larval H. midae, confirming that the probiotic reaches the digestive tract of post-larval abalone placed on an alginate biofilm supplemented with the probiotic, and that the bacterium can persist in the abalone digestive tract for a period of at least 3 weeks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735497,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085037030

Since then there have been considerable changes. There are three main uses of kelp (mostly Ecklonia maxima, with some Laminaria pallida) in South Africa. The collection of wash-up for drying and exporting for alginate extraction has drastically reduced to very small amounts in recent years. The boat harvest of fresh kelp for abalone feed in land-based farms has reached a plateau of between 4000 and 5000 t fresh per annum. The diver harvest of E. maxima for agricultural liquid plant growth enhancer shows a constant increase over several years, is still growing, and is currently over 3000 t fresh per annum. The small intertidal collection of Gelidium pristoides as export for agar production has maintained a small, sustainable production of around 100 t dry for many years. Former Gracilaria industries in sheltered bays in both South Africa and Namibia have collapsed, and there is currently no commercial collection. There was commercial raft aquaculture production of Gracilaria in Lüderitz Bay, Namibia for a number of years, but this is no longer practised. Currently, the only commercial seaweed use in Namibia is of L. pallida. Annually, ca. 150 t of fresh wash-up is collected, in Lüderitz, to be used as feed in land-based abalone aquaculture. There are a number of small start-up companies experimenting with seaweed products for cosmetics and nutritional products in both countries, some involving species of Ulva and Porphyra. The former species is a major aquaculture product, with around 2000 t fresh yr-1 being produced in integrated land-based systems with abalone. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.",10.1515/bot-2019-0074,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089099734
Jo M.J.; Kim S.J.; Go H.-J.; Park N.G.; Kim G.-D.,Anti‐adipogenic Effects of αAL14 Mediated by Modulation of PI3K/Akt Pathways in 3T3-L1 Cells,2021,International Journal of Peptide Research and Therapeutics,27,3,1913,1922,,"Abstract: A model peptide, αAL14, was designed from the primary structure of a novel antimicrobial peptide purified form the abalone. αAL14 was only reported for antimicrobial and anti-angiogenic effects. Therefore, in this study, we investigated anti-adipogenic effects of αAL14 on preadipocyte, 3T3-L1. Obesity is an imbalance in metabolism caused by excessive energy intake or reduced energy consumption, and fat accumulates in the body, which causes chronic disease such as high pressure, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Inhibition of adipogenesis has been focused on as a strategy for treating metabolic disease including diabetes and obesity. In order to confirm the effect on adipocyte differentiation, αAL14 was treated while inducing differentiation from preadipocytes into mature adipocytes. We observed that αAL14 potently and dose-dependently suppressed accumulation of lipid droplets during mature adipocyte differentiation. αAL14 also down-regulated the expression of key adipogenic regulator such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR γ), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBP α) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1). In addition, αAL14 diminished the insulin-stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling and its downstream factors that promote adipogenesis by inducing the expression of PPAR γ, such as mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) and forkhead box (Fox) transcription factors, which may reduce glucose uptake in response to insulin and lipid accumulation. These results indicated that αAL14 suppresses adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation depending on multiple mechanisms. In summary, αAL14 could be a novel inhibitor of adipogenesis and may have applications for the treatment of obesity.

However, how to develop aquatic animal resources deeply is a key point to be solved in the fishery industry. Over the past decades, numerous aquatic animals have gained great attention in the development and utilization of their bioactive molecules which are of therapeutic applications as nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals. Recent research revealed that aquatic animals are composed of many vital moieties, such as polysaccharides and proteins, which provide health benefits beyond basic nutrition. In particular, aquatic animal polysaccharides are gaining worldwide popularity owing to their high content, ease of extraction, specific structure, few side effects, prominent therapeutic potential and incorporation in functional foods and dietary supplements. Thus, tremendous research on the isolation, identification and bioactivities of polysaccharides has been carried out. This review presents comprehensive viewpoints on extraction, separation, purification, structural characterization and bioactivity of various polysaccharides from aquatic animals, such as sea cucumber, abalone, oyster and mussels. In addition, this review profiled a brief knowledge on both current challenges and future scope in aquatic animal polysaccharides field. The review will be a direction of deep processing in fishery resources, which is a hotspot, but technical bottleneck. Furthermore, the review could be served as a useful reference material for further investigation, production and application of polysaccharides from aquatic animals in functional foods and therapeutic agents. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",10.1080/10408398.2018.1512472,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076456074

To identify neuropeptide molecules that play key roles in the modulation, transcriptome analysis of the ganglia (e.g., cerebral and pleuropedal ganglia) of the abalone Haliotis discus hannai was performed. The long-read single-molecule real-time sequencing using the PacBio RSII platform generated 48,344 full-length transcripts, with an N50 length of 3,020 nucleotides (nt), a GC ratio of 44.76%, and a size range of 309-17,545 nt. Of these transcripts, 32,901 (68.1%), 40,515 (83.8%), 7,591 (15.7%), and 14,945 (30.9%) were annotated using the NCBI nonredundant, Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and Cluster of Orthologous Groups databases, respectively. Using in silico data mining, 18 putative neuropeptide genes were identified from the transcriptome of H. discus hannai. Comparative analysis revealed that the sequences of identified neuropeptides of H. discus hannai were conserved with other molluscan neuropeptide homologs; however, some features of H. discus hannai neuropeptides were found distinct from those of other molluscan neuropeptides. Interestingly, this is the first study to report a precursor encoding a DYamide peptide in molluscan, which is likely to be a homolog of DLamide peptides, which have been discovered only in annelids to date. This study provides comprehensive neuronal transcriptome data for H. discus hannai, which could help improve aquaculture methods both practically and economically by providing a basis for neuroendocrine-based strategies. © 2020 National Shellfisheries Association.

However, there are no efficient natural food preservatives or biocontrol agents to control V. vulnificus in seafood. In this study, we isolated and characterized a novel bacteriophage VVP001. Host range and transmission electron microscopy morphology observations revealed that VVP001 belongs to the family Siphoviridae and specifically infects V. vulnificus. Phage stability tests showed that VVP001 is stable at a broad temperature range of −20 °C to 65 °C and a pH range from 3 to 11, which are conditions for food applications (processing, distribution, and storage). In vitro challenge assays revealed that VVP001 inhibited V. vulnificus MO6-24/O (a clinical isolate) growth up to a 3.87 log reduction. In addition, complete genome analysis revealed that the 76 kb VVP001 contains 102 open reading frames with 49.64% G + C content and no gene encoding toxins or other virulence factors, which is essential for food applications. Application of VVP001 to fresh abalone samples contaminated with V. vulnificus demonstrated its ability to inhibit V. vulnificus growth, and an in vivo mouse survival test showed that VVP001 protects mice against high mortality (survival rate >70% at a multiplicity of infection of 1000 for up to 7 days). Therefore, the bacteriophage VVP001 can be used as a good natural food preservative and biocontrol agent for food applications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.fm.2020.103630,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090322643

This study evaluates the impact of macroalgal diets and water temperatures on the colour and tissue pigment deposition in farmed greenlip abalone. Three diets are (a) fresh Ulva sp., (b) a commercial diet and (c) a formulated diet of 30% of dried Ulva sp. meal supplement were used to feed 3-year-old greenlip abalone at either 22 or 26°C for 38 days. Abalone fed 30% dried Ulva sp. meal supplement had significantly higher the shell colour saturation than those fed fresh Ulva sp. The lip colour was deeper in abalone fed fresh Ulva sp. and was significantly more pronounced than those fed the diet containing 30% Ulva sp. meal. Abalone at 22°C had a significantly higher lip colour saturation value than those at 26°C. The foot of abalone fed fresh Ulva sp. was light gold, whereas abalone fed the 30% Ulva sp. meal or the commercial diet had a dark brown foot at 22°C. The foot colour was paler in abalone at 26°C than at 22°C. The content of β-carotene was significantly higher in abalone fed fresh Ulva sp. than those fed the other diets. Abalone contained a higher amount of β-carotene at 22°C than at 26°C. This study indicates that high water temperatures make foot colour paler and the fresh Ulva sp. diet can make the foot colour lighter at 22°C. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/are.14855,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090963153

Based on the basal diet, the other three experimental diets were designed with supplementation of 2 mg/kg of CrYst, 80 mg/kg of ASTA, and 2 mg/kg of CrYst + 80 mg/kg of ASTA, respectively. The results showed that supplementation of 2 mg/kg of dietary CrYst significantly increased weight gain rate and the daily increment in shell length of abalone (P < 0.05). However, 80 mg/kg of dietary astaxanthin supplementation had no significant effects on the growth (P > 0.05). Meanwhile, there were no significant differences in feed intake and feed conversion ratio among all the groups (P > 0.05). Meanwhile, adding 2 mg/kg of CrYst and/or 80 mg/kg of ASTA into the diet improved the anti-oxidative capacity in serum and hepatopancreas, increased the gene expression of hsp70 and hsp90 in the hepatopancreas, and reduced the cumulative mortality and falling rate of abalone during the heat stress.

Gao X.; Pang G.; Luo X.; You W.; Ke C.,Effects of light cycle on motion behaviour and melatonin secretion in Haliotis discus hannai,2021,Aquaculture,532,,,,735981,"The abalone Haliotis discus hannai is a typical nocturnal marine invertebrate. In this study, a quantitative analysis was performed on the motion behaviour characteristics of abalones exposed to different light cycles (0 L:24D, 12 L:12D, 24 L:0D) using infrared camera and behavioural analysis software. A preliminary analysis of the intrinsic correlations between melatonin secretion and abalone behaviour rhythms was also conducted. The results showed that the cumulative moving distance and duration of movement for abalone in the 0 L:24D group were significantly higher than those in the 12 L:12D and 24 L:0D groups (P < 0.05). The mean and maximum moving velocities of abalones in the 12 L:12D group were significantly higher than those in the 0 L:24D group (P < 0.05). The maximum cumulative moving distance and duration of movement for abalone in the 12 L:12D and 24 L:0D groups occurred between 00:00–03:00. In the 0 L:24D group, peak cumulative moving distance and duration movement were recorded between 00:00–03:00 and 15:00–18:00. According to the results of cosine analysis, melatonin content and expression levels of aralkylamine N-acetyl transferase (AANAT) and N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) in the 12 L:12D and 24 L:0D groups showed significant circadian cosine rhythms (P < 0.05) and tended to be higher during the day and lower at night. Compared with the variation trend of melatonin, the expression levels of melatonin receptor (MTR) in each group showed significant circadian cosine rhythms (P < 0.05). Especially in the 0 L:24D group, the expression levels of MTR also tended to be higher during the day and lower at night, indicating that MTR may mediate other factors which participate in the regulation of abalone circadian rhythms. The results of this study provide a quantitative description of the motion behaviour characteristics of abalone exposed to different light cycles. The intrinsic correlation between melatonin secretion and abalone motion behaviour rhythms was also examined in this study, which in turn provides a reference for light regulation and feeding strategies in aquaculture production. © 2020",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735981,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092746222
Yao T.; Lu J.; Bai C.; Xie Z.; Ye L.,The Enhanced Immune Protection in Small Abalone Haliotis diversicolor Against a Secondary Infection With Vibrio harveyi,2021,Frontiers in Immunology,12,,,,685896,"In recent years, more and more studies have shown that early pathogenic bacterial infection in invertebrates can enhance immunity and significantly reduce mortality when reinfected with the same pathogen. There are mechanisms to explain this phenomenon, but they are relatively few. In addition, dose-dependent primary infection is also associated with increased immunity. In the present study, the initial infection dose and mortality of abalone Haliotis diversicolor after reinfection with Vibrio harveyi were recorded, and the mechanism of immune enhancement was investigated by the transcriptomic response of abalone after two successive stimuli with V. harveyi. Priming with different concentrations of pathogen can enhance immunity; however, higher concentration is not always better. Compared with the first exposure, more genes were up-regulated after the second exposure. Among the commonly expressed genes, the immune related genes were significantly or persistently highly expressed after two infections and included pattern recognition receptors as well as immune effectors, such as toll-like receptors, perlucin 4, scavenger receptor class B-like protein, cytochrome P450 1B1-like, glutathione S-transferase 6, lysozyme and so on; in addition, these immune-related genes were mainly distributed in the pathways related to phagocytosis and calcium signaling. Among the specifically expressed genes, compared with the first infection, more genes were involved in the immune, metabolic and digestive pathways after the second infection, which would be more conducive to preventing the invasion of pathogens. This study outlined the mechanism of immune enhancement in abalone after secondary infection at the global molecular level, which is helpful for a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of immune priming in invertebrates. © Copyright © 2021 Yao, Lu, Bai, Xie and Ye.",10.3389/fimmu.2021.685896,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111004509

CXc can be infected by a bacteriophage (pCXc), and both phage-infected and non-phage-infected CXc can coexist with a presumable different species of RLO tentatively named stippled Rickettsiales-like organism (ST-RLO). Currently, the taxonomic affiliation of the ST-RLO is unknown, and no studies have been conducted to determine its presence in infected abalones in the Peninsula of Baja California, Mexico. To determine whether the ST-RLO is a histological variant of CXc or a new species of RLO, we performed histology and species-specific in situ hybridization (ISH) for CXc and pCXc in red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, infected with CXc and hyperparasitized by pCXc, which also showed the presence of the ST-RLO. Additionally, a histological analysis of the presence of all of these RLOs from 2008 to 2019 from an aquaculture facility was performed. The results showed that all ST-RLOs were negative by ISH for CXc and pCXc, suggesting that the ST-RLO is a different species of bacterium and that it is not susceptible to infection by pCXc. Histologically similar alterations to those produced by CXc in the post esophagus were observed. The three RLOs regularly coexist in all the infected abalones, and there is a relatively constant proportion of each kind of RLO over time, suggesting that equilibrium is reached during coexistence; the largest percentage corresponded to CXc non phage infected (81%), followed by CXc infected by pCXc (16%) and the ST-RLO (3%). In all cases, the ST-RLO infection remained at a subclinical level making it difficult to determine if it acts as pathogen or as a commensal. Therefore, the genetic characterization of the ST-RLO and pathogenicity studies are needed to further elucidate the role of this new RLO in the development of of WS in abalone species of North America. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.736026,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092480242

It has regulation functions in glucose metabolism in mammals and fish. In the present study, a gene of the foxo homolog in abalone Haliotis discus hannai was cloned. A conservative forkhead (FH) domain and a transactivation (FoxO-TAD) domain were identified. Abalone foxo-specific siRNA (small interfering RNA) was injected to investigate the functions of foxo on glucose metabo-lism. Knockdown of foxo inhibited expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pepck) and significantly increased expressions of hexokinase (hk) and pyruvate kinase (pk), but it failed to inhibit the relative mRNA level of glucose-6-phosphatase (g6pase). Then, a 100-day feeding trial was conducted to investigate the response of foxo and glucose metabolism in abalone fed with 1.57% (LFD, low-fat diet), 3.82% (MFD, middle-fat diet) and 6.72% (HFD, high-fat diet) of dietary lipid, respectively. The insulin-signaling pathway (AKT) was depressed and FoxO was activated by the HFD, but it did not inhibit glycolysis (hk) or improved gluconeogenesis significantly (pepck and g6pase). At the same time, impaired hepatopancreas glycogen storage raised hemolymph glucose levels. In conclusion, abalone foxo can be regulated by dietary lipid and can regulate gluconeogene-sis or glycolysis in response to changes of dietary lipid levels, in which glycogen metabolism plays an important role. © 2021 by the authors.

Kroeker K.J.; Powell C.; Donham E.M.,Windows of vulnerability: Seasonal mismatches in exposure and resource identity determine ocean acidification’s effect on a primary consumer at high latitude,2021,Global Change Biology,27,5,1042,1051,,"It is well understood that differences in the cues used by consumers and their resources in fluctuating environments can give rise to trophic mismatches governing the emergent effects of global change. Trophic mismatches caused by changes in consumer energetics during periods of low resource availability have received far less attention, although this may be common for consumers during winter when primary producers are limited by light. Even less is understood about these dynamics in marine ecosystems, where consumers must cope with energetically costly changes in CO2-driven carbonate chemistry that will be most pronounced in cold temperatures. This may be especially important for calcified marine herbivores, such as the pinto abalone (Haliotis kamschatkana). H. kamschatkana are of high management concern in the North Pacific due to the active recreational fishery and their importance among traditional cultures, and research suggests they may require more energy to maintain their calcified shells and acid/base balance with ocean acidification. Here we use field surveys to demonstrate seasonal mismatches in the exposure of marine consumers to low pH and algal resource identity during winter in a subpolar, marine ecosystem. We then use these data to test how the effects of exposure to seasonally relevant pH conditions on H. kamschatkana are mediated by seasonal resource identity. We find that exposure to projected future winter pH conditions decreases metabolism and growth, and this effect on growth is pronounced when their diet is limited to the algal species available during winter. Our results suggest that increases in the energetic demands of pinto abalone caused by ocean acidification during winter will be exacerbated by seasonal shifts in their resources. These findings have profound implications for other marine consumers and highlight the importance of considering fluctuations in exposure and resources when inferring the emergent effects of global change. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/gcb.15449,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097839885

This is considered a potential toxicological threat to marine species due to the chemical additives used to make many plastic products, or the persistent organic pollutants that may accumulate on them while residing in the environment. While the presence of MPs in the marine environment is widely documented, there are no other review articles providing a summary of published effect studies of MPs on the immune and reproductive systems of marine species. This manuscript reviews reproductive and immune-system changes in response to MPs in 7 and 9 species, respectively. Some species such as Mytilus galloprovincialis and oyster Crassostrea gigas were investigated in multiple papers. Most studies have been conducted on invertebrates, and only 3 studies have been performed on vertebrates, with exposure times ranging between 30 min and 60 days. A review of the literature revealed that the most common MPs types studied in relation to adverse impacts on immune system and reproductive success in marine species were polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE). The immune system's responses to MPs exposure varied depending on the species, with altered organismal defense mechanisms and neutrophil function observed in fish and changes in lysosomal membrane stability and apoptotic-like nuclear alterations in phagocytes reported in invertebrate species. Reproductive responses to MPs exposure, varied depending on species, but included significant reduction in gamete and oocyte quality, fecundity, sperm swimming speed, and quality of offspring. The lack of published data means that developing a clear understanding of the impact across taxonomic groups with different feeding and behavioral traits is often difficult. Further work is required to better understand the risk MPs pose to the immune and reproductive systems of marine species in order to fully evaluate the impact these ubiquitous pollutants are having on marine ecosystems and the associated goods and services they provide. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111109,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089243716

The larval rearing technique of abalone has produced successfully at Gondol Research and Development Institute for Mariculture, Bali, Indonesia. However, the grow-out of abalone has not well documented yet. The purpose of this experiment is to examine the shelter shape in relation to growth and survival for abalone (Haliotis squamata) grow-out culture in the tidal area. The shelter made from PVC piping. The shape of shelter as a treatment of this experiment was A) round; B) square and; C) without shelter. The data of growth and survival rate were analyzed using analysis of variance. The result showed that the shelter for the grow-out of abalone was significantly affected growth in terms of shell length and wet weight (P<0.05) while the survival did not influence (P>0.05). It seems that the shelter was correlated with the feeding behavior of abalone had resulted in different for their growing. The water quality such as salinity, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, and water current was within the optimal range for abalone. We found that round shelter shape is the best for grow-out abalone at the tidal area. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",10.1088/1755-1315/441/1/012001,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081177161

However, it is not clear whether the F. halioticida isolated from the giant abalone and Yesso scallops are phenotypically and genetically identical to each other. The present study revealed that isolates from the giant abalone and Yesso scallops were phenotypically different, with slower growth in modified eugon broth and a lack of prolyl aminopeptidase and phenylalanine aminopeptidase in Yesso scallop isolates. Additionally, we found that 3 of 8 housekeeping genes were different between them. Based on these phenotypic and genetic differences, we propose that F. halioticida isolated from Yesso scallops in Japan be designated as the 'J-scallop type' to distinguish it from strains from abalone ('abalone type'). Whole-genome sequencing analysis of a strain belonging to the J-scallop type showed that the overall similarity between the J-scallop and abalone type strains was estimated to be 99.84%. In accordance with a lack of prolyl aminopeptidase activity, in general, all of the J-scallop type strains examined have a 1 bp deletion in the responsible gene encoding prolyl aminopeptidase. This deletion was confirmed in all F. halioticida in diseased Yesso scallops examined, suggesting that in Japan, francisellosis of Yesso scallops is caused by a novel type of F. halioticida and not by the abalone type.",10.3354/dao03574,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102797147

One thousand and eighty juvenile abalone were randomly distributed into 18,100 L net cages (sixty per cage). Five formulated diets were prepared. Twenty percent U. pinnatifida was included into the control (Con) diet. Twenty five, 50, 75 and 100% U. pinnatifida were substituted with an equal amount of OEB, referred to as the OEB25, OEB50, OEB75 and OEB100 diets, respectively. Finally, dry U. pinnatifida was prepared to compare formulated diets on growth performance of abalone, referred to as the Undaria. Each diet were randomly assigned to triplicate groups of abalone and fed to abalone once a day to satiety with little leftover for 16 weeks. After the 16-week feeding trial, abalone were subjected to air exposure for 24 h and survival was monitored for the next 4 days. Weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone fed all formulated diets were greater than those of abalone fed the Undaria. The greatest weight gain and SGR were obtained in abalone fed the OEB50 diet, followed by the OEB75, OEB25, Con and OEB100 diets, in that order. Weight gain and SGR of abalone fed the OEB100 diet were lower than those of abalone fed the Con diet. Shell length, width and height and soft body weight of abalone tended to agree with growth rate of abalone. No difference in the chemical composition of the soft body of abalone was observed. The survival of abalone fed the OEB25, OEB50, OEB75 and OEB100 diets was higher than that of abalone fed the Undaria and Con diet at the end of 4-day post observation after 24-h air exposure. In conclusion, U. pinnatifida up to 75% could be replaced with OEB in abalone feed when 20% U. pinnatifida was included. The greatest growth performance was obtained in abalone fed the OEB50 diet. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735718,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088221670
Rogers-Bennett L.; Klamt R.; Catton C.A.,Survivors of Climate Driven Abalone Mass Mortality Exhibit Declines in Health and Reproduction Following Kelp Forest Collapse,2021,Frontiers in Marine Science,8,,,,725134,"Marine ecosystems are vulnerable to climate driven events such as marine heatwaves yet we have a poor understanding of whether they will collapse or recover. Kelp forests are known to be susceptible, and there has been a rise in sea urchin barrens around the world. When temperatures increase so do physiological demands while food resources decline, tightening metabolic constraints. In this case study, we examine red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) looking at sublethal impacts and their prospects for recovery within kelp forests that have shifted to sea urchin barrens. Abalone are a recreationally fished species that once thrived in northern California’s bull kelp forests but have recently suffered mass mortalities since the 2014–2016 marine heatwave. Quantitative data exist on the health and reproduction of abalone both prior to and after the collapse. The survivors of the mass mortality show a 2-year lag in body and gonad condition indices. After the lag, body and gonad indexes decreased substantially, as did the relationship between shell length and body weight. Production of mature eggs per female declined by 99% (p < 0.001), and the number of eggs per gram of female body weight (2,984/g) declined to near zero (9/g). The number of males with sperm was reduced by 33%, and the sperm abundance score was reduced by 28% (p = 0.414). We observed that these reductions were for mature eggs and sperm while immature eggs and spermatids were still present in large numbers. In the lab, after reintroduction of kelp, weight gains were quickly lost following a second starvation period. This example illustrates how climate-driven declines in foundation species can suppress recovery of the system by impacting body condition and future reproduction of surviving individuals. Given the poor reproductive potential of the remaining abalone in northern California, coupled with ongoing mortality and low kelp abundances, we discuss the need to maintain the fishing moratorium and implement active abalone restoration measures. For fished species, such as abalone, this additional hurdle to recovery imposed by changes in climate is critical to understand and incorporate into resource management and restoration. © Copyright © 2021 Rogers-Bennett, Klamt and Catton.",10.3389/fmars.2021.725134,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114317363

The experiment was performed in Lae-Lae Island, Makassar from May to October 2016. The sample Abalone juvenile larvae were 1.5 cm in size and stocked at a density of 30 pcs/cage. The cage size was 30 cm × 15 cm × 7 cm and equipped with a 2-inch Paralone pipe. This experiment employed a completely random design (CRD) with 3 treatments and 3 replicates. The applied treatment included the combination of artificial feed and fresh marine algae Gracilaria sp. Each treatment included: A. 25% artificial feed + 75% fresh marine algae, B. 50% artificial feed + 50% fresh marine algae, C. 75% artificial feed + 25% fresh marine algae, and was given at the proportion of 20% of the abalone's weight. The results of the study indicated that the use of a combined artificial feed with fresh marine algae (Gracilaria sp.) had no significant effect on relative growth and survival rates of Haliotis squamata.

The process of shell biomineralization is controlled by genes and proteins expressed within the mantle epithelium. In this present paper, we conducted a shell regeneration experiment to study the role of HcCNA and HcCNB (individual subunits of calcineurin) in shell biomineralization in H. diversicolor. The results of qPCR showed that HcCNB is upregulated to a greater extent than HcCNA in the mantle after shell notching. In vivo study of the effects of rHcCNB injection showed a significantly higher percentage of regenerated shell length, but not area, in the injected group compared to the control group. In addition, SEM observation of the inner surface of the regenerated shells revealed three different zones including prismatic, nacreous, and a distinct transition zone. Changes in the crystal organization and ultrastructure are clearly evident in these three zones, particularly after 3 weeks of rHcCNB administration. We hypothesize that this is due to faster biomineralization rates in the rHcCNB treated group. Taken together, our results demonstrate that HcCNB participates in shell regeneration in H. diversicolor. As calcineurin subunits have also been implicated in shell formation in bivalves, these findings suggest that calcineurin subunits may play important roles in biomineralization in all conchiferans. © 2021 Buddawong et al.",10.7717/peerj.10662,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099361519

This study employed one-month-old abalone juveniles with an average of 5 g initial weight, devided in two stages, i. e. experimental culture condition and experimental diet and feeding. The parameters observed in in this study are the chemical composition of the tissue of abalone and the relative growth. The results indicated that the formulated feed did not significantly affect the growth rate, survival rate, and chemical composition of tropical abalone reared in the marine submersible cages (P>0.05). However, the growth and survival rate of the abalone had a high percentage. Different percentages in marine algae supplementation contributed to similar reponse regarding growth rate, survival rate and chemical composition of the soft tissue of tropical abalone.

Three semi-purified experimental diets were formulated containing 0.00, 94.52, and 9 649.58 mg/kg of vitamin C supplied as L-ascorbyl-2-monophosphate. The results show that there was no significant difference in weight gain ratio, daily increment in shell length, and survival rate among the three treatments. Adding dietary vitamin C (9 649.58 mg/kg) significantly increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathine peroxidase (GPX), glitathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), and lysozyme in viscera (P<0.05). In muscle, activities of phenoloxidase, catalase, SOD, GST, GR, and AKP were increased in the treatment with 9 649.58 mg/kg of dietary vitamin C (P<0.05). The highest concentrations of ascorbic acid in viscera and muscle were found in the group with 9 649.58 mg/kg of dietary vitamin C (P<0.05). The contents of crude protein and crude lipid in the soft body were significantly increased in the 9 649.58 mg/kg group (P<0.05).

In this study, sulfated polysaccharides from pacific abalone (AGSP) and its desulfated product (D-AGSP) were prepared, and the contribution of sulfate group was analyzed via in vitro and in vivo models. The result showed that sulfate group had no obvious effect on the reaction of AGSP with RAW 264.7 cells, but it affected the growth properties of gut microbes that able to utilize AGSP. The mice experiment showed that D-AGSP reduced weight gain, fat accumulation and lipid metabolism disorder in HFD-fed mice as well as AGSP, and no differences between them were found. Sequencing analysis showed that sulfate group influenced AGSP-induced alterations of the gut microbiota at higher taxonomic levels, some of which had close correlation with the improvement of physiological index. These results implied that sulfate group may partially determine the activities of polysaccharides via gut microbiota-mediated pathway, but the exact mechanisms need further research. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.08.010,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089485962

To explore the potential roles of invertebrate IKKs on immunity, three IKK encoding genes have been identified from molluscan species disk abalone and designed as AbIKK1, AbIKK2 and AbIKK3 at the transcriptional level. Coding sequences of AbIKK1, AbIKK2 and AbIKK3 encode the peptides of 746, 751 and 713 amino acids with the predicted molecular mass of 86.16, 86.12 and 81.88 kDa respectively. All three AbIKKs were found to share conserved IKK family features including the kinase superfamily domain (KD), ubiquitin-like domain (ULD), and α-helical scaffold/dimerization domain (SDD), similar to their mammalian counterparts. Under normal physiological conditions, AbIKKs were ubiquitously detected in six different tissues, with the highest abundance in the digestive tract and gills. Temporal transcriptional profiles in abalone hemocytes revealed the induction of AbIKK1, AbIKK2, and AbIKK3 expression following exposure to Gram-negative (Vibrio parahemolyticus) and Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes) bacteria, viruses (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, VHSV), LPS, or poly I:C. The overexpression of AbIKKs in HEK293T or RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells induced NF-κB promoter activation independent of stimulation by TNF-α or LPS. Moreover, iNOS and COX2 expression was induced in AbIKK transfected RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells and the induced state was maintained post-LPS treatment. Furthermore, mRNA levels of three selected cytokine-encoding genes (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) were found to be elevated in abalone IKK overexpressed RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells, both with and without LPS exposure. Overall, our findings demonstrated that AbIKKs identified in this study were positively involved in eliciting innate immune responses in abalone. In addition, the data revealed the presence of an evolutionarily conserved signaling mechanism for IKK mediated NF-κB activation in mollusks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.fsi.2020.04.029,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084232638

Abalones (initial weight: 10.98 ± 0.05 g) were fed with graded levels of dietary lipid (1.57%, 2.34%, 3.17%, 3.82%, 4.63%, 5.56%, 6.17% and 6.72%). Results showed that weight gain rate (WGR) and increment in shell length of abalone were highest in 3.82% dietary lipid level. Based on the quadratic regression analysis for WGR, the optimal dietary lipid level for abalone was estimated to be 3.87%. Concentrations of the total triacylglycerol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-esterified fatty acids in serum as well as lipid contents in hepatopancreas and muscle were positively related to dietary lipid levels. Compared to the group with 3.82% of dietary lipid, higher (6.72%) and lower (1.57%) dietary lipid down regulated the expression of genes involved in fatty acids transport and lipolysis in hepatopancreas and muscle, which might be related to AMP-activated protein kinase α2 (AMPKα2)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) signaling. Higher dietary lipid (6.72%) down regulated, while lower dietary lipid (1.57%) up-regulated the expressions of genes involved in de-novo lipogenesis in hepatopancreas. Both higher (6.72%) and lower (1.57%) dietary lipid down regulated these genes' expression in muscle. It was found that c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) signaling participate in the regulation of de-novo lipogenesis.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of Spirulina powder-supplemented feeds on abalone growth after 93 days and 125 days of culture. Spirulina particles were attached to the surfaces of abalone feed granules by mixing to prepare Spirulina powder-supplemented abalone feeds. The morphology, components, and thermal stability of the granules were analyzed. Abalone body weight and shell characteristics (size, pigmentation, morphology, and components) were also assessed for evaluating abalone growth. Protein expression patterns in abalones were monitored. Spirulina particles were detected on the surfaces of Spirulina powder-supplemented abalone feed granules, which were not modified in size and shape after attachment. The Spirulina powder-supplemented feed granules included organic materials and minerals based on C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, and Ca. They were thermally stable up to 20 °C. Abalones fed Spirulina powder-supplement at 0.7 % showed significantly increased body weight and shell size after 125-day culture. Shell pigmentation and morphology were also improved. The shell contained C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, and Fe. Abalone proteins were clearly expressed at 75–100 kD and 150–250 kD. These results suggest that Spirulina powder has a promising potential as a feed supplement to be used in next-generation animal feeds for enhanced growth.

Local restoration efforts have focused on outplanting juvenile abalone, which is costly because of the husbandry required to raise abalone to outplanting size. This study tested if hatchery-produced larval pinto abalone could be successfully outplanted and if postoutplant growth of larval abalone differed from hatchery-raised animals. Wild broodstock were spawned, and some larvae remained at the hatchery for rearing, whereas most were transported to the Shannon Point Marine Center (SPMC) for outplanting. At two sites in the Salish Sea, larvae were outplanted at a density of 13,000 larvae m-2into two types of larval abalone modules (LAM): tented LAM (125 μm Nitex tenting) and open LAM (no tenting). There were also control LAM with no tenting and no abalone. Larvae were also seeded in LAM in aquaria at SPMC to compare field and aquaria survival and to estimate emigration. Shell lengths of field, laboratory, and hatchery-reared abalone were measured to better understand if hatchery life compromises early growth. Four months after outplanting, abundance of settled abalone was significantly greater in tented LAM than open and control LAM. Control LAM contained no abalone, suggesting reproduction by wild abalone did not occur at the field sites. Open LAM had a mean outplant success of 0.1% (0-12 settled abalone) and tented LAM a mean success of 0.4% (16-35 settled abalone). Outplant success was higher in SPMC aquaria. Open and tented LAM had 1.5% and 3.0% success, respectively. Abalone found on aquaria walls outside the LAM accounted for 0.2% of the seeded abalone for both open and tented LAM. Four months after outplanting, shell lengths of field abalone were not significantly different from lengths of hatchery-reared abalone, suggesting hatchery conditions did not compromise growth rates of newly settled abalone. These findings suggest that releasing larval pinto abalone into tented field modules has potential to supplement wild stocks in the Salish Sea as a lower cost alternative to outplanting juveniles. © 2020 National Shellfisheries Association.

Three separate trials of an experiment were conducted by exposing juvenile C. concholepas for 1 month to one of two contrasting pCO2 levels (~500 and ~1200 μatm). In addition, each pCO2 level was combined with one of four temperature treatments. The control was 15 °C, whilst the other temperatures were 10 °C (Trial 1), 20 °C (Trial 2) and 25 °C (Trial 3). At the end of each trial, we assessed Critical Thermal maximum (CTmax) and minimum (CTmin) via self-righting success, calculated partial thermal tolerance polygons, measured somatic growth, determined transcription of Heat Shock Proteins 70 (HSP70) and measured oxygen consumption rates. Regardless of pCO2 level, HSP70 transcript levels were significantly higher in juveniles after exposure to extreme temperatures (10 °C and 25 °C) indicating physiological stress. Oxygen consumption rates increased with increasing temperature from 10 °C to 20 °C though showed a decrease at 25 °C. This rate was not affected by pCO2 or the interaction between temperature and pCO2. Juveniles exposed to present-day and near future pCO2 levels at 20 °C showed similar thermal tolerance polygonal areas; whilst changes in both CTmin and CTmax at 25 °C and 10 °C caused narrower and broader areas, respectively. Temperature affected growth, oxygen consumption and HSP70 transcription in small juvenile C. concholepas. Exposure to elevated pCO2 did not affect thermal tolerance, growth or oxygen consumption at temperatures within the thermal range normally experienced by this species in northern Chile (15-20 °C). At elevated pCO2 conditions, however, exposure to warmer (25 °C) or colder (10 °C) temperatures reduced or increased the thermal area, respectively. This study demonstrates the importance of examining the thermal-tolerance edges to better understand how OA and temperature will combine to physiologically challenge inter-tidal organisms. © 2020",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137239,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080036744
Radi K.; Jauffres D.; Deville S.; Martin C.L.,Strength and toughness trade-off optimization of nacre-like ceramic composites,2020,Composites Part B: Engineering,183,,,,107699,"Bio-inspired by abalone nacre, all ceramic brick-and-mortar composites with impressive mechanical properties have been recently manufactured. Albeit comprising only brittle constituents, extrinsic reinforcement mechanisms impart to these nacre-like ceramics high toughness and non-catastrophic crack propagation properties. While several models have been developed to understand the mechanical properties of natural and synthetic brick-and-mortar materials, they have always considered a ductile interface and focused mostly on intrinsic toughening mechanisms. Modeling so far has not captured the extrinsic toughening mechanisms responsible for the properties of nacre-like ceramics. Here we show that the Discrete Element Method (DEM) can account for reinforcement mechanisms such as microcracking and crack deflection, and quantitatively assess strength, initiation toughness and crack growth toughness. Two approaches are studied to enhance strength and toughness of nacre-like ceramics, either by reinforcing the interface globally (an increase of the interface strength) or locally (addition of nano-bridges). We combine the results to provide design guidelines for synthetic brick-and-mortar composites comprising only brittle constituents. © 2019",10.1016/j.compositesb.2019.107699,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077026364

Its role in the mollusk shell formation has also been gradually established. Using Haliotis diversicolor as a model, we characterized the HdBMP2/4 gene in the mantle tissue and showed its expression in the outer fold epithelium (particularly at the periostracal groove) the epithelial site which is involved in shell formation, both prismatic and nacreous layers. Shell notching experiments following gene analysis by qPCR revealed the upregulation of the HdBMP2/4 gene up to 3.2-fold than that of the control animals. In vitro treatments of the preosteoblastic cells, MC3T3-E1 with HdBMP2/4 synthetic peptide demonstrated the enhanced effect of many osteogenic genes that are known to regulate bone and shell biomineralization including ALP, Runx2, and OCN with 2–4 fold-change throughout 14 days of culture. In addition, the increased deposition of calcium-based mineral (as assessed by Alizarin red staining) of the treated cells was comparable to the ascorbic acid (Vit C) + glycerophosphate positive control which revealed the enhanced effect of HdBMP2/4 peptide on matrix biomineralization of the preosteoblastic cells. In conclusion, these results indicated the presence of the HdBMP2/4 gene in the mantle tissue at the site involved in shell formation and the effect of the HdBMP2/4 knuckle epitope peptide in osteoinduction in vitro. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10126-021-10071-2,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116455501

To find microbial indicators associated with faster abalone growth and hence the economics of abalone aquaculture, we performed a metabarcoding analysis of the intestinal microbial community in Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) with different growth rates. Two groups of Pacific abalone of different sizes were selected from a population that originated from the same fertilization batch grown in indoor tanks for 750 days post-fertilization: small (S; 4.24 ± 1.89 g; n = 8) and large (L; 24.47 ± 4.65 g; n = 8). We then performed DNA isolation using intestines dissected from the Pacific abalone in both groups, followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 16S rRNA gene. Overall, an average of 75,643 reads, of which 415.8–424.9 bp were obtained via Illumina MiSeq analysis. Taxonomic classification of the 16S rRNA gene identified up to 1032 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) per group and more than 807 microbial genera were detected at least twice from all intestinal metabarcoding DNA samples analyzed. Principal coordinate analysis indicated that there was a clear distinction between groups. The most dominant genus among the intestinal samples in both size groups was Mycoplasma, followed by Psychrilyobacter, Vibrio, and Algibacter. The microbial genus that were more prevalent in large than small abalone were Mycoplasma (32.3635 ± 4.356%), followed by Psychrilyobacter (17.305 ± 8.179) and unclassified species belonging to Mycoplasmataceae (2.930 ± 0.794%), and Rhodospirillaceae (2.555 ± 0.486%). The microbial genera more prevalent in small abalone were as follows: Algibacter (4.944 ± 0.969%), Shewanella (3.037 ± 0.589%), and Haloferula (2.810 ± 0.445). A higher ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes was observed in large abalone (1.067 ± 0.694) than in small abalone (0.027 ± 0.013). The species richness within each group was assessed based on OTUs (L: 371.38 ± 136.40, S: 837.63 ± 138.99, P ≤ 0.001), the Chao1 index (L: 380.31 ± 141.03, S: 860.18 ± 151.01), and abundance-based coverage estimator values (L: 391.89 ± 147.17, S: 888.19 ± 163.38). Species diversity was compared between groups based on the Shannon index (L: 2.82 ± 0.5, S: 4.41 ± 0.11, P ≤ 0.001). These results indicated that microbial species diversity was higher in small abalone with slower growth rates. Understanding changes in the characteristics of intestinal microbial populations in Pacific abalones, and the relationship thereof with growth rates, will provide a basis for developing a microbiota-based strategy for abalone aquaculture. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.736500,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100991240

It is an economically crucial species; however, its population has been declining due to overfishing and overexploitation. In this study, the suitable salinity for juvenile L. canarium was between 20 and 35‰. Diatoms and biological detritus by using flow-water from the fish pool were the most favorable diets for newly metamorphosed and 10 mm juveniles. In the polyculture experiment, L. canarium was cultured with whiteleg shrimp, tilapia, small abalone, purple sea urchin, and collector urchin. Better growth was found in all co-culture groups except with whiteleg shrimp. We also found that the polyculture system with or without substrates significantly affected the growth of juveniles. Additionally, we observed that water temperature was the most crucial factor for growth and survival; a water temperature of less than 10◦C might cause the death of L. canarium. We have proposed a novel polyculture and water-flow method for mass production of L. canarium and evaluated the feasibility and benefits of polyculture with other species. The findings from this work reveal the potentiality of L. canarium in integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) and its implication for aquaculture and resource restoration. © 2021 by the authors.

The I84 family of protease inhibitors in the MEROPS database represents a novel protease inhibitor family that has been reported in 2 bivalves, Crassostrea virginica and Sinonovacula constricta, and is believed to play a role in host defense. In the present study, 7 new members of Family I84 were identified in 2 bivalves, Meretrix meretrix and Mytilus galloprovincialis, and 1 gastropod, Haliotis discus hannai, at the mRNA level via cDNA cloning. The expression patterns of the newly identified genes varied in response to salinity stresses and pathogen-associated molecular pattern stimulations, suggesting their involvement in the host defense of related species. Additionally, analyses of sequence data in public databases did not reveal any Family I84 protease inhibitor molecules in non-molluscan animals. The results indicated that Family I84 protease inhibitors are likely mollusk specific, constituting a unique host defense mechanism in molluscan species. © 2021 Inter-Research.

The fish experiment on catfish was conducted up to 12 weeks and analyzed on the weight, length size, survival rate and digestibility for the three types of SMS based feed in pellet form and a commercial pellet that applied for ten catfish each. Among the SMS based fish feed, Ganoderma obtained the highest weight of 32.46 g followed by White (30.71 g) and Abalone (17.74 g). For the length size, Ganoderma, White and Abalone SMS based feed had achieved in average 18.05 cm, 17.12 cm and 14.85 cm respectively. Commercial feed still manage to obtain the highest weight and length size as 39.33 g and 20.83 cm respectively. The survival rate was found 30 % higher in SMS based feed compared to commercial feed. The digestibility study of dry matter for Ganoderma, White and Abalone SMS based feed were found 77.34 %, 78.20 %, 77.76 % respectively whereas for commercial pellet was 60.92 % indicates that SMS based feed was consumed and digested better than commercial feed. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Bassett C.N.; Andrus C.F.T.,Examining the potential of Pacific abalone as a novel high-resolution archive of upwelling in the California Current,2021,"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology",571,,,,110342,"Upwelling is a dynamic oceanographic process that brings cold, nutrient-rich waters to the surface. These nutrients encourage primary productivity, forming the foundation of coastal food webs and the fisheries depending on them. Understanding past variability in the occurrence of upwelling and primary productivity may offer insight into how upwelling dynamics and ecosystem productivity could vary in the future. Numerous proxies from sediment cores inform most upwelling reconstructions; however, their temporal resolution is typically decadal at best. However, questions regarding ecosystem responses to changes in physical processes require data with seasonal to sub-seasonal resolution because such data provide additional insight into seasonal extremes (e.g., surface temperature, precipitation, etc.). The calcium carbonate skeletons of mollusks provide invaluable data from stable oxygen (δ18O) and carbon (δ13C) isotopes that generate high-resolution reconstructions of environmental variables. Recent studies of stable nitrogen (δ15N) isotopes in mollusk shell organic materials demonstrate the potential to produce high-resolution reconstructions of nutrient cycling. Collectively, these measurements may provide insight into upwelling conditions over the life of the organism. This study presents preliminary data exploring the potential of analyzing a suite of stable nitrogen, oxygen and carbon isotope data from analysis of Pacific abalone shells (Haliotis cracherodii). We present sub-seasonal δ15N time series data that, together with δ18O and δ13C, reflect seasonal variability closely linked to upwelling. δ15N values range from 8.3‰ to 11.0‰ and align closely with δ18O values, which range from −0.5‰ to 1.1‰. Implications of this research are twofold: 1) Isotopic analyses from abalone shells may provide detailed knowledge on primary productivity during upwelling as well as limited productivity when upwelling is greatly reduced and 2) archaeological shell middens in the Channel Islands contain an abundance of both abalone dating back to the early Holocene, presenting the opportunity to reconstruct upwelling conditions throughout the Holocene. © 2021",10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110342,Note,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102624046
Asad M.; Qamar U.; Abbas M.,Blood Glucose Level Prediction of Diabetic Type 1 Patients Using Nonlinear Autoregressive Neural Networks,2021,Journal of Healthcare Engineering,2021,,,,6611091,"Diabetes type 1 is a chronic disease which is increasing at an alarming rate throughout the world. Studies reveal that the complications associated with diabetes can be reduced by proper management of the disease by continuously monitoring and forecasting the blood glucose level of patients. Objective. The prior prediction of blood glucose level is necessary to overcome the lag time for insulin absorption in diabetic type 1 patients. Method. In this research, we use continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data to predict future blood glucose level using the previous data points. We compare two neural network techniques. We apply the optimal feedforward neural network and then propose optimal nonlinear autoregressive neural networks for blood glucose prediction 15-30 minutes earlier for diabetic type 1 patients. We validate the proposed model with 2 virtual subjects using their 24-hour blood glucose level data. These two case studies have been compiled from AIDA, i.e., the freeware mathematical diabetes simulator. Results. In the prediction horizon (PH) of 15 and 30 minutes, improved results have been shown for minimal inputs for blood glucose level of a particular subject. Root mean square error (RMSE) is used for performance calculation. For the optimal feedforward neural network, the RMSE is 0.9984 and 3.78 ml/dl, and for the optimal nonlinear autoregressive neural network, it reduces the RMSE to 0.60 and 1.12 ml/dl for 15 min and 30 min prediction horizons, respectively, for subject 1. Similarly, for subject 2 for the optimal feedforward neural network, RMSE is 1.43 and 3.51 ml/dl which is improved using the optimal autoregressive neural network to 0.7911 and 1.6756 ml/dl for 15 min and 30 min prediction horizons, respectively. Validation. We further validate our proposed model using UCI machine learning datasets (Abalone and Servo), and it shows improved results on that as well. Conclusion and Future Work. The proposed optimal nonlinear autoregressive neural network model performs better than the feedforward neural network model for these time series data. In the future, we intend to investigate a greater collection of AIDA scenarios and data that are real and influence other factors of BGLs. © 2021 Muhammad Asad et al.",10.1155/2021/6611091,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102364386

Abalone is one of Indonesian marine resources with great potential to be developed. The high demand for abalone is usually not met with enough supplies, resulting in its expensive price. Sources are scattered and in remote locations, creating the need for marketing institutions. The study took place in Bajo Bahari village (Buton regency) and Baubau (a city in Southeast Sulawesi), Indonesia. The data was initially collected in February to May 2015, and later in March 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. The study consists of all 30 Bajo Bahari abalone fishermen. Additionally, 5 abalone merchants were chosen using snowball sampling method; which consists of 3 village abalone collector (VAC) and 2 wholesalers who act as the inter-island abalone trader (IAT). The abalone marketing performance was analyzed through the marketing margin and the fishermen's share, by first identifying the marketing channels. Results show two marketing channels were created, channel I (fishermen as producers→VAC→IAT) and channel II (fishermen as producers→IAT). Channel II showed better performance compared to channel I. Channel II had lower marketing margin (IDR 58,333) and high fishermen’s share, 72%. In contrast, channel I showed higher marketing margin (IDR 127,778) and low fishermen’s share, 16%. The Covid-19 pandemic poses challenges to the local abalone marketing, where fishing activities are stopped and disrupted the overall abalone marketing in Buton Island. © 2020, BIOFLUX SRL.

This study was proposed to evaluate the feeding preference (feed response and feed intake) and the growth performance of early adult H. squamata on some macroalgae. Seven species of macroalgae were evaluated as unpair feeding choice and the experiment design employed was completely randomized design. The results showed that H. squamata responded variously to the seven macroalgae species and the food deprivation (fasting) data showed mounting response to all macroalgae. Ulva lactuca and Enteromorpha sp. were the most responded which up to four times higher compared to the least responded i.e. Halymenia sp. and Sargassum sp. The highest to the lowest palatable feed intake (FI) were Gracillaria sp, Eucheuma spinosum, Ulva lactuca, Halymenia sp., Enteromorpha sp., Sargassum sp. and Hypnea sp. respectively. The first four palatable macroalgae resulted in various growth responses of H. squamata. Except for Halymenia sp., the feed intake (FI) rate showed an opposite linear correlation to growth response and FCR. The daily growth rate (g/day) was Ulva lactuca (0.104), Enteropmorpha sp.

The results showed that compared with 30.49% of dietary protein, 17.64% and 43.27% of dietary protein levels significantly decreased the weight gain rate and the activities of α-amylase, trypsin, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in the hepatopancreas and serum of abalone (P < 0.05). Abalone fed 30.49% of dietary protein had the highest activity of superoxidase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, lysozyme and the total anti-oxidative capacity, and the lowest content of malondialdehyde in the serum and hepatopancreas (P < 0.05). The gene expressions of TOR, S6k, Bcl-2, IκB, NfκB, TNF-α and Nrf2 were significantly up-regulated in the group with 30.49% of dietary protein (P < 0.05).

The inclusion of dried macroalgal meals in formulated diets may also provide other benefits such as improvement in growth, health and survival. In this 92 d study, energy allocation in Greenlip Abalone, Haliotis laevigata, fed either a commercial diet, the control diet (0% macroalgae meal inclusion), or diets containing three inclusion levels (5, 10 and 20%) of either of two enriched macroalgae meals, Gracilaria cliftonii and Ulva sp., was investigated. Energy budget models, which also accounted for shell growth energy and mucus production energy, were determined for each diet. Results varied in relation to energy budget components and diets. Overall, abalone fed the enriched G. cliftonii ingested significantly more dietary energy and exhibited higher somatic growth energy compared to those fed the commercial diet, the 0% control diet or the enriched Ulva sp. diets. Additionally, ingested feed energy decreased while somatic growth energy tended to increase with increasing enriched G. cliftonii meal inclusion level. In contrast, inclusion at any level with enriched Ulva sp. meal did not result in an improvement of somatic growth energy compared to the commercial or the 0% control diet. For ingested feed energy, 20% enriched Ulva sp. meal inclusion resulted in significantly higher values compared to either the commercial diet, control diet or the two other enriched Ulva sp. meal diets. However, abalone fed the 20% dried Ulva sp. meal diet lost significantly more energy through faecal egestion than those fed the commercial or the 0% control diets, suggesting reduced diet digestibility with increasing enriched Ulva sp. inclusion. The majority of ingested feed energy was allocated to somatic growth across treatments, while shell growth energy accounted for the smallest proportion of the energy budgets. Results suggest that the inclusion of enriched G. cliftonii meal (10% inclusion optimum) in formulated diets for Greenlip Abalone has energetic benefits for feed utilisation and growth which may lead to improved business productivity. Inclusion of selected macroalgae species in formulated diets for abalone is an approach where the benefits from feeding live macroalgae can be successfully transferred into these diets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735816,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090940053

Abalones (initial body weight: 15.88–16.54 g; initial shell length 41.70–42.40 mm) were fed nine isoenergetic (~16.08 kJ/g) and isolipidic (~42.0 g/kg) experimental diets with 93.5, 116.9, 151.1, 191.8, 230.3, 275.9, 320.3, 360.5 and 405.9 g/kg protein contents, respectively. Results showed that the optimal dietary protein level for H. discus hannai was determined as 259.4 g/kg through second-order polynomial regression analysis for weight gain rate (WGR). Serum TP and urea nitrogen levels were significantly increased when dietary protein levels were higher than 320.3 g/kg (p <.05). The highest gene expressions of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3 K), target of rapamycin (mTOR) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6 K) in muscle were found in the treatment with 275.9 g/kg of dietary protein. The excessive dietary protein level (405.9 g/kg) significantly decreased the gene expression of S6 K. Meanwhile, abalone fed with 275.9 g/kg of dietary protein exhibited the highest microbial diversity in intestine as measured by Chao richness and Shannon diversity index. In conclusion, dietary protein level reduced from 259.4 g/kg to 154.0 g/kg or increased from 259.4 to 323.0 g/kg, the WGR of abalone might be depressed with 5% likelihood.

V. ampullacea perryi, the so-called “false abalone,” is a popular inexpensive seafood along the northern coast of China. The mucus secreted by the pleopod gland of this animal has always been considered a waste product. Here, we used traditional biochemical methods, MTT assays, and metabolomics analyses to determine the composition of the mucus and explore its potential value as a source of bioactive molecules. Crude protein was the major nutrient contained in the mucus of V. ampullacea perryi, and these proteins had anti-cancer potential. In addition, we identified and annotated 332 metabolites in the mucus. Of these, 61.75% had pharmacological functions, 3.61% could be used as cosmetics additives, and 9.04% had nutritional value.

The energy budgets of abalone fed live macroalgae (Ulva sp. or Gracilaria cliftonii) and an equal mix of those two macroalgae species with and without nutrient enrichment, or one of three control formulated commercial diets, at 22°C for 93 days were investigated. Among non-enriched algal treatments, abalone fed G. cliftonii and mixed diet treatments had significantly higher ingested feed energy and absorbed energy than those fed Ulva sp. Abalone fed non-enriched G. cliftonii invested significantly more energy into somatic growth than those fed Ulva sp. and the mixed diet treatment. For diets with nutrient enrichment, ingested feed energy and absorbed energy rate of abalone fed G. cliftonii and mixed diet treatments were significantly higher than those fed Ulva sp. Nutrient enrichment increased crude protein in live macroalgae, and ammonia excretion energy rate was higher for abalone fed enriched macroalgae compared to non-enriched. Abalone fed the control commercial diets spent more energy in all components compared to those fed the live macroalgae treatments. The major component of the energy budgets in abalone fed the commercial diets and live macroalgae diets was somatic growth energy, ranging from 25.5% to 37.7% of ingested feed energy, except for abalone fed live Ulva sp. where the major component was respiration energy (38.5%). Overall, abalone fed the formulated diets or live non-enriched G. cliftonii could increase ingested feed energy, absorbed energy and somatic growth energy. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/are.14832,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090057108
Pitcher G.C.; Louw D.C.,Harmful algal blooms of the Benguela eastern boundary upwelling system,2021,Harmful Algae,102,,,,101898,"The Benguela Upwelling System (BUS) is subject to a high incidence of HABs. Of the major shellfish poisoning syndromes associated with HABs, Paralytic and Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP and DSP) pose the greatest concern, but as documented herein there are several other HAB organisms that are also present. Blooms of Alexandrium catenella have been recognised as the typical cause of PSP since 1948. In addition to the risk posed to human health A. catenella has also been the cause of large shellfish and bird mortalities. An additional risk of PSP is provided by Alexandrium minutum first detected in Cape Town harbour in 2003. DSP was identified on the South African coast for the first time in 1991. Although several Dinophysis spp. known to cause DSP have been recognized as a component of the plankton of the region, it is accepted that DSP is usually attributed to D. acuminata or D. fortii. In the southern Benguela both Pseudo-nitzschia australis and Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries have been identified and shown to produce domoic acid. Multiple Pseudo-nitzschia spp. have been identified in the northern Benguela with the potentially toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia pungens and P. australis dominant inshore. The yessotoxin (YTX) producing dinoflagellates Gonyaulax spinifera, Lingulodinium polyedrum and Protoceratium reticulatum are all known to form blooms and YTXs have been the cause of massive mortalities of farmed abalone. Prominent fish-killing blooms include Karlodinium veneficum in the northern Benguela and Karenia cristata in the southern Benguela. Shellfish farms in an embayment of the southern Benguela have suffered reduced growth rates due to the ecosystem disruptive blooms of Aureococcus anophagefferens. High biomass dinoflagellate blooms often attributed to Tripos and Prorocentrum spp. characterise the entire region and major mortalities of marine life are regularly attributed to their decay and the subsequent development of anoxic conditions. © 2020",10.1016/j.hal.2020.101898,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090122498

Seasonal oscillations of oceanographic factors additionally influence their physiology, stress responses and survival. Tissue responses to seasonal variations in green ormer (Haliotis tuberculata L.) and Mediterranean scallop (Pecten jacobaeus L.) in the Northern Adriatic have not been reported. Hence, their biochemical and antioxidant defense properties over seasons were studied and the microanatomical structure of their tissue was correlated with function. Histological analysis of gonads revealed two peaks of gonadal maturation and spawning during the spring/summer period and winter season for scallops, and one peak during the fall for ormers. The gonadal maturation of both species was correlated with their seasonal variations of metabolic demands and antioxidant capacity. The lipid vacuoles of tubuloacinar terminations in the digestive gland differed between the two species; in scallop they are several-fold larger in size and number. Low temperatures in winter contributed to a decline in enzymatic antioxidant defense in scallop tissues, having lower superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, and higher concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and total antioxidant status (TAS). In ormers, winter induced lower TAS, TBARS, SOD and GPx concentrations. The significant difference of winter TAS and TBARS levels between ormers and scallops was correlated with variations in their reproductive cycles, as well as in antioxidant defense systems. The most important factor for stress-related parameters for both species in this work was found to be the season-induced temperature change. © 2021 by the authors.

One thou-sand and fifty small abalone (initial weight of 2.7 g) and five hundred forty large one (initial weight of 16.0 g) were distributed into 15 and 18 containers in Trial 1 and 2, respectively. Five and six experimental diets containing crude protein level from 20% to 40% and 20% to 45% with 5% increment of protein level for the small and large abalone were prepared and referred to as the CP20, CP25, CP30, CP35, CP40, and CP45 diets, respectively. The experimental diets were fed to abalone for 16 weeks in Trials 1 and 2. Specific growth rate (SGR) of the small abalone fed the CP20 diet was lower compared to that of abalone fed all other diets in Trial 1. Growth performance (weight gain and SGR) of the large abalone fed the CP30, CP35, and CP40 diets were greater than that of abalone fed the CP20, CP25, and CP45 diets in Trial 2. Dietary protein requirements were estimated to be 33.0% and 33.5% for the small and large abalone based on the 2nd order polynomial analysis, respectively. Dietary protein requirements for the small abalone grown from 2.7 g to 7.4 g and the large one grown from 16 g to 21 g were estimated to be 33.0% and 33.5%, respectively.

This study examined the effect of three probiotic candidates (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens MA228, Enterobacter ludwigii MA208, and Pediococcus acidilactici MA160) on the growth and survival rates of juvenile abalone, Haliotis asinina L). The three probionts were incorporated as a mixture of two or three onto Gracilaria sp. and fed to juvenile abalone for 62 days. Then, specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and survival rate (SR) were measured. The results showed that the increments in weight and length were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the abalone that received a mixture of probionts. While feed conversion ratio (FCR) was significantly lower than the control. The supplementation of B. amyloliquefaciens MA228 and E. ludwigii MA208 (2P) in the Gracilaria sp. resulted in an increase of 9% SGR in terms of weight and decreased FCR value 0.2 unit, compared with the control. However, there was no difference in the survival rates between the mix of 2 and 3 probionts, > 72% among the treatments and control. Our study shows that the growth of juvenile abalone could be improved through probiotic supplementation. Thus, E. ludwigii MA208 and B. amyloliquefaciens MA228 are considered potential probionts which can be used to shorten culture period of abalone aquaculture. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/s10499-019-00473-4,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074659820
Huang Z.; Petersen J.M.; You W.; Shao Z.,"A novel SAR324 bacterium associated with abalone, Haliotis diversicolor",2021,Aquaculture Research,52,5,1945,1953,,"Bacteria affiliated to the Deltaproteobacteria dominate intestinal microbial communities in the abalone, Haliotis diversicolor, and may colonize the host's digestive gland, raising the possibility that they contribute to digestion of macroalgae. However, the phylogenetic, and genomic and metabolic characteristics of these Deltaproteobacteria, and the nature of their relationship to abalone host remain elusive. Here, we examined the intestinal microbial composition of H. diversicolor using high-throughput sequencing and described the genomic characteristics of the Deltaproteobacteria phylotype using genome-centric metagenomics. High-throughput sequencing confirmed that one Deltaproteobacteria phylotype was predominant in intestinal microbiota of H. diversicolor. Phylogeny analysis based on full-length 16S rRNA gene allocated this bacterium to a distinct and unique cluster within SAR324. It possessed a genome of at least 1.59 Mb with 35.15 mol% GC content, much smaller than other sequenced free-living SAR324 bacteria. According to genome annotation and metabolic reconstruction, ATP binding cassette transporters for sugars and carbohydrate metabolism pathways indicated heterotrophic potential. Interestingly, it encoded polysaccharide lyases, which, if expressed, could help the host to digest its macroalgae diet. In contrast to the known SAR324, no sulphur oxidation or carbon fixation pathways were predicted. We propose that this is a unique and specific SAR324 bacterium in symbiosis with Haliotis. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/are.15043,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097429317

This resilience is one of the reasons why this species is such an interesting model for studying processes such as the immune response. In this work, we stimulated mussel hemocytes with poly I:C, β-glucans, and LPS and then sequenced hemocyte mRNAs (transcriptome) and microRNAs (miRNome) to investigate the molecular basis of the innate immune responses against these pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). An immune transcriptome comprising 219,765 transcripts and an overview of the mussel miRNome based on 5,175,567 non-redundant miRNA reads were obtained. The expression analyses showed opposite results in the transcriptome and miRNome; LPS was the stimulus that triggered the highest transcriptomic response, with 648 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), while poly I:C was the stimulus that triggered the highest miRNA response, with 240 DE miRNAs. Our results reveal a powerful immune response to LPS as well as activation of certain immunometabolism- and ageing/senescence-related processes in response to all the immune challenges. Poly I:C exhibited powerful stimulating properties in mussels, since it triggered the highest miRNomic response and modulated important genes related to energy demand; these effects could be related to the stronger activation of these hemocytes (increased phagocytosis, increased NO synthesis, and increased velocity and accumulated distance). The transcriptome results suggest that after LPS stimulation, pathogen recognition, homeostasis and cell survival processes were activated, and phagocytosis was induced by LPS. β-glucans elicited a response related to cholesterol metabolism, which is important during the immune response, and it was the only stimulus that induced the synthesis of ROS. These results suggest a specific and distinct response of hemocytes to each stimulus from a transcriptomic, miRNomic, and functional point of view. © Copyright © 2020 Moreira, Romero, Rey-Campos, Pereiro, Rosani, Novoa and Figueras.",10.3389/fimmu.2020.606102,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098656869

The concentration of HCB porogen varied among 10, 20, 30, and 40 wt%. The Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis revealed that the Ca/P molar ratio of CHA was 1.73, which was close to natural bone's Ca/P molar ratio of 1.71. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD) tests revealed that the formed phase of the synthesized CHA was of the B-type. Analysis of the pores structure showed an increasing porogen concentration, pores size, and porosity of the scaffold. The addition of HCB porogen also decreased the crystallite size. This was very good for bone growth because the low crystallinity created dislocations, making it easier for cells to proliferate. Based on the results of cell viability assay on scaffold CHA + HCB 40 wt%, the growth of MC3T3E1 cells was inhibited beginning at a scaffold concentration of 500 μg/mL because the percentage of viability decreased to ∼ 115 % and the IC50 value of MC3T3E1 cells on the scaffold to 691830.97 μg/mL. Based on to the one-way ANOVA, those result reflected no statistically significant differences in the average of cell viability value in the five groups (p > 0.05). The cell metabolic activity and morphology of the CHA + HCB 40 wt% scaffold enable it to facilitate the attachment of MC3T3E1 cells on its surface. Thus, HCB 40 wt% was the best concentration to fabricate the scaffold based on the criteria for pores structure, crystallographic properties, chemical decomposition process and cell viability for biomedical applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.mtcomm.2021.102135,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101332329

However, the biological efficacy of nano-selenium has not been comprehensively and accurately evaluated due to its dispersion instability. RESULTS: In this study, novel selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) with high dispersion stability were successfully prepared using a polysaccharide-protein complex (PSP) as the capping agent. This was isolated from abalone viscera. The average particle size and zeta potential of polysaccharide-protein complex selenium nanoparticles (PSP-SeNPs) were 63.33 nm, and −37.1 mV, respectively. The SeNPs were firmly capped by PSP through Se-O and Se-N bonds, as demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Due to this capping, the dispersion of PSP-SeNPs remained stable for 12 months at 4 °C, as evidenced by visual inspection and multiple light scattering. Furthermore, PSP-SeNPs imparted an excellent growth-promoting effect on tilapia. The FBW, WGR, and SGR values of tilapia juveniles fed with PSP-SeNPs supplemented diets (0.5–4.5 mg/kg) were significantly higher than those of the control (P < 0.05). A weight gain rate of 4.1%–43.4% and specific growth rate of 0.15%–1.74% were obtained in tilapia during 45-day feeding. CONCLUSIONS: The use of marine viscera polysaccharides is a promising, green method for the synthesis of selenium nanoparticles. There are good opportunities for the application of the synthesized PSP-SeNPs in the life sciences. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry",10.1002/jsfa.10656,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089379396

The protein, carbohydrate, lipid, and ash contents of abalone muscle were 15.87, 6.36, 0.22, and 1.36 g/100 g, respectively. Most of the carbohydrates in the abalone muscle were released easily into water, and potassium was the most abundant mineral. WF and SP were rich in essential and umami amino acids, and all three fractions had high arginine contents. The essential amino acid index and predicted biological value of WF were 75.84 and 90.96, respectively. These values were considerably higher than those of MP and SP. Meanwhile, the predicted protein efficiency ratio of MP was the highest. Lysine was the first limiting essential amino acid (EAA) in MP and SP, and the score of the first limiting EAA (tryptophan) in WF was more than 100%. The in vitro protein digestibility of WF and SP was approximately 92% higher than that of MP. The in vivo experiments showed that WF was the easiest to digest.

Abalone survival was monitored over 25 days, and growth was quantified by measuring abalone shell length. Results confirmed that V. midae K811 has a probiotic effect on post-larval H. midae by significantly improving survival and promoting a three-fold increase in the growth rate of these animals.

The high water temperature in the middle of the summer season frequently limits the aquaculture productivity of abalone. To cope with the problem, this study aimed to investigate viability, attachment rate, changes of immune response, and physiological properties of juvenile small abalone Haliotis diversicolor aquatilis against high water temperature stress under60CO-gamma irradiation-mediated hormetic effects. To examine physiological changes of abalone, the gamma-ray irradiated and non-irradiated groups were distinguished by grouping a total of 70 abalones in a treated group and a control group (each group included twenty-five female and ten male abalones). The treated group was exposed to60CO-gamma irradiation using a designed experimental apparatus, the control group was not. Our results revealed that the low level of gamma ray (20 Gy)-irradiated Haliotis diversicolor aquatilis showed a 100% survival rate during the experiment. After gamma ray exposure, all the abalones were cultured without feeding and bioactivities were measured to examine gamma ray-induced physiological responses. The results suggested the potential for selective breeding using gamma ray irradiation hormesis to manipulate the number of eggs, fertilization rate, hatching rate, and attachment rate. The shell length of juvenile abalone was significantly enhanced by a 20 Gy radiation dose. We could presume that the effect of hormesis in the gamma-ray irradiation parent shellfish also had a genetic effect on the offspring. In order to verify changes in immune response and stress tolerance of abalone under high temperature stress, lysozyme activity and survival rates were compared at a water temperature of 30◦C. Interestingly, the60Co gamma ray-irradiated abalones exhibited almost a 1.65-fold enhanced survival rate along with reduced lysozyme activity after 12 h of high temperature stress. Our results speculate that low levels of60Co gamma ray-mediated hormetic effects can be an effective strategy for shell length growth and high temperature stress tolerance. © 2020 by the authors.

However, nothing is known about gene expression of triploid abalone to modulate physiological responses under different environmental stresses. Transcriptomic response to the acute heat-stress and hypoxia were explored in hepatopancreas of diploid and triploid Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) juveniles.

Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the E-test. Genes encoding antimicrobial resistance and invasiveness factors were examined by PCR. A total of 27 strains were obtained from 326 mastitis milk samples. Streptococcus parauberis isolates (n=11) showed high resistance to erythromycin (90.9%), followed by tetracycline (45.5%), chloramphenicol (36.4%) and clindamycin (27.3%). Streptococcus uberis isolates (n=16) were highly resistant to tetracycline (81.3%) and clindamycin (62.5%). Both species were susceptible to ampicillin. The most prevalent resistance gene in S. uberis was tetM (80.0%), followed by blaZ (62.5%) and ermB (62.5%). However, tetM, blaZ, and ermB genes were only found in 27.3, 45.5, and 27.3%, respectively, of S. parauberis. In addition, all of the isolates carried at least one selected virulence-related gene. The most prevalent virulence-associated gene pattern in the current study was sua+pauA/skc+gapC+hasC detected in 22.2% of the strains. One S. uberis strain carried 7 virulence-associated genes and belonged to the sua+pauA/skc+gapC+cfu+hasA+hasB+hasC pattern. More than 59.3% of analysed strains carried 4 to 7 virulence-related genes. Our findings demonstrated that S. parauberis and S. uberis isolated from clinical bovine mastitis cases in China exhibited diverse molecular ecology, and that the strains were highly resistant to antibiotics commonly used in the dairy cow industry. The data obtained in the current study contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of bacteria in mastitis caused by these pathogens, and the findings are relevant to the development of multivalent vaccines and targeted prevention procedures. © 2020 CAAS.

Results indicate that U. armoricana is an important dietary ingredient for gonad production, accounting for an average of 37.33 ± 1.03% of the isotopic signal recorded for gonads at the end of the growth trial. This is significantly more than fish meal and soya, which only contributed an average of 11.40 ± 1.81 and 3.80 ± 0.09%, respectively, of the isotopic signal of the gonads. Maize and wheat each account for almost 25% of all the dietary ingredients used to formulate the feeds, but their relative contribution to gonad production only averaged 8.55 ± 0.58 and 3.80 ± 0.05%, respectively, among the diets. This indicates that, at least for gonad development, these ingredients may not be required at such high levels. These findings support previous data on the importance of Ulva in abalone and urchin diets, and demonstrate the value of stable isotope analysis for assessing the contribution of specific dietary ingredients in new feed formulations, particularly where growth of specific tissues is being investigated. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/anu.12979,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073963584

In this 91-d study we investigated the effects of feeding four diets containing graded levels of crude protein (CP; 27, 30, 33 and 36%) at three seasonal water temperatures (14, 17 and 20 °C) on the energy budget components for 6-month-old Greenlip Abalone, Haliotis laevigata, (0.91 g; 19.46 mm shell length). The increase of water temperature significantly increased individual energy budget components, rates for somatic growth energy, respiration energy and shell growth energy of abalone. Ammonia excretion energy rate was positively related to increasing dietary CP levels. In contrast, there were significant interactions between water temperature and dietary CP levels for ingested feed energy rate, absorbed energy rate and egested faecal energy rate. For energy budgets, respiration energy accounted for the largest proportion and ranged between 34.1 and 43.9% of the ingested feed energy. Somatic growth energy (16.80–28.10%) also accounted for a large proportion of the energy budget. Although egested faecal energy was lower, it still accounted for 8.2–17.9% of the ingested feed energy. In contrast, pedal mucus production energy (4.12–6.20%), ammonia excretion energy (0.28–1.40%) and shell growth energy (0.22–0.46%) accounted for relatively smaller proportions of ingested feed energy. Water temperature significantly impacted energy budgets more than dietary CP level. To maximise energy transfer to somatic growth, a water temperature of 20 °C is recommended for culturing Greenlip Abalone. Additionally, to minimise energy loss through faecal egestion, a dietary CP level of 36% is recommended for the diet of 6-month-old Greenlip Abalone at optimum water temperatures. However, the increase in ammonia excretion energy at high dietary CP should also be considered when managing water quality and waste production in abalone farms, especially where tank water exchange is limited. These findings provide a better understanding of the energy budgets for Greenlip Abalone, in relation to temperature and dietary protein levels, and will aid in the development of sustainable diets applicable to the three-four years of culture. © 2021",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.736499,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100809017
Zhang Y.; Jiao Y.; Li Z.; Tao Y.; Yang Y.,Hazards of phthalates (PAEs) exposure: A review of aquatic animal toxicology studies,2021,Science of the Total Environment,771,,,,145418,"Phthalates (PAEs) are of wide concern because they are commonly used in various plastic products as plasticizers, and can found their way into the environment. However, their interaction with the environment and their toxicity in aquatic animals is still a matter of intense debate. In this review on PAEs in aquatic environments (lakes, rivers and seas), it is found that there is a large variety and abundance of PAEs in developing countries, and the total concentration of PAEs even exceeds 200 μg / L. The interaction between metabolic processes involved in the toxicity induced by various PAEs is summarized for the first time in the article. Exposure of PAEs can lead to activation of the detoxification system CYP450 and endocrine system receptors of aquatic animals, which in turn causes oxidative stress, metabolic disorders, endocrine disorders, and immunosuppression. Meanwhile, each system can activate / inhibit each other, causing genotoxicity and cell apoptosis, resulting in the growth and development of organisms being blocked. The mixed PAEs shows no cumulative toxicity changes to aquatic animals. For the combined pollution of other chemicals and PAEs, PAE can act as an agonist or antagonist, leading to combined toxicity in different directions. Phthalate monoesters (MPEs), the metabolites of PAEs, are also toxic to aquatic animals, however, the toxicity is weaker than the corresponding parent compounds. This review summarizes and analyzes the current ecotoxicological effects of PAEs on aquatic animals, and provides guidance for future research. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145418,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100250325

Nine experimental diets in a 3 × 3 two-factor design were formulated with different carbohydrate levels (27.5%, 32% and 36.5%) and vitamin D3 levels (0, 1000 IU/kg and 5000 IU/kg). Results showed that the highest specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone was observed in the treatment with 36.5% of dietary carbohydrate and 1000 IU/kg of vitamin D3. The serum glucose, body crude lipid and muscle glycogen contents of abalone significantly increased with increasing dietary carbohydrate levels (P < 0.05). Diet with 1000 IU/kg of vitamin D3 significantly reduced the serum glucose and body crude lipid content (P < 0.05). Significant interactions between dietary carbohydrate and vitamin D3 were observed in SGR and crude lipid content (P < 0.05). Diet with 36.5% carbohydrate up-regulated the expression of pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate (IRS), protein kinase B (Akt), glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase (PYG), whereas decreased the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6P) and glycogen synthesis kinase-3β. Diet with 1000 IU/kg of vitamin D3 significantly up-regulated the hexokinase, IR, IRS, Akt and glucose transporter 1 mRNA levels, whereas decreased the G6PDH (P < 0.05). The interaction between dietary carbohydrate and vitamin D3 were significant on PEPCK, G6P, G6PDH and PYG mRNA levels (P < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary carbohydrates and vitamin D3 could affect glucose metabolism by regulating glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and pentose phosphate pathway in abalone. Besides, they triggered the insulin signaling pathway, and further influence glucose transport and glycogen synthesis, which could promote the utilization of carbohydrate in abalone. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.736908,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106269332

The tested S. intermedius was divided into two types: large-size (3 cm test diameter) and small-size (1 cm test diameter). Using the existing abalone breeding facilities, we regularly fed Laminaria japonica and Gracilaria lemaneiformis. After six months of breeding, the test diameter of large-size S. intermedius bred in Fuzhou had reached (55.90±2.63) mm, while the body mass had reached (56.30±6.92) g and the gonadal index reached (15.02±1.5)%. The gonadal development entered the stage of premature (Stage III) with good quality, which was significantly greater than the test diameter (46.56±3.88) mm and body mass (39.07±5.05) g for S. intermedius bred in Dalian in the same period (P<0.05). Besides, the test diameter of small-size S. intermedius in Fuzhou had reached (40.97±0.87) mm, while the body mass had reached (23.18±0.37) g and the gonadal index had reached (9.64±1.00)%. Thus, it is suggested that seasonally breeding S. intermedius in the coastal areas of Fujian Province in winter and spring is feasible. Feeding with local fresh algae on basis of existing facilities and abalone cages leads to higer growth rate of S. intermedius than those bred in Dalian in the same period. The important way to meet the increasing market demand of S. intermedius is to move the breeding southward along Fujian coast. © 2020 Editorial Office of South China Fisheries Science.

This study fabricated CHA based on abalone mussel shells (Halioitis asinina); CHA/paraffin wax nanocomposite scaffolds were synthesized using paraffin wax with concentration variations of 10, 20, and 30 wt.%. The energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDS) results showed that the Ca/P molar ratio of CHA was 1.72, which approaches the natural bone. The addition of paraffin wax in all concentration variation treatments caused the crystallographic properties of the CHA/paraffin wax nanocomposite scaffolds to decrease. The results of pore analysis suggest that the high concentration of paraffin wax in the CHA suspension is involved in the formation of more pores on the surface of the scaffold, but only CHA/paraffin wax 30 wt.% had a scaffold with potential to be used in media with a cellular growth orientation. The micropore analysis was also supported by the cell viability assay results for CHA/paraffin wax 30 wt.% nanocomposite scaffold, where serial doses of scaffold concentrations to mouse osteoblast cells were secure. Overall, based on this analysis, the CHA/paraffin wax scaffold can be a candidate for bone tissue engineering. © 2021 by the authors.

Aiming at environmental and resource sustainability, porous microspheres of carbonate-substituted hydroxyapatite (HAP) were prepared by a hydrothermal method using abalone shells; then, they were further used as a carrier for doxorubicin (DOX) in a drug delivery system. The porous HAP microspheres were approximately 6 μm in size with a considerable specific surface area and average pore size (128.6659 cm2/g and 9.064 nm, respectively), which ensured excellent drug-handling capacity (95.542%). In addition, the pH responsiveness of the drug release system was favorable for effective in vivo drug release in an acidic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the drug-loaded microspheres could effectively induce apoptosis of MCF-7 cells but were less cytotoxic to MC3T3-E1 cells. Because of its good biocompatibility, high drug loading capacity and controlled drug release property, the porous microspheres prepared in this experiment have potential application value in drug delivery and tumor therapy; furthermore, they make full use of abalone shells, providing environmental sustainability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.msec.2020.110969,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083488095

However, the slow growth of abalone species impedes the health development of the abalone farming industry. In this study, the genome-wide association study (GWAS) for the growth related traits in Pacific abalone was performed. Genetic parameters of 10 growth-related traits in 222 individuals of the Pacific abalone were estimated by using 1,431,014 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected by whole genome resequencing (WGS). A total of 263 significant SNPs associated with growth traits were identified. Seven of these SNPs were further shown to be reliable growth-associated markers in a new validation population containing 1059 samples. In addition, 62 genes, including fgfr2, bmp7, cubn, rala, gpam, and adamts9, harboring significant markers were considered candidate genes, which may affect growth-related traits associated with various biological processes, such as cell proliferation, glycometabolism, and lipid metabolism. Our results will not only improve our understanding of the genetic architecture of abalone growth traits but also provide valuable SNPs for the marker-assisted selection and breeding of the Pacific abalone. © 2021",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.736820,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105287267

In California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico), overfishing and climate change-linked diseases are thought to be responsible for mass mortalities and significant declines in abalone fisheries landings. Conservation aquaculture is an option for enhancing abalone populations through captive propagation and cage mariculture with subsequent restockings into the wild. To test, inform, and promote innovative sustainable seafood production strategies in the Northeastern Pacific, we designed an experimental mariculture system at San Jeronimo Island, Baja California. We explored the feasibility of rearing juvenile red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, in a near-shore mariculture cage-based production system to supply individuals for local restoration programs. We tested the effects of 2 different depths, surface and bottom (5 m), and 3 macroalgal diets (Macrocystis pyrifera, Eisenia arborea, and a mixed diet of Pelagophycus porra with M. pyrifera) on the survival and growth of juvenile red abalone (32 ± 3.33 mm in shell length) inside cages attached to a long-line system. Over the 90-d experiment, survival was 99% for the surface treatment and 95% for the bottom treatment. Mean daily increment in shell length was 93 ± 12 µm·d–1 in surface cages and 82 ± 13 µm·d–1 in bottom cages. Depth did not affect growth or survival. Growth was highest using the E. arborea diet (99 ± 7 µm·d–1) but not significantly different from the M. pyrifera and mixed diets (88 ± 10 and 74 ± 13 µm·d–1, respectively).

Gut microbiota plays critical roles in the physiological functions of aquatic animals, and it is influenced by numerous factors. Previous studies about the gut microbiota of abalone usually focused on analyzing bacterial taxonomy or the impact of a single abiotic factor. However, the effect of abiotic factors, combined with biotic factors (i.e., genotype), on gut microbiota of abalone has not been systematically explored. In China, the hybrid Haliotis discus hannai♀ × H. fulgens♂ has potential for large-scale farming in southern China by its fast growth rate and tolerance to higher temperature. In this study, we analyzed the effects of diet, temperature and genotypes on gut microbiota of abalones using 16S rRNA gene sequencing data. The experiments indicate that the top three dominant genera keep consistent across various temperatures, diets and genotypes. The α-diversity of the microbial community was affected by temperature, genotype and diet. On the whole, the α-diversity of the gut microbiota of H. discus hannai was higher than that of the hybrid under the same temperature or diet. For β-diversity, the microbial samples exhibited clear groups under abiotic gradients of temperature and diet. Some of the identified temperature-specific and diet-specific OTUs and KEGG Orthologs are related with degradation of carrageenan, laminaran and agar; metabolism of carbohydrate; biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and antibiotics, etc. According to permutational multivariate ANOVA, temperature and diet could explain almost 52% of bacterial structure variation. The gut microbiota of the two abalone genotypes have different responses to environmental gradients of temperature and diet. The gut microbiota of H. discus hannai is more sensitive to temperature, while the hybrid is more sensitive to diet, which might be the potential explanation of its tolerance to higher temperature in breeding. This study makes the first attempt to correlate the structural variation of gut microbiota in abalone by considering both abiotic and biotic factors. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735269,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082425676
Matsumoto Y.; Yatsuya K.,Fenton reaction as a possible stimulus to induce spawning in Ezo abalone Haliotis discus hannai during stormy weather,2021,Marine Ecology Progress Series,669,,241,246,,"Synchronous spawning is an important behavior which increases fertilization success of invertebrates with external fertilization. Previous work has shown that free radicals can induce spawning behavior in tank experiments, but the stimulus for spawning in the wild is not fully understood. Ezo abalone Haliotis discus hannai mainly spawn during stormy weather. Rainwater contains H2O2 and iron (II) ions (Fe2+). We propose that during stormy weather, water layers in the ocean are mixed and the surface layer containing H2O2 and Fe2+ interacts with the ocean bottom; this leads to conditions suitable for the occurrence of the Fenton reaction (wherein Fe2+ ions are oxidized to iron [III] ions by H2O2, and ·OH and hydroxide ions are generated). Hydroxyl radicals (·OH) are generated during the oxidization of Fe2+ by H2O2, and we hypothesized that these induce spawning behavior of abalone in the wild. We observed that H. discus hannai released eggs after salinity decreased as a result of rainfall during stormy conditions. In addition, a tank experiment demonstrated that ·OH generated by the Fenton reaction induced synchronous spawning behavior between the sexes. This study provides a new hypothesis about control of synchronous spawning in H. discus hannai, and the results might be applicable to other invertebrates. © Inter-Research 2021.",10.3354/meps13742,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149451810
Nuurai P.; Wanichanon C.; Wanichanon R.,"Effect of gonadotropin releasing hormone on the expression of luteinizing hormone and estrogen in the nerve ganglia and ovary of a tropical abalone, Haliotis asinina Linnaeus",2020,Acta Histochemica,122,1,,,151454,"Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) is a peptide brain hormone that is involved in the regulation of reproduction in vertebrates via stimulation of the secretion of the pituitary hormones, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which in their turn stimulate sexual development and sex steroid hormone secretion by the gonads. The tropical abalone, Haliotis asinina, in common with many other invertebrates contains a peptide with a similar structure to GnRH. This study looks at its possible involvement in reproduction by injecting groups of one-year-old female abalone at the mature phase by injecting them with synthetic H. asinina (Has) GnRH at doses of 0, 250 and 500 ng/g and then measuring the amount of material in nerve ganglia, ovary and hemolymph that cross-reacted with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for vertebrate LH and steroid, estradiol. Immunohistochemistry, using antibodies for the same two compounds, was also carried out to examine the location of immunoactivity in the tissues of the animals. There were slight (in some cases statistically significant) increases in LH-immunoactivity and estradiol in the hemolymph and tissues. However, this applied to the lower dose only (i.e the dose-response relationship was non-monotonic). Using immunohistochemistry, LH-immunoreactive cells were observed in types 1 and 2 neurosecretory (NS1 and NS2) cells within the cerebral and pleuropedal ganglia of H. asinina. In addition, LH-immunoreactive nerve fiber bundles were strongly detected in both ganglia. The immunoactivity against the estrogen appeared to be localized in the granulated cells within the connective tissue and trabeculae of the mature ovary. There was no positive staining in the cytoplasm of any stage of the germ cells. The interpretation of these findings is presently hindered by the fact that the homologous gene for vertebrate LH has not yet been identified in the genomes of any mollusks (so the cause of the immunostaining is as yet unknown) and also by the fact that mollusks are known to readily absorb steroids from the environment and store them long-term in the form of fatty acid esters. More work, involving identification of the protein that cross-reacts with the LH antiserum and also exclusion of the possibility that the estradiol is of exogenous origin, will have to be carried out before these findings can be used to manipulate reproduction in this species. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH",10.1016/j.acthis.2019.151454,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073032135

Seven semi-purified diets with graded levels of AA (0, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 5000 mg/kg) were fed to abalone (initial weight: 12.01 ± 0.001 g, initial shell length: 48.44 ± 0.069 mm) for 100 days. The survival, weight gain rate and daily increment in shell length were not affected by dietary AA. The AA content in the gill, muscle and digestive glands of abalone was significantly increased by dietary AA. In terms of immunity, dietary AA significantly improved the total hemocyte count, respira-tory burst and phagocytic activity in hemolymph, and lysozyme activity in cell-free hemolymph (CFH). In the digestive gland, the TLR-MyD88-dependent and TLR-MyD88-independent signaling pathways were suppressed by dietary AA supplementation. The mRNA levels of β-defensin and arginase-I in the digestive gland were significantly increased by dietary AA. In the gill, only the TLR-MyD88-dependent signaling pathway was depressed by dietary AA to reduce inflammation in abalone. The level of mytimacin 6 in the gill was significantly upregulated by dietary AA. After Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection, the TLR signaling pathway in the digestive gland was suppressed by dietary AA, which reduced inflammation in the abalone. In terms of anti-oxidation, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities, as well as total anti-oxidative capacity and reduced glutathione content in CFH, were all significantly upregulated. The malondialdehyde content was significantly downregulated by dietary AA. The anti-oxidative capacity was improved by triggering the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway in abalone. In terms of apoptosis, dietary AA could enhance the anti-apoptosis ability via the JNK-Bcl-2/Bax signaling cascade in abalone. To conclude, dietary AA was involved in regulating immunity, anti-oxidation and apoptosis in abalone. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we characterized HIF-1α in Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), an aquaculture-relevant mollusk species, and its transcriptional regulation patterns in response to oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent stimuli were investigated. The molecular cloning and sequence analysis revealed that the abalone HIF-1α shared conversed features in its domain organization such as basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) domain, Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain, oxygen-dependent degradation domains (ODDDs), and C-terminal transactivation domain (C-TAD) with metazoan orthologs. The abalone HIF-1α was proven to be transcriptionally active in multiple tissues according to dissolved oxygen contents, with the most sensitive responsiveness in the gill. Under non-hypoxic conditions, the tissue-dependent transcriptional regulation patterns of the abalone HIF-1α were closely correlated and intertwined with those of HSP90 and MT in response to thermal challenge and heavy metal exposure, respectively. The abalone HIF-1α expression was significantly modulated under normoxic conditions in response to immune challenges with lipopolysaccharide and Vibrio harveyi with the highest upregulation in the hemocytes. However, the combined treatment of hypoxia and immune stimulation exhibited no synergistic activation for the induction of HIF-1α mRNA. Collectively, dynamic transcriptional regulation of the abalone HIF-1α with the tissue specificity in response to oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent stimulatory challenges suggests that HIF-1α plays crucial roles in interdependent crosstalk between hypoxia, innate immunity, and environmental stresses, which can be a useful basis to investigate cellular and physiological responses of farmed abalones to oxygen depletion and other-related stress factors. © 2020 The Authors",10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.100566,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098225172

Loeher M.M.; Moore J.D.,Foot injury survival in red abalone (Haliotis rufescens),2020,Aquaculture,529,,,,735734,"Recovery of the U. S. Federal Endangered Species Act-listed white abalone (Haliotis sorenseni) in California, USA depends on the success of a captive breeding program, which requires collection of wild broodstock to maintain genetic diversity. Foot damage is frequently sustained during collection and handling, and severe injuries can be fatal. This study used the proxy species red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) to investigate the ability of abalone to survive foot injury by administering foot injuries varying in severity and monitoring subsequent health and survival. In a preliminary study, 6/6 farm-origin 55–70 mm animals survived two types of injury while 5/6 survived a third type of injury. We then conducted a definitive study using 24 wild-origin animals (165–207 mm) and three intensified injury treatments. Five of six animals that received a deep tissue incision were dead the following morning, presumably from acute hemolymph loss, and the remaining animal in that treatment group died on day 41 with a systemic bacterial infection. Nine of twelve abalone that received loss of either 8% or 17% of foot sole epithelium survived until experiment termination at day 90, at which time all survivors were regenerating epithelial tissues, as evident by histology. This study suggests that abalone may be more capable of surviving significant superficial foot damage that can occur during collection and handling, at least in a captive rearing environment, than has been previously recognized. © 2020",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735734,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088362742
Jones T.L.; Coltrain J.B.; Jacobs D.K.; Porcasi J.; Brewer S.C.; Buckner J.C.; Perrine J.D.; Codding B.F.,Causes and consequences of the late Holocene extinction of the marine flightless duck (Chendytes lawi) in the northeastern Pacific,2021,Quaternary Science Reviews,260,,,,106914,"The extinction of California's flightless duck, Chendytes lawi, stands out in the faunal history of North America because it involved a marine animal that disappeared in the late Holocene, not in the terminal Pleistocene when humans arrived from Asia, nor with the more recent entry of Europeans and associated resource exploitation. Here we evaluate the duck's ecology by combining a stable isotopic evaluation of its feeding niche with records of human predation and climatic variation to evaluate (1) alternative influences on the duck's extinction and (2) possible ecological consequences of its disappearance. Results indicate that a mid-late Holocene increase in human population density coincided with a decrease in mean sea surface temperatures (SST) and an increase in SST variance, all of which were contemporaneous with the demise of the flightless duck ca. 2500 cal BP. Climate appears to be a main exogenous driver of this extinction event by not only negatively impacting flightless duck food availability, but positively impacting one of the duck's main predators: humans. Isotopic findings indicate the duck had a unique feeding ecology that overlapped equally with analog species reliant mostly on marine invertebrates (sea otters [Enhydra lutris]) and on fish (harbor seals [Phoca vitulina]). This dietary niche overlap suggests the duck's extinction could have opened foraging opportunities for harbor seals and sea otters. Otter numbers appear to have increased coincident with the duck's decline which also correlates with a decrease in size and abundance of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens), one of the otter's preferred prey. These correlations suggest that new feeding opportunities may have emerged for otters in the face of the duck's extinction, encouraging an increase in otter populations, which then had negative impacts on abalone that also were targeted by humans. Overall findings suggest the possibility of an unanticipated prehistoric precursor to the historic baseline of this nearshore ecosystem. © 2021 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.quascirev.2021.106914,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103926890

During the day, abalones take shelter under rocks or in crevices from which they emerge to forage in the evening. In this study, we explored the effect of changing seawater temperature on the foraging and hiding behaviors of the juvenile Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai. First, we tested whether their hiding behavior in response to light differs depending on the temperature (11°C, 14°C, and 17°C) when only artificial shelter was provided. We observed that the abalones hid under the shelter much faster at 17°C than at 11°C. Second, we tested whether their hiding and foraging behaviors changed in response to increasing temperature when both food and shelter were provided. At high water temperature (17°C), abalones emerged more quickly than at low water temperature (11°C), and the total number of feeding abalones was higher at high temperature than that at low temperature. However, the hiding speed in response to light in the morning was not significantly different among different temperatures. These results suggest that although the basic response to a single stimulus (i.e., light or food) was faster at higher temperatures than at lower temperatures, abalones may increase their boldness under higher temperatures when deciding whether to feed or hide. © 2020, KSO, KIOST and Springer.",10.1007/s12601-020-0024-8,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089755506
Gao X.; Pang G.; Luo X.; You W.; Ke C.,Effects of stocking density on the survival and growth of Haliotis discus hannai ♀ × H. fulgens♂ hybrids,2020,Aquaculture,529,,,,735693,"In order to examine the effects of different stocking densities and culture methods on the growth, food intake and expression of related genes in Haliotis discus hannai ♀ × H. fulgens♂ hybrid abalones, juvenile abalones were placed into three treatment groups of different stocking densities (400, 600, 800 ind/m2) and cultured using two different methods, including suspension cages and bottom sowing. There were three replicates of each experimental group (stocking density and culture method) and the experiment lasted for 180 days. The results showed that the survival rate, specific growth rate of shell length and body weight, food intake and feed conversion efficiency of the abalones cultured in suspension cages were significantly lower than those in the bottom sown group. For abalones cultured by bottom sowing, there was no significant difference between the specific growth rate of shell length and body weight, feed conversion efficiency, α-amylase, cellulase activity and the expression levels of Hdlam on each sampling occasion for the 400 and 600 ind/m2 treatments. However, these parameters were significantly higher in both the 400 and 600 ind/m2 treatments compared with the 800 ind/m2 treatment. When the stocking density was increased to 800 ind/m2, the food intake and the expression levels of Hdaly, Hdcel, Hdamyl of the abalones cultured in both culture methods were significantly lower than the 400 and 600 ind/m2 treatments. This indicates that even with sufficient food supply, some abalones were unable to capture food due to the constraints of the culture space and the feeding method used by abalones, resulting in reduced growth. The findings of this research suggest that the growth and food intake of abalones can be promoted and production can be improved at a stocking density of 600 ind/m2. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735693,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088128320

The aim of the present study was to improve the sperm cryopreservation technique for this valuable species using an antifreeze protein III (AFPIII). Post-thaw sperm quality parameters including mo-tility, acrosome integrity (AI), plasma membrane integrity (PMI), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), DNA integrity, fertility, hatchability, and mRNA abundance level of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) were determined to ensure improvement of the cryopreservation technique. Post-thaw motility of sperm cryopreserved with AFPIII at 10 µg/mL combined with 8% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (61.3 ± 2.7%), 8% ethylene glycol (EG) (54.3 ± 3.3%), 6% propylene glycol (PG) (36.6 ± 2.6%), or 2% glycerol (GLY) (51.7 ± 3.0%) was significantly improved than that of sperm cryopreserved without AFPIII. Post-thaw motility of sperm cryopreserved with 2% MeOH and 1 µg/mL of AFPIII was also improved than that of sperm cryopreserved without AFPIII. A combination of 10 µg/mL AFPIII with 8% DMSO resulted in the highest post-thaw motility, showing AI of 60.1 ± 3.9%, PMI of 67.2 ± 4.0%, and MMP of 59.1 ± 4.3%. DNA integrity of sperm cryopreserved using 10 µg/mL AFPIII combined with 8% DMSO was not significantly (p > 0.05) different from that of fresh sperm. Cryopreservation using a combination of AFPIII with 8% DMSO improved fertilization and hatching rates of sperm compared to that of cryopreservation without supplementation of 10 µg/mL AFPIII. Sperm cryopreserved using AFPIII showed higher mRNA abundance levels of HSP90 than those cryopreserved without AFPIII. Results of the present study suggest that 10 µg/mL AFPIII combined with 8% DMSO can be used for large scale cryopreservation of Pacific abalone sperm and for hatchery production. © 2021 by the authors.

Development of strategies to enhance disease resistance during grow out would greatly reduce stock mortality and boost production yields. In this study, New Zealand black-footed abalone (Haliotis iris) were fed a commercial diet enhanced with multi-strain probiotics (Exiguobacterium JHEb1, Vibrio JH1 and Enterococcus JHLDc) for four months, then challenged with an injection of pathogenic Vibrio splendidus. Host immune responses in haemocytes were characterized using flow cytometry by measuring total haemocyte counts (THC) and viability, degree of apoptosis, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 48 h post-challenge. Probiotic-fed abalone had significantly higher survival rates compared to control animals after the bacterial challenge. Infected probiotic-fed abalone also had significantly higher haemocyte viabilities, slightly lower proportions of haemocytes undergoing early apoptosis, and lower proportions of ROS-producing haemocytes compared to infected control-fed abalone. In addition, metabolite profiles of muscle tissues generated via gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) delivered complimentary evidence to support a perturbed ROS-regulatory system in infected abalone through changes in key metabolites associated with glutathione biosynthesis. The results of this study provide valuable information to assist in farm management practices, leading to enhance production and sustainability of the New Zealand abalone aquaculture industry. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.fsi.2020.06.007,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087982753

Notwithstanding the upturn, their conventional synthesis at extremely high temperatures yielding limiting compositions stands in the way of achieving a paradigm shift in gCN fabrication. With the ultimate goal of surpassing these hurdles, we utilize N-doped carbon nanosheets (N-CNS) as a filler in free-radical-mediated aqueous copolymerization. By dispersing N-CNS in a polymer matrix, high-performance mechanically robust composites could be developed and tailored to individual applications. As-synthesized hydrogel nanocomposite systems are used to decode the balance for emulating evolutionary accomplishments of nature's nanocomposites like the ""abalone's nacre"". At a lower concentration (0.05%), N-CNS disperse homogeneously and interact intimately with the polymer matrix forming an ""interphase""zone around individual nanofillers dramatically affecting the mobility of polymer chains to yield sheet architectures. On increasing the filler concentration (0.3%), the intercalation phenomenon gets perturbed due to an intrinsically oriented aggregation of nanofiller giving rise to a surge in entropy that leads to conspicuous buckling and tubular aggregates. At the interfacial regime, the poly(acrylic acid) domains come in closer proximity to the hydrophobic cages of N-CNS, and a nanoconfinement effect exerts high pressure manifesting acid-catalyzed condensation of melamine units to form, for the first time, quasi-two-dimensional heptazine-gCN (h-gCN) within hydrogel nanocomposites. Polymer properties are enhanced by the addition of N-CNS through complex interfacial interactions and the unique distributions of internanofiller distances. Endowed with mechanical properties that closely mimic natural skin and combined with the repurposed drug ""losartan"", these hydrogel nanocomposites offer scarless healing of second-degree burns.  © 2020 American Chemical Society",10.1021/acsapm.0c01020,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097947688
Kuehl L.M.; Donovan D.A.,"Survival, growth, and radula morphology of Haliotis kamtschatkana postlarvae fed six species of benthic diatoms",2021,Aquaculture,533,,,,736136,"Haliotis kamtschatkana is the only abalone native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. Haliotis kamtschatkana populations are in decline, and current restoration efforts in Washington State rely on out-planting hatchery-produced juveniles. Hatchery personnel report highest mortalities in the postlarval stage of H. kamtschatkana, mainly during the first 3 to 6 months. Postlarvae feed on films of benthic diatoms, and the purpose of this study was to test six diatom species (Achnanthes brevipes, Amphora salina, Amphiprora paludosa, Cylindrotheca closterium, Navicula incerta, and Nitzschia laevis) as suitable diets for H. kamtschatkana. Diatom diet suitability might rely on several factors, including diatom characteristics as well as the postlarva's ability to ingest the diatoms. The radula is a crucial feeding structure for gastropods and may display morphological plasticity, but this has never been characterized in H. kamtschatkana. We investigated survival, growth, and radula morphology of H. kamtschatkana postlarvae when fed one of six benthic diatom species for 61 days post-settlement. Amphora salina yielded the highest survival, in a statistically homogenous subgroup with N. incerta, A. paludosa, and C. closterium. Achnanthes brevipes yielded exceptionally low survival, on par with a starvation control. Cylindrotheca closterium yielded significantly better growth than all other diets except A. salina. Radula development was similar to that of other abalone species. The shape and size of the radula did not explain success or failure of any of the diatom diets since the radula morphology of H. kamtschatkana was comparable to other abalone that have succeeded when fed these same diets. We found no relationship between diatom diet and radula morphology. We recommend A. salina as a suitable diet for newly settled H. kamtschatkana postlarvae, and that a combination of A. salina and C. closterium be used to supplement feeding on naturally occurring biofilms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.736136,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096127834

Susanlimocotyle n. gen. is characterized by species possessing: an intestinal ceca confluent posteriorly; a male copulatory organ, comprising a variable tube, articulated with the accessory piece; a sclerotized vagina, vaginal aperture dextro-ventral; an onchium; a robust ventral bar; two dorsal bars; a ventral anchor with elongated shaft and a dorsal anchor with deep root expanding into wings. In addition, new molecular data of Chauhanellus spp. are also provided and used for the evaluation of the phylogenetic relationships among monogenoids parasitizing siluriforms. Susanlimocotyle n. gen. exhibited a higher genetic divergence level for 18S rDNA (4.6 to 7.2% [83–130 bp]) with respect to Chauhanellus spp. despite sharing S. herzbergii as a host, than Hamatopeduncularia spp., (4.1 to 5.8% [75–110 bp]) from Oriental ariids. For the 18S rDNA, 5.8S rDNA, ITS1 and ITS2 regions, C. boegeri and C. susamlimae were observed to have the smallest interspecific distances, and C. velum was revealed to be the most genetically distant species to Chauhanellus. The proposal for Susanlimocotyle n. gen. is also supported by phylogenetic analysis based on the 18S rDNA gene, which supports the close relationship between the new genus and Hamatopeduncularia and Chauhanellus from ariids from the South America and Oriental regions. Moreover, the patterns towards the shared diversification between monogenoids and their ariid hosts were addressed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.parint.2020.102271,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098110029

In this study, we examined the protection of selenium (Se)-enriched G. lemaneiformis against cadmium (Cd) toxicity in the abalone, Haliotis discus hannai, using various indices including metal concentration (Se and Cd), growth rate, GPx enzymatic antioxidants, and metallothionein (MT) concentration over a period of 28 days of exposure. The growth rates and Se contents increased significantly in abalones fed with Se-enriched G. lemaneiformis, while the toxicity of Cd was reduced. Seven to 12 days Cd exposure to the Se-enriched G. lemaneiformis not only affected GPx activity but the MT levels fluctuated irregularly. MT concentrations increased after 3 days exposure and then gradually decreased to the control level after Day 7. There were statistically significant positive correlations between MT levels, GPx activity and Se concentrations, and negative relationships between MT levels, GPx activity and Cd levels in abalones. These findings suggest that Se-enriched Gracilaria protects abalone against Cd toxicity. The possible mechanism is the induction of MT with a concomitant increased capacity of GPx enzymatic antioxidants. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.12.105,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059579357

As abalone is herbivorous, the use of local collected algae as feed may appear advantageous. The nutritional value of eight monospecific seaweed diets was studied using Palmaria palmata (Rhodophyta), filamentous algae, mainly Gracilaria sp. (Rhodophyta), Enteromorpha sp. and Ulva lactuca (Chlorophyta), together with Saccharina latissima, Saccorhiza polyschides, Laminaria digitata and Laminaria hyperborea (Ochrophyta, Phaeophyceae) and a mixed macroalgal diet. An integrative approach consisted in monitoring the seasonal composition changes of these algae in terms of protein, lipid, soluble carbohydrate, fatty acid and amino-acid contents, and to relate it to seasonal growth and reproduction investment during a large-scale experiment. Abalone and algae were studied for one year in commercial sea-cage structures. Abalone fed with monospecific diet using either P. palmata or S. latissima, and with mixed diet presented the best growth rate, muscle ratio and gonad development. Seasonal daily weight gain was mainly associated with n-3/n-6 ratio, soluble carbohydrate content and total protein content. In term of amino-acid contents, the daily weight gain was associated with free phenylalanine as well as isoleucine levels. Moreover, 90% of 2-years old abalone started gonad development but less than a quarter featured a fully matured gonad. The gonad development of H. tuberculata was mostly associated to total valine, methionine, leucine, arginine and isoleucine levels. The age of initial sexual maturity in H. tuberculata turned to be a highly plastic trait in response to different growth rates and algal diets. Even if P. palmata is the best option for growth performance, mixed diets should probably be preferred to a monospecific diet in order to avoid too high pressure on a single algal resource. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.734385,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070622642

Takami H.; Kawamura T.,Ontogenetic habitat shift in abalone Haliotis discus hannai: a review,2018,Fisheries Science,84,2,189,200,,"Ecological literature on abalone Haliotis discus hannai populations is reviewed to identify processes and factors driving ontogenetic shifts in habitat. Abalone recruitment is related to the algal community type, with abalone shifting with growth from deeper crustose coralline algal (CCA) habitats to shallower kelp bed habitats via algal turfs. Timing of the habitat shifts is linked to ontogenetic changes in diet, from benthic diatoms to a diet dominated by macroalgae. Susceptibility to predation appears to change, concomitant with the shift from cryptic microhabitats during early-life stages to more exposed habitats during latter-life stages. Interstitial spaces between cobbles and boulders in the CCA habitat are considered to be important for reducing predation risk. The loss of CCA nursery habitat through sedimentation and macroalgal overgrowth likely negatively affects abalone recruitment. Preservation of diverse algal communities, including suitable habitats for the different abalone growth stages, is critical for successful abalone recruitment. © 2018, Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.",10.1007/s12562-017-1169-y,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041904499

It contains rich proteins and various biologically active substances. However, the abalone viscera are often abandoned when processing or during consumption of abalone. This is not only a great waste, but also causes pollution to the environment. In recent years, with the exploration and research of marine active substances, abalone viscera have also been studied and developed. Intestinal microorganisms are known as ""external organs"" of the host, they are directly involved in the host's nutrition, immunity, metabolism, and so on. They play important roles in maintaining the health of the host. A few studies have reported the in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activity of abalone polysaccharides and polypeptides; however, the effects of abalone active substances on the intestinal microorganism have not been previously reported. In this paper, the intestinal microbiota of tilapia and the influence of feeding abalone visceral crude polysaccharide (CAVP) on the intestinal microbiota were studied by PCR-DGGE and Illumina MiSeq sequencing. A total of 13 bacterial phyla were detected in the intestines of tilapia: Fusobacteria (77.84%) was the dominant phylum, Bacteroidetes (8.59%), Chlamydiae (6.18%), Proteobacteria (5.84%), and Actinobacteria (1.20%) were the subdominant phyla. Saccharibacteria, Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, TM6_Dependentiae, Cyanobacteria, Spirochaetae, Acidobacteria, and some unknown groups were also detected. At the genus level, Cetobacterium (77.84%) was the dominant genus, Neochlamydia (5.80%), Plesiomonas (2.64%), and Acinetobacter (1.13%) were the subdominant genera. There was also an unknown genus of the family Porphyromonadaceae, accounting for 8.29%. In addition, Mycobacterium, Alsobacter, Aquicella, Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, Alpinimonas, and some unknown genera were also detected. The addition of CAVP diet had an obvious influence on the intestinal microbiota of tilapia because the CAVP-treated samples and the control samples without CAVP clustered separately. After feeding CAVP, the abundance of Actinobacteria, Saccharibacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and TM6_Dependentiae decreased significantly (P<0.05). At the genus level, the abundance of Plesiomonas and Cetobacterium was up-regulated, whereas the Neochlamydia, Acinetobacter, Mycobacterium, Alsobacter, Aquicella, Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, and Alpinimonas decreased, of which the abundance of Mycobacterium, Alsobacter, Aquicella, and Plesiomonas decreased significantly compared with that of the control (P<0.05). After feeding CAVP, the abundance of some pathogens, such as Mycobacterium abscessus, Acinetobabacter baumannii, Aeromonas sharmana, Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, in which the Mycobacterium abscessus and Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens decreased significantly compared with that of the control (P<0.05). On the other hand, the probiotic bacteria, such as Cetobacterium, increased. This study investigated the effects of CAVP on the host with regard to intestinal microbes; it provides insight into the efficient evaluation of marine active substances, and also lays a theoretical foundation for the development and utilization of bioactive substances and the development of prebiotics from abalone viscera.

The structural control performance of the present bio-inspired base isolation system is demonstrated with numerical simulations using both a single-degree-of-freedom model and a multi-degree-of-freedom model under six different samples of earthquake excitations. A comparative study with three other types of existing base isolators reveals that the present bio-inspired tuned mass damper inerter isolation system may be relatively more effective in reducing the displacement, acceleration, input energy ratio and base shear force for the illustrative cases. In addition, a parametric study is performed to explore the effectiveness of the parameters chosen for the structure. The results illustrate that satisfactory target responses can be achieved for the examples studied by optimizing the parameters such as maximum bio-inspired force, damping coefficient, stiffness, and inertance of inerter. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.",10.1088/1361-665X/ab3239,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074783446

Euryhaliotrema luisae n. sp. ex C. brachysomus is differentiated from other congeneric species by the morphology of the male copulatory organ, which comprises a coil of nine counterclockwise rings, and by the morphology of the anchors and bars. Euryhaliotrema magnopharyngis n. sp. ex C. brachysomus can be distinguished from all other congeners by having a well-developed pharynx occupying much of the anterior region and by the ventral bar, which is V-shaped, with well-elongated, thin arms. In addition, E. luisae n. sp. and E. magnopharyngis n. sp. can be differentiated from all other members of Euryhaliotrema Kritsky & Boeger, 2002 by the presence of a glandular oval plate lying on peduncle. Haliotrema diplotaenia n. sp. ex B. diplotaenia is characterized by the structure of the male copulatory organ, comprising a tapered-shaped cirrus tube with twisted acute tip and a filament-shaped accessory piece with medial and distal expansions, and by the morphology of the ventral bar (inverted W-shaped, with short lateral ends and two anterior conical protuberances). Haliotrema saezae n. sp. ex B. diplotaenia differs from all other members of Haliotrema Johnston & Tiegs, 1922 by having a tubular copulatory organ with curved distal tip and a filament-shaped accessory piece without lateral expansions, and by the morphology of anchors and bars. The present findings are added to the other six marine dactylogyrids previously reported from Peru. © Springer Nature B.V. 2018.",10.1007/s11230-018-9827-8,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054606199
Goosen N.J.; De Wet L.F.; Görgens J.F.,Effects of formic acid in abalone diets that contain ingredients derived from fish processing by-products,2018,Aquaculture International,26,3,857,868,,"The study aimed to investigate the effects of formic acid inclusion in abalone diets, which contained ingredients produced from fish processing by-products, and to quantify effects on production performance. Four diets (a commercial reference and iso-nutrient diets containing fish silage oil, unprocessed rainbow trout viscera or shrimp protein hydrolysate) were evaluated both with and without addition of 2 g kg−1 dietary formic acid, thus yielding a total of eight treatments, in feeding trials with cultured South African abalone Haliotis midae. Results indicated that inclusion of unprocessed rainbow trout viscera without formic acid decreased production performance of experimental animals, as evidenced by significantly decreased final animal weight and daily weight gain, and significantly increased feed conversion ratio compared to the iso-nutrient control. The decreased production performance was attributed to decreased feed water stability of the diet incorporating untreated trout viscera. Dietary formic acid supplementation partially mitigated the negative impacts of viscera inclusion on production performance of the experimental animals, as seen in significantly higher final animal weight and daily weight gain, and lower feed conversion ratio when compared to non-formic acid-supplemented, viscera-containing diet. However, no beneficial effects on production performance or water stability were found upon formic acid inclusion in diets not containing trout viscera. In conclusion, dietary formic acid can partially mitigate negative impacts on production performance when unprocessed trout viscera are included in formulated abalone diets by improving feed water stability, but the exact mechanism by which this is achieved was not established. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10499-018-0257-z,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046894667

Four formulated diets were produced to contain 0.00 g/kg, 0.40 g/kg, 0.80 g/kg and 1.60 g/kg Actigen®, with functional ingredients of MOS, respectively. Accordingly, the experimental diets were named as A0, A4, A8 and A16. After 120-days feeding trial, the best growth performance was observed in A8 group (P < 0.05) and there was no significant difference in A0, A4 and A16 groups. With the increase of dietary MOS, the activity of the total antioxidant capacity in hepatopancreas is increasingly elevated (P < 0.05) while no significant difference was observed on activity of glutathione S‐transferase (P > 0.05). The activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were firstly increased and then decreased, with the highest values in A8 group (P < 0.05). Immune-related parameters were significantly affected by dietary MOS inclusion. Specifically, the activities of alkaline phosphatase and acid phosphatase in hepatopancreas and serum of abalone fed diets containing MOS were significantly higher than those of control A0 group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the highest values of both enzymes were observed in hepatopancreas of A8 group but in serum of A16 group, respectively. The lysozyme activities in hepatopancreas and serum of A4 group were significantly higher than those of other groups (P < 0.05) and there was no significant difference in A0, A8 and A16 groups (P > 0.05). The activities of cytophagy and respiratory burst in serum of abalone were not significantly affected by dietary MOS content (P > 0.05). The mRNA levels of focal adhesion kinase and integrin-linked kinase were gradually elevated with the increase of dietary MOS, with the highest value recorded in A16 group (P < 0.05). The gene expression of caspse-3 in A8 group was dramatically higher than those of other groups (P < 0.05) and there was no significant difference in A0, A4 and A16 groups (P > 0.05). The mRNA level of nuclear factor-κB was not significantly affected by dietary MOS (P > 0.05). During 56 h of V. Parahemolyticus challenge period, the accumulated mortality rate of abalone fed diets containing MOS were significantly lower than that of control A0 group in each time point (P < 0.05). Overall, the lowest rate was happened in A8 group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, MOS inclusion in diet has obviously positive effect on growth, immunity and disease resistance capability of abalone, with the optimal level of Actigen® at 0.80 g/kg in diet. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.fsi.2019.09.058,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072673906

A total of 1080 juvenile abalone were randomly distributed into 18 cages (60 per cage). Five formulated diets and dry U. pinnatifida were prepared in triplicate. The 20% U. pinnatifida was included in the control (CLB0) diet. The 25, 50, 75, and 100% of U. pinnatifida were substituted with an equal amount of CLB, referred to as the CLB25, CLB50, CLB75, and CLB100 diets, respectively. Finally, dry U. pinnatifida was prepared to compare the effect of formulated diets on growth performance of abalone. Abalone were fed with one of the experimental diets once a day at a satiation level with a little leftover for 16 weeks. Water stability of dry matter content in all formulated diets was changed over all the observation periods, and their significant interaction was also observed. The retention of dry matter content in all formulated diets was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that in the dry U. pinnatifida at all periods of observation after seawater immersion. Survival, weight gain, and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone fed all formulated diets were greater than those of abalone fed the dry U. pinnatifida. However, weight gain and SGR of abalone fed the CLB25, CLB50, CLB75, and CLB100 diets were not significantly (P > 0.05) different from those of abalone fed the CLB0 diet. Shell height, width, and length of abalone fed all formulated diets were significantly (P < 0.05) higher, wider, and longer than those of abalone fed the dry U. pinnatifida. Proximates of the soft body of abalone were not affected by the experimental diets. In conclusion, U. pinnatifida could be completely (100%) substituted with CLB in formulated abalone feed without retardation in the growth performance of abalone. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",10.1007/s10811-019-01796-8,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072125518

It is associated with high water temperature (greater than 23°C), low dissolved oxygen levels, increased bacterial loads, and immune system suppression during summer months. This study aimed to alleviate mortality rates of greenlip abalone by dietary intervention using vitamin K1 to support the innate immune system and oxidative status. Dietary vitamin K1 at 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 mg kg-1 was added to a commercially formulated diet mash. An additional diet containing 0.5 mg kg-1 of K3 was also used for comparison. Diets were fed to 3-y-old abalone (71.51 g; 79.91 mm) at 22 and 25°C water temperatures for 39 days. No mortalities were observed at 22°C; however, high mortalities were observed in all dietary treatments at the water temperature of 25°C. Compared with the negative control diet (0.0 mg additional inclusion ofK1 or K3 kg-1) at 25°C, the inclusion of vitaminK1 orK3 did not improve survival of greenlip abalone (P > 0.05). VitaminK1 inclusion level resulted in significant increases in vitamin K1 concentration of visceral organ and muscle tissues (P < 0.05). Steady-state levels of vitamin K1 were not reached. Steady-state levels of K2-MK-4 in visceral organ and muscle were reached when analyzed levels of dietary vitamin K1 reached 0.02 mg kg-1. This was also true for K2-MK-7, but in the visceral organ only. Vitamin K1 inclusion level did not significantly affect total hemocyte count, phagocytic activity, or phagocytic index (P > 0.05). Increasing water temperature to 25°C resulted in significant increases in serum catalase activity (22 < 25°C) and vitaminK1 concentration in muscle tissue (22 < 25°C). Comparison of vitamin K1 or K3 at 0.5 mg kg-1 resulted in significant changes to serum catalase activity (K1 > K3) and vitamin K1 concentration in visceral organ (K1 >K3). In conclusion, vitaminK1 at the doses tested, resulted in significant increases in vitaminK1 concentration in visceral organ and muscle tissues, but failed to improve immune function, oxidative status, or survival of greenlip abalone at high summer water temperatures. © 2018 National Shellfisheries Association.

One such seafood is the Xishi abalone (Haliotis gigantea), which displays muscle color polymorphism wherein a small subset of individuals display orange coloration of muscles due to carotenoid enrichment. However, the metabolic basis for carotenoid accumulation has not been thoroughly investigated in marine mollusks. Here, GC-TOF-MS-based untargeted metabolite profiling was used to identify key pathways and metabolites involved in differential carotenoid accumulation in abalones with variable carotenoid contents. Cholesterol was the most statistically significant metabolite that differentiated abalones with orange muscles against those with common white muscles. This observation is likely due to the competitive interactions between cholesterol and carotenoids during cellular absorption. In addition, the accumulation of carotenoids was also related to fatty acid contents. Overall, this study indicates that metabolomics can reflect physiological changes in organisms and provides a useful framework for exploring the mechanisms underlying carotenoid accumulation in abalone types. © 2019, The Author(s).",10.1038/s41598-019-51117-9,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073116337

Regardless of what they are called in any part of the world, a high monetary value is coupled to this animal, because it is largely considered a seafood delicacy. Subsequently, a great deal of research primarily focused on improving the health and growth rates of abalone were carried out to maximise productivity of the commercial farming efforts in various countries. In this review, we comprehensively describe the most recent available scientific literature on abalone biology, and those aspects related to the growth of this organism; more specifically, those factors related to the uptake and breakdown of metabolic products which ensures long-term growth. We subsequently discuss this in terms of basic animal design, farming outcomes, feeding, cellular growth mechanisms and the unique metabolic processes that exist in these species. Using this information and the knowledge of the metabolic processes in other organisms, we additionally make a number of new hypotheses regarding how these metabolic processes may function in terms of abalone growth. Based on the information presented in this review, we also identify major research opportunities and gaps in the existing knowledge of abalone metabolism, which when elucidated may not only serve the purpose of better understanding these organisms growth but also could potentially lead to increased productivity of the abalone commercial farming sector. © 2016 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd",10.1111/raq.12181,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990982116

Each of six groups of abalones was fed a different diet consisting of powdered algae over an 84-day period. Of the six diets, three consisted of a single algal species, i.e., the brown alga Laminaria japonica (L), the green alga Ulva lactuca (U), and the red alga Gracilaria lemaneiformis (G). The remaining three diets had different 1:1 mixtures of the algal species, i.e., L. japonica and U. lactuca (LU), L. japonica and G. lemaneiformis (LG), and U. lactuca and G. lemaneiformis (UG). The FA profiles of the abalone soft body showed clear changes over the experimental period and differed significantly between the different diet groups. Analyses of variation of specific FAs and multidimensional scaling ordination of overall FA profiles showed that H. discus hannai absorbed L. japonica preferentially over G. lemaneiformis in the dietary group LG and discriminated against U. lactuca in groups LU and UG. Additionally, abalone in group LG had the highest specific growth rate (SGR = 0.73 ± 0.06% d−1), while those in group U had the lowest (0.36 ± 0.07% d−1). Our results for dietary preferences and growth performance suggest that G. lemaneiformis might be used as an alternative to the kelp L. japonica in the diet of farmed H. discus hannai, while U. lactuca may not be suitable. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.04.036,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046096611

No recruitment has been detected recently, indicating probable reproductive failure due to low densities. A pilot programme placed a total of over 11,000 hatchery-origin juveniles, age 18–22 months, at 10 sites in the San Juan Islands. Observed (naive) year 1 survival averaged 10.2% (0–23% range) and was most influenced by site compared with lineage or size-at-outplant. Families survived in the approximate proportions that they were outplanted, and there was little support for an effect of size-at-outplant on survival. Detection was low due to the small chance of sighting individuals on complex substrate. When derived from repeated sampling, an upper bound on naive detection rate averaged 0.38 and increased with size. When derived from a closed capture–recapture model, average detection was estimated at 0.19. Growth was highly variable and confounded with detection, but an average 3.4% of detected outplants across all sites (0–7.5% range) had reached reproductive size in 2017. A state-space model of exponential population growth was modified to account for imperfect detection and yielded an estimated density of abalone for each survey. Seven out of eight sites included in the model remained above a target abalone density of 0.3 m                             −2                              throughout the project. The majority of tagged abalone made little net movement over weekly and annual timescales, although some emigration likely reduced survival estimates. The restoration programme is transitioning from a pilot phase to a production phase, including optimization of hatchery and outplant processes. Existing well-performing sites will receive additional cohorts every 4–5 years to maintain aggregation densities. New sites will replace poorly performing ones, although this is hampered by a poor understanding of the mechanisms behind site performance.                          © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",10.1002/aqc.3004,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060994283

The ability to optimize energy acquisition to this episodic thermal oscillation may determine the survival, growth and development of these ectotherms. We compared the physiological and molecular responses of Haliotis discus hannai cultivated in suspended cages to fluctuating or stable temperature conditions. Several physiological indicators (respiration, excretion rates and O:N) were measured in both conditions, and alterations in the proteome during thermal fluctuations were assessed. No summer mortality was observed in abalone cultivated in fluctuating temperatures compared with that at stable high temperatures. Metabolic rates increased sharply during stable warm summer conditions and fluctuated in accordance with short-term temperature fluctuations (20–26 °C). Ammonia excretion rates during acute responses were comparable in both conditions. When abalone were exposed to fluctuating temperatures, enzyme activities were downregulated and structure-related protein expression was upregulated compared with that at an acclimation temperature (26 °C), highlighting that exposure to low temperatures during fluctuations alters molecular processes. Our results reveal that modulation of physiological traits and protein expression during semidiurnal thermal fluctuations may buffer abalone from the lethal consequences of extreme temperatures in summer. © 2019, The Author(s).",10.1038/s41598-019-44526-3,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067034576

The dynamics, processes, environment and management of semi-intensive (several tons ha-1 y-1) mariculture IMTA started in the early 1970s, at the National Center for Mariculture (NCM) in Eilat, with several models that combined flow-through and recirculation features between primary (fed) and secondary (extractive) species. The seawater fishponds differed from freshwater ponds mainly in the continuous exchange with water from the open sea, to stabilize salinity and other water quality features. The primary (fed) fish was mostly the seabream (Sparus aurata), seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), shrimp (Penaeus semisulcatus) and mullets (Mugil cephalus and Liza ramada). At first, the extractive component included microalgae, oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and clams (Ruditapes philippnmarum). In more progressive models, plastic-lined double drain ponds and tanks are used. Several other species, for example: clams, seaweed (the macroalgae Ulva spp. and Gracilaria spp.), abalone (Haliotis tuberculata and H. discus hannai), sea urchins (Paracentrotus lividus and Tripneustes gratilla elatensis), shrimp, brine shrimp (Artemia salina) are used.

Therefore, the inhibition of VM is crucial to the clinical treatment of tumors. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of a novel peptide, KVEPQDPSEW (AATP), isolated from abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) on HT1080 cells by migration, invasion analysis and the mode of action. The results showed that AATP effectively inhibited MMPs by blocking MAPKs and NF-κB pathways, leading to the downregulation of metastasis of tumor cells. Moreover, AATP significantly inhibited VM and pro-angiogenic factors, including VEGF and MMPs by suppression of AKT/mTOR signaling. In addition, molecular docking was used to study the interaction of AATP and HIF-1α, and the results showed that AATP was combined with an active site of HIF-1α by a hydrogen bond. The effect of AATP on anti-metastatic and anti-vascular in HT1080 cells revealed that AATP may be a potential lead compound for treatment of tumors in the future. © 2019 by the Authors.",10.3390/md17040244,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065446630

In contrast, secondary shell openings are rare in snails and are largely limited to slit shells, keyhole limpets, and abalone of the Vetigastropoda. When such features occur in other groups, they are noteworthy and raise interesting questions concerning the functional/adaptive significance of these shell modifications. Here we report on one such modification in a newly described species of vermetid snail. Members of the worm-snail family Vermetidae are sessile, suspension-feeding caenogastropods found in warm temperate to tropical marine environments worldwide. As juveniles, vermetids permanently cement their shells to hard substrata and subsequently produce irregularly coiled polychaete-like shell tubes with indeterminate growth and typically a simple circular shell aperture. In one previously studied group (genus Cupolaconcha), the aperture can be covered by a shell dome with a central slit that retains its widest opening in the center of the aperture. Vermetid specimens collected in the barrier reefs of Belize and the Florida Keys show an extreme aperture modification previously unknown in Gastropoda, in which the shell opening is covered by an apertural dome that leaves two equal-sized circular holes, each corresponding to the inflow and outflow water exchange currents of the animal's mantle cavity. The function of this perforated apertural dome is unknown, and it is in some ways antithetical to the suspension feeding habit of these snails. Further field and laboratorybased studies will be needed to clarify the functional significance and trade-offs of this unique morphology. The new taxon, which is not closely related to the previously described dome-building clade Cupolaconcha, is described and named as Vermetus biperforatus Bieler, Collins, Golding & Rawlings n. sp. © 2019 Bieler et al.",10.7717/peerj.6569,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063627384

In this study, a member of the invertebrate defensins was cloned and characterized from the small abalone Haliotis diversicolor, designated HdDef-2. The HdDef-2 cDNA contained a 201 bp open reading frame encoding 66 amino acids including a signal peptide of 18 amino acids and a mature peptide of 48 amino acids. The mature peptide of HdDef-2 possessed similar features to other AMPs, such as lower molecular mass, net positive charge (+1), and a high hydrophobic residue ratio (45%). In addition, six cysteines in the mature peptide were arranged in the pattern C-X16-C-X3-C-X9-C-X4-C-X1-C and stabilized the α-helix/β-sheet motif (CSαβ) with three disulfide bonds (C1-C4, C2-C5 and C3-C6) in the predicted tertiary structure. Moreover, the similar three-dimensional structure to Anopheles gambiae defensin and a phylogenetic analysis suggest that HdDef-2 may be a new member of the arthropod defensin family. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that HdDef-2 transcripts were constitutively expressed in the mantle, gill, hepatopancreas, and foot, with the highest level in the hepatopancreas. It was observed that HdDef-2 transcripts were significantly induced in the hepatopancreas after infection by Vibrio harveyi. These results indicate that HdDef-2 may be involved in the immune response against invading pathogenic bacteria, but future work is needed to verify its antimicrobial activity in protein level and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.cbpb.2019.05.004,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065646093
Hwang E.K.; Ha D.S.; Park C.S.,The influences of temperature and irradiance on thallus length of Saccharina japonica (Phaeophyta) during the early stages of cultivation,2018,Journal of Applied Phycology,30,5,2875,2882,,"Korean Saccharina japonica is highly valued, both for human consumption and abalone feed. For the stable production of abalone feed, fresh seaweed biomass is required throughout the year. However, currently, the production of farmed Saccharina is limited by environmental conditions such as temperature, irradiance, and nutrient availability between August and November. Due to shortages experienced in supply, the production of early-season biomass can be highly profitable and, therefore, some famers attempt to start their cultivation activities before prevailing, surface seawater temperatures (SST) are optimal. However, attempting to cultivate too early, can lead to total crop failure. Young kelp sporophytes are easily destroyed between 18 and 22 °C SST, which can occur during the early nursery period when the materials are confined to tanks. This study investigated the growth of S. japonica thalli and photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm) under five temperatures (i.e., 18–26 °C, at 2° increments) and five irradiances (i.e., 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 μmol photons m−2 s−1). This was undertaken for four different size groups of sporophyte thalli (i.e., 0.25, 1, 5, 10 mm). There were different responses of the initial groups of S. japonica showing different tolerances to temperature and irradiance. In general, the smaller plants (1 mm) were more tolerant of sub-optimal conditions than their larger cohorts. These results indicated the optimum temperature and irradiance ranges for different size groups of S. japonica thalli which, if adopted in management protocols, could contribute to enhanced profitability and a more stable and evenly distributed production of Saccharina raw materials over an entire annual basis. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",10.1007/s10811-018-1565-4,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049581332
Zeng L.; Zhong S.; You W.; Ke C.,Effects of south-north relay mode on the nutritive compositions of Haliotis discus hannai; [南北接力养殖对皱纹盘鲍营养成分的影响],2020,Journal of Fisheries of China,44,1,111,117,,"The south-north relay mode of abalone culture, a common practice in China, was designed to increase the survival rate of abalone in the south in summer. The abalone was usually transported to the north(Rongcheng, Shandong) in April from southern China(Lianjiang, Fujian)and returned to the south in November. In this study, the impact of this mode on the nutritive compositions of abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) was investigated.The main method was the series of GB.5009. The determined indexes include moisture, cholesterol, ash, protein, lipid, glycogen, collagen, mineral elements(Mg, Al, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Se),delicious amino acids(aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, arginine, methionine, lysine),taurine and fatty acid. SPSS 24.0 statistical software(independent sample t-test)was used to determine the significance of the differences between two groups. The experimental results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation.Two groups of adult abalone(two years old)with the same algae diet (Gracilaria lemaneiformis) were sampled for the analysis in December, 2017. One group was cultured in Lianjiang, Fujian (Southern China) without migration (LJ-DD) and the other was moved to Shandong (Northern China) before the summer and returned to Lianjiang in November (SD-DD). Live samples were moved to laboratory within 24 hours, taking abalone foot muscle to freeze drying after dissection and grinding into powder. These powder were saved in −80 °C freezer.The results showed that contents of ash and collagen were higher in LJ-DD, but not significant. The cholesterol, lipid and glycogen content were higher in SD-DD, but not significant. Moisture content was significantly higher in SD-DD (76.50%WW) than in LJ-DD(73.70%WW) while total protein content was significantly lower in SD-DD(48.40%DW). For mineral profile, Se content was significantly higher in LJ-DD(0.07 mg/100g)than SD-DD(0.05 mg/100g). Besides, Mg and Al contents were higher in SD-DD and Ca, Fe, Cu and Zn contents were lower in SD-DD, but the differences were not significant. For amino acid profile, the contents of glutamic acid, arginine, lysine and total delicious amino acid were significantly higher in LJ-DD than in SD-DD. Besides, taurine content was significantly lower in SD-DD than in LJ-DD. For fatty acid profile, C20:3n6 content was significantly higher in LJ-DD than in SD-DD. SFA and N-3 fatty acid were higher in SD-DD，and MUFA, PUFA and EPA+DHA contents were higher in LJ-DD，but not significantly. The value of N6/N3 was lower in SD-DD than in LJ-DD, but the differences were not significant. Overall，two groups had similar composition, but SD-DD had higher nutritional values than LJ-DD.To summarize, the south-north relay mode has both some negative influences and some positive influences on the nutritional quality of H. discus hannai, but such difference is not significant as a whole. © 2020 Shanghai Ocean University.

A 60-day feeding trial was conducted with abalone (initial weight: 3.17 ± 0.01 g), which were exposed to 0.34 mg/L of waterborne Cd. During a feeding trial, abalone were fed graded levels of Se at 0.10 (controls), 1.31, and 4.20 mg/kg diet respectively. Results showed that there was no significant difference in specific growth rate and survival rate of abalone among the three treatments. Compared with the controls, dietary Se significantly decreased Cd concentrations in serum, muscle, mantle, gill, mantle, and hepatopancreas of abalone. Besides, compared with the controls, dietary Se significantly increased metallothionein concentration in the hepatopancreas of abalone. Additionally, compared with the controls, dietary Se significantly decreased concentrations of malondiadehyde and protein carbonyl in hepatopancreas of abalone. Meanwhile, compared with the controls, dietary Se significantly increased activities of glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin reductase, and thioredoxin peroxidase, and concentration of glutathione in the hepatopancreas of abalone. Based on the data above, in abalone, dietary Se showed protective effects against waterborne Cd. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/are.13786,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050698870
Sandamalika W.M.G.; Priyathilaka T.T.; Lee S.; Yang H.; Lee J.,Immune and xenobiotic responses of glutathione S-Transferase theta (GST-θ) from marine invertebrate disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus): With molecular characterization and functional analysis,2019,Fish and Shellfish Immunology,91,,159,171,,"Representing a multifunctional complex group of proteins, glutathione S- transferases (GSTs) play a major role in the phase II detoxification process in a wide range of organisms. This study focused on the potential detoxification ability of disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) GST theta (AbGST-θ) under different stress conditions with special reference to post immune challenges. Characterization of AbGST-θ revealed with 226 amino acids, 26.6 kDa of predicted molecular mass and 8.9 of theoretical isoelectric point. As illustrated in the multiple sequence alignment, eight glutathione binding sites (G-sites) and ten substrate binding sites (H-sites) were identified in well-distinct N-terminal and C-terminal domains of AbGST-θ, respectively. AbGST-θ exhibited its highest sequence identity with Mizuhopecten yessoensis (59.1%) and the phylogenetic tree clearly positioned AbGST-θ with pre-defined GST-θ molluscan homologues. The AbGST-θ was highly expressed in the digestive tract of un-challenged abalones. Upon administering the challenge experiment, AbGST-θ showed significant modulations in their transcriptional levels depending on the time and the tissue type. The optimum temperature was 37 °C and optimum pH was 7.5 for AbGST-θ. The determined enzyme kinetic parameters of AbGST-θ showed low affinity towards 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and glutathione (GSH) as substrates. Nonetheless, with Cibacron blue IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) was calculated to be 0.08 μM while observing 100% inhibition with 100 μM. Furthermore, AbGST-θ resulted in significant protection ability towards H2O2, CdCl2, and ZnCl2 in the disk diffusion assay. Collectively, this study provides evidences for the detoxification ability and the immunological host defensive capability of AbGST-θ in disk abalone. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.fsi.2019.04.004,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065745406

However, it may also influence gonad development, thereby limiting the potential benefit of including soya in feed. This is the first study to determine both the effect of dietary soya level on growth and reproduction of abalone and the role of crystalline isoflavones (ISO) at concentrations occurring in soya diets. Abalone (40–50 g individual                             −1                             ) were fed seven isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets. Three diets contained 5, 10 or 19% soya, while an additional three diets included graded levels of ISO. A fishmeal (FM)-only diet was included. The inclusion of ISO did not influence gonad development or abalone growth while soya inclusion level had an effect on both reproductive development and abalone growth. After 180 days, male abalone fed FM with soya inclusion had the highest whole body mass (69.0 ± 2.48 g abalone                             −1                             ), meat mass index (60.5 ± 1.88%), visceral mass index (13.0 ± 0.27%) and gonad bulk index (42.7 ± 9.82 g abalone                             −1                             ). Weight loss was observed in all treatments probably due to spawning events. The frequency distribution of the predominant oocyte stage, stage 7 was influenced by soya concentration. The increase in the frequency of stage 7 oocytes in abalone fed FM with soya did not reduce the number of oocytes (45.0 ± 3.01 oocytes mm                             −2                             ), while the number of oocytes (o) in abalone fed the FM-only diets decreased with increasing abundance of stage 7 oocytes, possibly due to an increase in oocyte size.                          © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/s10499-018-0315-6,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056789997

Eight-hundred forty juveniles were distributed into 12 containers. Three formulated diets were prepared in triplicate. A 15% Undaria was included in the control diet. The 15% Undaria was substituted with a same amount of WRB and TSS, referred to as the DRG and TSS diets, respectively. Finally, dry Undaria was also prepared to compare effect of the formulated diets on performance of abalone. The experimental diets were fed to abalone once a day at a satiation level with a little leftover. The feeding trial lasted for 16 weeks. Crude protein, crude lipid, and ash content of the experimental diets changed over all period of time. Higher crude protein and lipid and ash contents retained in all formulated diets compared to the Undaria were observed at 24 and 48 h after seawater immersion. Survival of abalone was not affected by the experimental diets. Weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone fed the TSS diet was greater than all other diets. Weight gain and SGR of abalone fed the control diet was not different from those of abalone fed the WRB diet. Proximates of the soft body of abalone was affected by the diets. In conclusion, WRB and TSS are the promising feed ingredients to replace Undaria in abalone feed; especially, TSS is superior to either Undaria or WRB. The formulated diets produced improved growth performance of abalone over the single Undaria. © 2018 The Author(s).",10.1186/s41240-018-0089-9,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046035486

Protein digestibility measured in experimental tanks was higher than those measured in indoor and outdoor commercial tanks, regardless of inert marker used. Chromic oxide led to overestimated ADCP compared to when measured using yttrium and ytterbium. There were no significant interactions between temperature and inert markers when measuring ADCP and apparent digestibility of gross energy (ADGE). However, there was a significant difference of ADCP amongst inert markers when measured in greenlip abalone cultured at two temperatures. While measurements of ADge calculated using three inert markers shared the same value. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",10.1088/1755-1315/139/1/012004,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046073288

This macroalga is widely cultivated along the coasts of China from south to north, but its cultivation period is limited by high temperature in summer. In the current study, the effects of heat and phytohormone treatments on Rubisco large subunit (rbcL) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) were investigated by using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot technologies in G. lemaneiformis. The results showed that transcript and protein levels of rbcL in G. lemaneiformis were inhibited by heat stress (33 °C), however, 100 μmol/L salicylic acid (SA100) and 50 μmol/L methyl jasmonate (MJ50) treatments reduced the inhibition of high temperature on the expression of rbcL. In SA100 and MJ50 groups, the transcriptional expression of rbcL increased to 1.31- and 1.32-fold at 3 h, and the protein levels of rbcL were enhanced to 1.36- and 2.10-fold at 24 h compared to the heat-stress group, respectively. Moreover, SA100 and MJ50 effectively alleviated the inhibition effect of heat stress on Rubisco activity, and recovered the Rubisco activation states. However, the addition of 50 μmol/L abscisic acid (ABA50) mainly inhibited rbcL expression and Rubisco activity. Heat stress stimulated the transcript and protein levels of HSP70; hsp70 transcript expression further rose by 0.53–1.00 times at 3 h, and its protein expression enhanced by 0.93–2.45 times at 24 h in the heat-stress group after applying SA100, MJ50 or ABA50. In conclusion, SA, MJ and ABA play a certain role in regulating the inhibition of photosynthesis enzyme and the induction of heat shock proteins caused by heat stress. © 2019 Shanghai Ocean University.

During an 8-week culturing experiment in an indoor aquarium and a 2-week V. parahaemolyticus artificial infection experiment, the control group was fed with untreated food once a day, while the experimental groups (L1, L2 and L3) were fed with Lactobacillus pentosus added food. The concentration of probiotics in the experimental food was 103 cfu/g (L1), 105 cfu/g (L2) and 107 cfu/g (L3), respectively. The results showed that the survival rate, shell length-specific growth rate, and the food conversion rate (FCR) of abalones in L1 and L2 were significantly higher than the control group. The food intake of abalones in L3 was significantly lower than that in L1, L2 and the control group, but there was no significant difference in FCR identified between L1, L2 and L3. In the L. pentosus-added groups, the total number of blood lymphocytes, lysozyme activity, acid phosphatase, superoxide dismutase, and expression levels of Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx) were significantly higher than the control group, while the malondialdehyde (MDA) content was significantly lower than the control group. The phagocytic activity of blood lymphocytes, catalase activity and the expression levels of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) of abalones in the control group were significantly lower than that in L1 and L2, but there was no significant difference when compared with L3. The levels of O2 −, NO produced by respiratory burst of blood lymphocytes and the expression levels of catalase (CAT) in L1 and L2 were significantly higher than both L3 and the control group. Seven days after infection with V. parahaemolyticus, all abalones in the control group were dead. After 14 days the cumulative mortality rate of abalones in the L. pentosus-added groups was significantly lower than that in the control group. Therefore, the 103 cfu/g and 105 cfu/g L. pentosus-added food not only promoted food intake and growth of abalones, but also improved their non-specific immunity and reduced V. parahaemolyticus infection, indicating that this strain is a good potential candidate for probiotic added food in the aquaculture industry. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.fsi.2018.04.010,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045744240

To decrease health risks to the public, an efficient and accurate method for the synchronously determination of seven harmful MCs in shellfish samples was developed by employing a hydrophile lipophile balance/polydimethylsiloxane (HLB/PDMS)-coated stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) method coupled with high-performance liquid chromatogram and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The most influential factors of SBSE, sample loading pH, extraction time, and desorption time, were optimized and found to be 5, 60 min, and 10 min, respectively. For the MS ionization, all the doubly charged ions of MCs were used as precursors instead of [M + H]+ for the determination of MCs in the multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The method was validated in terms of linearity (R2 = 0.9953~0.9991), sensitivity (LOD ≤ 0.6 μg kg−1 and LOQ ≤ 2.0 μg kg−1), precision (RSD ≤ 12.7%), and recovery (51.7 to 72.3%). With this approach, three randomly chosen batches of Patinopecten yessoensis (P. yessoensis), Haliotis discus (H. discus), and Crassostrea virginica (C. virginica) from the local market were tested. MC-RR and MC-LR were detected to be MCs positive, which were probably induced by the diet of planktonic cyanobacteria. The successfully applied HLB/PDMS-coated SBSE and HPLC-MS/MS method exhibited great advantage in fast analysis of low concentrations of MCs in foods to ensure the safety of shellfish and its products.

In previous studies, we investigated whole-organism physiological patterns and cellular metabolism in gill and muscle of the marine gastropod Haliotis fulgens in response to increasing temperature (18 °C to 32 °C at +3 °C per day) under hypoxia (50% air saturation), hypercapnia (1000 μatm pCO2) and both factors combined. Here, we report investigations of the molecular responses of H. fulgens to temperature and identify mechanisms concomitantly affected by hypoxia and hypercapnia. A de novo transcriptome assembly with subsequent quantitative PCR and correlation network analysis of genes involved in the molecular response were used to unravel the correlations between gene expression patterns under the different experimental conditions. The correlation networks identified a shift from the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism (down-regulated) to the up-regulation of Hsp70 during warming under all experimental conditions in gill and muscle, indicating a strong up-regulation of damage prevention and repair systems at sustained cellular energy production. However, a higher capacity for anaerobic succinate production was evicted in gill, matching with observations from our previous studies indicating succinate accumulation in gill but not in muscle. Additionally, warming under hypoxia and hypercapnia kept mRNA levels of citrate synthase in both tissues unchanged following a similar pattern as muscle enzyme capacity from a previous study, suggesting an emphasis on maintaining rather than down-regulating mitochondrial activity. © 2019 The Authors",10.1016/j.margen.2019.01.007,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060846898

Preparation of high-quality protein samples remains the key in high-quality 2-DE for proteomic analysis. Samples with high endogenous levels of interfering molecules, such as salts, nucleic acids, lipids, and polysaccharides, would yield a low-quality 2-DE gel and hinder the analysis. Recently, a TRIzol-based protein extraction method has gained prominence and has attracted attention due to its promising performance in high-quality 2-DE. The authors evaluate the use of this approach for four valuable dried food products, namely two dried seafood products (abalone slices and whelk slices) and two traditional Chinese tonic foods (ganoderma and caterpillar fungus). The results indicate that 2-DE gels obtained through the TRIzol-based method are of high-quality and are comparable to those obtained through the trichloroacetic acid–acetone method in terms of spot number, spot intensity, and resolution. The TRIzol-based method is generally applicable to dried food samples and is simple and fast, which greatly streamlines the protein extraction procedure. Additionally, it enables the concurrent extraction and analysis of RNA, DNA, and protein from the same sample. © 2018 by the authors.

A total of 1260 juvenile abalone were randomly distributed in 21, 100-L net cages (60 per cage). Six formulated diets were prepared. Twenty percent U. pinnatifida powder was included in the control (SH0) diet. The U. pinnatifida component of the experimental diets was substituted with S. horneri at the rates of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%, referred to as the SH20, SH40, SH60, SH80, and SH100 diets, respectively. Finally, dry U. pinnatifida was prepared to compare effect of the formulated diet on abalone. Abalone were fed with one of the experimental diets once a day for 16 weeks. Water stability of nutrient content in all formulated diets was changed with time. Survival of abalone fed all formulated diets was higher than that of abalone fed the U. pinnatifida. Abalone fed the SH0, SH20, SH40, SH60, and SH80 diets achieved greater weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) than those of abalone fed the SH100 diet and U. pinnatifida. The greatest weight gain and SGR were obtained in abalone fed the SH60 diet. The proximate composition of the soft body of abalone, except for crude protein, was not affected by the experimental diets. In conclusion, U. pinnatifida up to 80% could be substituted with S. horneri when 20% U. pinnatifida was included in formulated abalone feed. The SH60 diet achieved the best growth performance of abalone. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",10.1007/s10811-018-1672-2,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056002098

In this study, the antioxidant and angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition effects of the boiled abalone by-products (BABs) were investigated. BABs have high antioxidant activities against free radicals (1,1-diphenyl-2-pycryl-hydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl, peroxyl, and superoxide radicals), reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress, and DNA damage in H2O2-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages. The structure of the purified peptide was identified to be ATPGDEG (MW 752 Da), and the ACE inhibition pattern of the peptide was found to be noncompetitive. In addition, the peptide exhibited an antihypertensive effect according to time-course measurement after oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).

One approach is to increase nitrogen reuse within the system by feeding nitrogen-rich aquaculture effluent to deposit feeders, thereby closing the aquaculture nitrogen-loop. This study, for the first time and on a laboratory-scale, has reared juveniles of the sea cucumber Holothuria scabra at high densities solely on particulate organic waste from a commercial-scale land-based abalone recirculating aquaculture system. Furthermore, growth rates and biomass yields were increased significantly by adjusting the effluent C:N from 5:1 to 20:1 by adding exogenous organic carbon sources (glucose, starch and cellulose), so fuelling accelerated heterotrophic bacterial production within the redox-stratified tank sediment. Sea cucumber juveniles reared solely on effluent had a biomass density of 711 g m−2 after four months whereas animals reared on starch-amended effluent (the best performing treatment) had a final density of 1011 g m−2. Further optimisation of this approach could increase biomass yields and pave the way for the commercial cultivation of deposit feeding animals on waste streams, thus contributing to more environmentally sustainable aquaculture. Here, the nitrogen that originated from fishmeal is not lost through the discharge of aquaculture effluent; rather, it is immobilised into single cell biomass that is up-cycled into high-value secondary biomass. We demonstrate that sea cucumbers can be produced at high density through the manipulation of the C:N ratio of aquaculture effluent. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.09.024,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053772432

In this study, abalone Haliotis diversicolor were fed with different probiotic-supplemented diets for 180 days, containing Bacillus stratosphericus A3440, Phaeobacter daeponensis AP1220, and a mixture of the two strains. Probiotic supplementation significantly increased shell length and wet weight of juvenile abalone (p < 0.05). Compared with those non-treatment group, trypsin and lipase activities were increased significantly in the gastrointestinal tract of animals fed with A3440 or bacterial mixture (p < 0.05). A subsequent ten-day of challenging trial against Vibrio harveyi, the animals with AP1220 had ~90% survival rate as against ~60% survival rate for the non-treated animals. Likewise, in situ glutathione peroxidase, catalase, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, and superoxide dismutase assays showed that the probiotics significantly improved immune response of H. diversicolor (p < 0.05). 13,622 OTUs were obtained from abalone intestine microbiome by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. Microbial diversity indices and richness estimates in the non-treated group declined before and after Vibrio infection trial. Conversely, these indexes enhanced to different levels in probiotics treatments, and the A3440 group restored and reached the highest value. Cluster analysis showed that probiotic could re-establish and subsequently balance the gut microbial community after the challenge trial. Furthermore, these potential probiotics had a positive effect on the number of beneficial endogenous bacteria in the abalone gut, such as bacilli and actinobacterial species. Thus, dietary administration of B. stratosphericus, P. daeponensis and their mixture could improve the nutrient and health status of abalone H. diversicolor. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.05.011,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047085669

The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of the commercial animal feed product Orego-Stim (OS), containing oregano essential oil in reducing the mortality of 3-y-old greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) exposed to high water temperature (25°C). Inclusion levels of 0.0 (commercial control diet), 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, and 4.0% OS were added into a commercial feed formulation and diets were fed to 3-y-old greenlip abalone (67.98 g, 77.01 mm shell length) at two water temperatures (22°C and 25°C) for 47 days. Survival and immune parameters including phagocytic activity, total hemocyte count (THC), and activities of the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were measured. Survival was high at 22°C with no significant differences in mortality between treatments. Irrespective of this, exposure to elevated water temperature (25°C) resulted in significantly higher mortalities for all diet treatments (P < 0.05), without any effect of diet. Low ferric reducing antioxidant potential values were observed for all diets. Phagocytic activity remained stable for all temperature and OS treatments (48.82% ± 1.31%). The dietary inclusion of OS and increased water temperature increased the THC compared with the commercial control diet treatment at 22°C. Superoxide dismutase was significantly elevated in greenlip abalone fed the commercial control (0.56 ± 0.08 U mL-1), and CAT was significantly higher when fed the 4.0% OS diet treatment at 25°C (18.93 ± 2.25 nmol min-1 mL-1). Despite failing to increase survival, OS significantly enhanced feed intake at both temperatures at 2.0% and 4.0% compared with the commercial control diet treatment, highlighting its ability as a feeding stimulant (P < 0.05).",10.2983/035.036.0326,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043763286

The IMTA of abalone and kelp has been well-practiced in Sanggou Bay, China. In the present study, the growth and carbon allocation of abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) of different sizes (S, small; M, medium; L, large) fed kelp (Laminaria japonica) were investigated at different temperatures (10, 14, 18 and 22°C). A two-way ANOVA showed that both size and temperature significantly affected the specific growth rate (SGR), food consumption (FC), feed conversion ratio (FCR) and apparent digestion rate (ADR) of abalone (p < 0.05), and significant interactions between the two factors were detected (p < 0.05). Curve estimation showed a significant quadratic relationship between SGR and temperature in each size class (p < 0.05). The two-way ANOVA also showed that both size and temperature significantly affected all the measures of carbon allocation (p < 0.05) except for the carbon lost in metabolism (p > 0.05). All the measures of carbon allocation increased with the increasing temperature. It was concluded that it was better to culture H. discus hannai with a body weight less than 15 g at 20–22°C, and more than 15 g at 15–20°C to achieve good growth. The growth carbon of kelp around the abalone farm should be more than the metabolic carbon expenditure, which means the growth of kelp around the abalone farm should be more than 23.06%–61.91% of food consumption to maintain a carbon sink IMTA system without any carbon release. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/are.13769,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049535763

In a 90-day study, the growth and nutrient utilization of juvenile greenlip abalone (1.82 g, 23.23 mm) fed diets containing Ulva sp. protein extract (UPE) were investigated. Animals were fed one of the four formulated test diets containing graded levels of UPE (0%, 5%, 10%, and 20%) or a commercial diet that served as a control for the 0% basal diet. Diets were formulated to contain 37% crude protein, 5% lipid, and 17.5 MJ/kg gross energy. The specific growth rate and shell growth rate (μm/day) of abalone fed the four experimental diets were similar. Dietary inclusions of UPE supported the growth of juvenile greenlip abalone and may be used to reduce dietary inclusions of solvent extracted soybean meal, dehulled lupins, and wheat flour. Currently, UPE is cost prohibitive for commercial use in greenlip abalone diet. As UPE is a by-product of the macroalgae industry, the cost of UPE would likely become more economically viable as macroalgae production increases in the future to include in diets for greenlip abalone. Once economically viable, we recommend a dietary inclusion of up to 20% UPE meal for greenlip abalone.",10.2983/035.036.0325,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043785842

However, little is known about the involvement of other 5-HT receptor subfamilies in the reproduction process. In the present study, we identified the cDNAs encoding eight subtypes of 5-HT receptors from the ganglia tissues of the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai (Mollusca; Gastropoda; Haliotidae), and examined the gonadal expression of the transcripts of 5-HT receptors. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that the molluskan 5-HT receptors are largely classified into four major clades: 5-HT1/5/7, 5-HT2, 5-HT4, and 5-HT6. Among the H. discus hannai (Hdh) 5-HT1-7 transcripts, Hdh5-HT1B, 4A, 4B, and 6 were the major subtypes detected in the mature ovary. Estradiol-17β injection into the pedal sinus induced the downregulation of 5-HT4B and upregulation of 5-HT6 transcripts in the ovary of mature abalone within 72 h. In HEK293 cells overexpressing Hdh5-HT1B, forskolin-stimulated cAMP response element luciferase (CRE-Luc) reporter activity was inhibited by 5-HT in a dose-dependent manner, whereas serum response element luciferase (SRE-Luc) activity was not affected. In Hdh5-HT4A-expressing HEK293 cells, forskolin-stimulated CRE-Luc and SRE-Luc reporter activities were both marginally increased by treatment with a high dose of 5-HT.

Due to the microstructure and its unique toughening mechanisms, nacre possesses an excellent combination of specific strength, stiffness and toughness. This study deals with the possibility of using nacre fragments obtained from abalone shell for making a bulletproof armor system. A composite plate laminated with abalone shell fragments is made and compression and bend tests are carried out. In addition, a bulletproof test is performed with hybrid armor systems which are composed of an alumina plate, a composite plate, and aramid woven fabric to verify the ballistic performance of nacre. The compressive strength of the composite plate is around 258.3MPa. The bend strength and modulus of the composite plate decrease according to the plate thickness and are about 149.2MPa and 50.3 GPa, respectively, for a 4.85 mm thick plate.

In the present study, a novel defensin was identified in small abalone (Haliotis diversicolor) that was denoted as HdDef1 by using RNA-seq and RACE techniques. The HdDef1 cDNA contained a 201 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 66 amino acids including a signal peptide of 18 amino acids and a mature peptide of 48 amino acids. The mature peptide of Hd-Def1 shared common features of AMPs, such as lower molecular mass, net positive charge (+1) and high hydrophobic residue ratio (45%). In addition, six cysteines in the mature peptide were arranged in the pattern of C-X16-C-X3-C-X9-C-X4-C-X1-C and stabilized the α-helix/β-sheet motif (CSαβ) with three disulfide bonds (C1-C4, C2-C5 and C3-C6) in the predicted tertiary structure. Moreover, by comparision with the similar three-dimensional structure of Anopheles gambiae defensin and phylogenetic analysis, it is suggested that HdDef1 might be a new member of the arthropod defensin family. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis reveals that HdDef1 transcripts were expressed constitutively in intestine, head, gill, hepatopancreas, mantle and foot, with the highest level in hepatopancreas. After being challenged with Vibrio harveyi, HdDef1 transcripts were induced significantly in hepatopancreas. The results indicate that HdDef1 might have an important function in host defense against invasive pathogenic bacteria, but its antimicrobial activity at protein level needs further study. © 2019 Editorial Office of South China Fisheries Science.

Two groups of abalone were fed (1% body weight per day) over a four-month period with different diets. The control diet consisted of a standard commercial pellet feed (AbMax 16), whereas the treatment diet was additionally enriched with the probiotic mix. At the end of the experiment, probiotic-fed animals showed improved growth compared with control-fed abalone in length (32.3% vs 22.3%), width (31.9% vs 20.7%) and wet weight (109.6% vs 72.8%), respectively. Haemolymph sampling was conducted at the beginning of the experiment and after 2 and 4 months. Haemolymph samples were analysed for total haemocyte count (THC) and viability, presence of apoptotic cells and production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Compared with control abalone, probiotic-fed abalone had significantly higher THC (1.9 × 106 vs 5.6 × 105 cells), higher viability (90.8% vs 75.6%), higher percentage of ROS-positive cells (19.4% vs 0.5%) and higher numbers of non-apoptotic cells (88.0% vs 78.0%), respectively. These results indicate that the probiotic-enriched diet enhanced the immunostimulatory mechanisms, with a simultaneous low-level up-regulation of ROS production as a priming mechanism of the antibacterial defence system. Metabolomics-based profiling of foot muscle tissue additionally revealed that probiotic-fed abalone differentially expressed 17 unique metabolites, including amino acids, fatty acids and TCA cycle related compounds. These data suggest that the probiotic-supplemented diet can also alter central carbon metabolic processes, which may improve the survival, as well as the growth of abalone. © 2018",10.1016/j.fsi.2018.08.034,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052055516

There is little known about the abalone innate immune system against pathogen infection. Clip-domain serine proteases (cSPs) are increasingly recognized to play important roles in host immune defense in invertebrates. In this study, we cloned a cSP (Hdh-cSP) from abalone (Haliotis discus hannai). We found out that Hdh-cSP was widely expressed in multiple tissues of abalone, with highest level in the immune-like organ, hepatopancreas. V. parahemolyticus infection induced significantly elevated expression of Hdh-cSP in addition to better-characterized innate immune component genes including Rel/NF-κB, allograft inflammatory factor (ALInFa), macrophage expressed protein (MEP) and caspase-8. Importantly, the silencing of Hdh-cSP reduced the expression of these genes, suggesting that Hdh-cSP was an upstream regulatory factor in V. parahemolyticus infection. Further analysis showed that apoptosis of hemocytes was inhibited when the transcription of Hdh-cSP was knocked down, suggesting that Hdh-cSP participated in cell apoptosis by regulation of caspase 8 expression in V. parahemolyticus infection.

Histological examination of affected scallops in southern Hokkaido typically revealed intense host responses: hemocyte infiltration, an abundance of necrotic hemocytes, lysis of muscle fibers and in some instances melanin deposits when the lesions occurred adjacent to the shell. Microbiota analysis showed that Francisella halioticida was dominant in the lesions, and in situ hybridization using F. halioticida specific probes also confirmed the presence of this bacterium within the lesions. A F. halioticida specific PCR assay detected this bacterium in the majority of scallop lesions tested. Subsequently, three bacterial isolates were obtained from scallop lesions on modified Eugon agar supplemented with antibiotics, and these bacterial isolates were found to be F. halioticida by 16S rRNA and rpoB gene sequences. These results suggest that infection with F. halioticida is the most likely cause of the adductor muscle lesions observed in Yesso scallops.

Characteristic caveolin superfamily domain (Glu3 – Lys126) and two possible transmembrane domains (Cys48 - Tyr67 and Ile103 - Phe120) were identified in the HdCAV1 protein. Homology analysis revealed that HdCAV1 shared higher identity (>47%) with molluscans, but lower identity with other species. Phylogenetic tree constructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method revealed a distinct evolutionary pathway for molluscans. Transcriptional analysis by SYBR Green qPCR showed the highest expression of HdCAV1 mRNA in late veliger stage, as compared to that in other embryonic developmental stages of disk abalone. In adult animals, gill tissue showed highest HdCAV1 transcript levels under normal physiological condition. Stimulations with two bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes), viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, and two pathogen-associated molecular patterns (LPS and poly I:C) significantly modulated the expression of HdCAV1 transcripts. Collectively, these data suggest that CAV1 plays an important role in embryogenesis and host immune defense in disk abalone. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.gep.2017.11.003,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034451910
Sawangwong P.; Chen N.; Ke C.; You W.,Study on Tolerance and Immune Response of Pacific Abalone Haliotis discus hannai during Simulated Air Exposure of Live Transportation,2019,Journal of Shellfish Research,38,2,429,437,,"Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) is an economically important species of sea snails found in China. Live abalones sold in domestic markets are sealed in insulated containers for transportation over extended periods of time (6-24 h), during which this species may experience stressful conditions and spoil. This study assessed the survival rate and weight loss rate (WLR) of abalone under various treatments to determine the optimal packaging transport conditions. Specifically, temperature, supplemental humidity and oxygen, and air exposure during simulated live transport were investigated. Results revealed that the survival rate increased significantly after cold-water shock and humidity control, whereas oxygen supplements did not have a significant effect. In addition, WLR significantly increased over time (P < 0.05). An additional experiment was conducted to investigate the stress response caused by air exposure. Hemocyte parameters, including total hemocyte count (THC), hemocyte mortality, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), were estimated for 2, 6, 12, 24, and 30 h after air exposure at different temperatures. Results revealed that THC significantly decreased after 30 h of air exposure at 5 and 10°C, and after 24 h of air exposure at 20°C. Hemocyte mortality and ROS significantly increased, peaking after 30 h at 5 and 10°C, followed by a gradual decrease over the subsequent 24 h recovery period. THC and ROS levels remained higher than the control levels by the end of the recovery period. The parameters investigated in this study could serve as indicators for the effects on the functional immune response and physiological stress of abalone during live transportation. © 2019 Journal of Shellfish Research.

In this 90-day study, growth and feed utilisation of juvenile (1.82 g) greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) fed diets containing graded dietary inclusion levels of Acti-Meal (0 basal, 5, 10, 15 and 20%) were examined. Four replicates were allocated per treatment with 15 abalone per tank and abalone were fed to excess daily. All experimental diets were formulated to contain 35% crude protein, 5% crude lipid and 17.5 MJ kg−1 gross energy. In addition, a commercial diet was also fed to abalone and compared with the 0% diet. Growth and feed utilisation of greenlip abalone fed the commercial diet and the 0% basal diet were similar. Greenlip abalone fed any Acti-Meal inclusion level (5, 10, 15 and 20%) exhibited significantly superior growth to abalone fed the 0% basal diet. Notably, in comparison to the basal diet, specific growth rate and biomass gain were improved by 5 to 6% and 10 to 12% respectively. The improvements were achieved despite greenlip abalone consuming significantly less feed (~9%) when fed the Acti-Meal diets. Greenlip abalone fed diets with Acti-Meal also exhibited superior apparent feed conversion ratios compared to those fed the 0% basal diet, on average FCRs were reduced by 13%. We recommend dietary inclusions of up to 20% Acti-Meal to improve greenlip abalone growth. We also recommend an on-farm growth trial to validate this product. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.08.074,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052879373

A total of 1470 juvenile abalone were distributed into 21 70-L plastic rectangular containers. Six experimental diets in triplicate were prepared, and 20% FM was included in the FM0 diet. The treatments consisted of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% of FM substituted with tunic meal of SS, referred to as the FM20, FM40, FM60, FM80, and FM100 diets, respectively. Undaria was also prepared to compare the effect of the formulated diets on performance of abalone. The experimental diets were fed to abalone once a day at a satiation level for 16 wk. Weight gain of abalone fed the FM0 diet was higher than that of abalone fed the FM100 diet and Undaria, but not different from that of abalone fed the FM80 diet. Crude protein, crude lipid, and ash contents of the soft body of abalone fed all formulated diets were higher than those of abalone fed the Undaria diet. In conclusion, FM up to 80% could be replaced with tunic meal of SS without retardation in growth of abalone.

A focus of this research has been the nacreous inner layer of the shell with its conspicuous arrangement of aragonite platelets, resembling in cross-section a brick-and-mortar wall. In comparison, the outer, less stable, calcitic prismatic layer has received much less attention. One of the first molluscan shell proteins to be characterized at the molecular level was Lustrin A, a component of the nacreous organic matrix of Haliotis rufescens. This was soon followed by the C-type lectin perlucin and the growth factor-binding perlustrin, both isolated from H. laevigata nacre, and the crystal growth-modulating AP7 and AP24, isolated from H. rufescens nacre. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics was subsequently applied to to Haliotis biomineralization research with the analysis of the H. asinina shell matrix and yielded 14 different shell-associated proteins. That study was the most comprehensive for a Haliotis species to date. Methods: The shell proteomes of nacre and prismatic layer of the marine gastropod Haliotis laevigata were analyzed combining mass spectrometry-based proteomics and next generation sequencing. Results: We identified 297 proteins from the nacreous shell layer and 350 proteins from the prismatic shell layer from the green lip abalone H. laevigata. Considering the overlap between the two sets we identified a total of 448 proteins. Fifty-one nacre proteins and 43 prismatic layer proteins were defined as major proteins based on their abundance at more than 0.2% of the total. The remaining proteins occurred at low abundance and may not play any significant role in shell fabrication. The overlap of major proteins between the two shell layers was 17, amounting to a total of 77 major proteins. Conclusions: The H. laevigata shell proteome shares moderate sequence similarity at the protein level with other gastropod, bivalve and more distantly related invertebrate biomineralising proteomes. Features conserved in H. laevigata and other molluscan shell proteomes include short repetitive sequences of low complexity predicted to lack intrinsic three-dimensional structure, and domains such as tyrosinase, chitin-binding, and carbonic anhydrase. This catalogue of H. laevigata shell proteins represents the most comprehensive for a haliotid and should support future efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of shell assembly. © 2018 The Author(s).",10.1186/s12953-018-0139-3,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048642906

This experiment evaluated the effect of organic selenium on the growth, antioxidation, immunity and gene expressions of selenoproteins in abalone. Graded levels of organic selenium were included to the basal diet at 0.00, 0.15, 0.30 and 0.60 ppm providing 157.83, 322.51, 437.59 and 596.59 ug/kg of selenium in the diet. Accordingly, the diets were named as Se-0.00, Se-0.15, Se-0.30 and Se-0.60 respectively. Results had shown that survival rate, weight gain rate and shell length increase rate were lowest for Se-0.60 group (p < 0.05). The concentration of selenium in the whole body generally increased with increasing level of dietary organic selenium (p < 0.05). The enzyme activities related to antioxidation increased initially with low levels of dietary selenium and decreased with higher levels, with the highest value in Se-0.30 group (p < 0.05). The enzyme activities of immunity increased with the addition of dietary selenium. With the increase of dietary selenium, Myostain expression decreased initially and increased afterwards, with lowest value for Se-0.30 group (p < 0.05). However, the expressions of other genes related to growth, antioxidation and selenoproteins firstly increased and then decreased, with the highest value recorded for Se-0.15 group. In conclusion, the inclusion rate of 0.15 – 0.30 ppm Se in diet could promote growth, antioxidation, immunity and gene expressions of selenoproteins in abalone; however, excess selenium with 0.60 ppm inclusion lever in diet had toxic effects. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/are.13956,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059262413

We studied the morphology and function of the epithelium in the giant keyhole limpet Megathura crenulata. All exposed surfaces of the limpets were covered by a mucus-secreting, simple columnar epithelium, in which most cells on the sole of the foot bore cilia, while the majority of cells on the side of the foot and three mantle regions bore microvilli. None of the coatings had antibacterial properties. The epithelium of the foot was distinct from that of other regions, in that the mucus secreted was used for locomotion and was left behind as the limpet moved. The glycocalyx bound to the microvilli of the mantle cells appeared to be clean in visual and SEM examinations, and attempts to enhance the binding of inert particles and bacteria were unsuccessful. Because studies have shown that standard tissue processing may cause artifactual shrinkage of mucous layers, cryostat sections and additives to standard fixatives were tested, but we found no change in the thickness of the mucous layers of the limpets compared to routinely processed tissues. Sloughing of the glycocalyx in vertebrate systems removes bound microbes, and alterations of the glycocalyx layers are associated with disease conditions. Sloughing of the glycocalyx on limpets was rarely observed. In one case, the outer mantle of the limpet was covered with silt and the glycocalyx appeared to be detaching. This process could be experimentally induced by dousing the outer mantle with talc particles. The types of secretory cells producing the mucus in each region of the skin were characterized using standard histological stains and lectin staining. Because analysis was hampered by their small size, classification of the types of secretory cells was based on TEM descriptions of granule morphology, which allowed for comparison to the secretory cells described from skin of the abalone. The possible roles of the numerous secretions, and the mechanisms of mucus production and loss, are compared to what is known in vertebrate systems and to our relative lack of knowledge regarding invertebrate systems. © 2018, The American Microscopical Society, Inc.",10.1111/ivb.12213,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048746664
Huang D.; Lei Y.; Xu W.; Zhang Y.; Zhou H.; Zhang W.; Mai K.,Protective effects of dietary α-lipoic acid on abalone Haliotis discus hannai against the oxidative damage under waterborne cadmium stress,2019,Aquaculture Nutrition,25,2,263,270,,"A 60-day feeding trial was conducted to investigate the protective effects of dietary α-lipoic acid (LA) on juvenile abalone Haliotis discus hannai against the oxidative damage under waterborne cadmium (Cd) stress. Three experimental diets were formulated with 0 (Control), 700 (LA-700) and 2100 (LA-2100) mg/kg supplement of LA respectively. Each diet was randomly assigned to three replicates of 50 abalones (initial body weight: 3.17 ± 0.01 g), which were exposed to 0.35 mg/L of waterborne Cd. Results showed that abalones’ Cd bioaccumulation in the serum, mantle, gill, muscle and hepatopancreas were significantly reduced in LA supplement groups. Besides, in hepatopancreas, the activities of antioxidative enzymes and concentration of glutathione (GSH) in LA supplement group were significantly higher than those in control. Meanwhile, in hepatopancreas, LA-2100 group showed a significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and the protein carbonyls in LA supplement groups were significantly lower than those in control. Diets with LA supplementation significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of HdhMTF-1 (H. discus hannai metal-responsive transcription factor-1) and HdhMT (H. discus hannai metallothionein), and elevated metallothionein (MT) concentrations in hepatopancreas. In conclusion, it was suggested that dietary LA could alleviate Cd-induced oxidative damage through enhancing antioxidative enzyme activities and upregulating the HdhMTF-1-mediated HdhMT transcription and synthesis. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/anu.12849,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056157238

Various combinations of red algae (Palmaria palmata, Ceramium rubrum and Chondrus crispus cultured or harvested from the natural environment, as well as Porphyra spp. collected), brown algae (Laminaria digitata) and green algae (fresh or frozen Ulva intestinalis) were tested. The results showed that P. palmata, C. rubrum and U. intestinalis administered alone were associated with significantly higher weight growth rates than the other species of algae tested. However, some combinations of algae (i.e. different proportions of L. digitata in association with P. palmata) were more favorable for weight increase when compared with the expected rates calculated for the diet based on L. digitata alone. Limiting the amount of any of these foods substantially reduced the conversion rate. Seasonal trends were apparent in both weight increase and food conversion rates, with the result that growth in weight on a diet of L. digitata was fastest in summer. Growth on P. palmata was faster in each season, and reached a maximum in early spring. The data collected allowed us to model weight increase and month-to-month food conversion rates for a diet based on P. palmata and L. digitata. The data obtained in this study were coupled with data regarding the availability of algae during the year, enabling us to suggest an optimal diet for each of the four seasons. Finally, the effects of different algae diets were investigated on hemocyte parameters, and the result suggested that P. palmata would reinforce the immune system of abalone. © EDP Sciences 2018.",10.1051/alr/2018018,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054977533

Water stability of the experimental diets was measured 12, 24, and 48 h after seawater immersion. Crude protein, L and ash content of the experimental diets decreased with time. Survival of abalone fed the C48:L2 diet was higher than that of abalone fed the C49:L1 and C41:L9 diets. Weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone fed the C49:L1, C48:L2, and C47:L3 diets were higher than that of abalone fed the C45:L5, C43:L7, and C41:L9 diets. Crude L content of the soft body of abalone was directly reflected from dietary crude L content. In conclusion, the optimal dietary C : L ratio was estimated to be 48:2 and 47:3 based on survival, weight gain, and SGR of juvenile abalone, respectively.

Abalone fisheries are mainly seen in Wando on the south coast of Korea, where seaweed aquaculture has been majorly conducted. Mass mortality of abalone spats is considered a major problem in abalone fisheries and is caused by changes in environmental factors and food availability (including availability of benthic diatoms). However, it is difficult to supply sufficient quantities of benthic diatoms to post-larvae abalone. Therefore, we explored the development of growth-promoting substances for diatoms Navicula sp. and experimentally mixed several substances to enhance the growth of diatoms. In this study, we used alginic acid, fucoidan, Scytosiphon lomentaria, Ecklonia cava, Ecklonia cava processing byproduct (i.e., Ecklonia cava–boiled extracts, EBE), and Porphyra tenera. In addition, EBE, phosphate fertilizer (PF), nitrogenous manure (NM), and sodium silicate (SS) were mixed to determine the optimal composition of growth substances. The growth of diatoms significantly increased under EBE exposure, compared with other substances. During this study, attempts were made to identify the optimal composition of mixtures of PF, NM, and SS with that of EBE (1:1:1:1). The Navicula sp. growth-promoting substance (NGPS) mixture enhanced Navicula sp. growth by 150% compared with existing market products. We were therefore able to develop a substance that promotes the growth of diatoms, thereby facilitating the cultivation of healthy abalone with reduced mortality. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/s10499-019-00391-5,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068148926

Enrichment analysis identified some noteworthy GO terms (cellular process and response to stimulus) and pathways (protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and apoptotic signaling pathways), and these were further analyzed. Analysis showed that genes indicative of mitochondrial damage were upregulated; DNA damage formation, and fatty acid and amino acid synthesis increased; fatty acid decomposition reduced; and misfolded proteins accumulated in the ER, and the unfolded protein response and ER-associated degradation were triggered to relieve ER stress. In addition, the apoptotic pathway was activated; however, some genes associated with anti-apoptosis and molecular chaperones were upregulated to maintain homeostasis after heat stress.

Dietary inclusion effect of the combined macroalgae (MA) (Undaria pinnatifida and Hizikia fusiforme) and a single Saccharina japonica on abalone was also compared. Three thousand six hundred juvenile abalone were purchased from a private hatchery and acclimated to the experimental conditions for 2weeks. Six 5-ton flow-through raceway tanks were used, and abalone were randomly distributed into tanks (n=600 per tank). Three experimental diets were prepared in duplicate. Fish meal, FSM, corn gluten meal, and shrimp meal and wheat flour and dextrin were used as the protein and carbohydrate sources, respectively, in the FSM diet. MA was also included in the FSM diet. FSM and MA in the FSM diet were substituted with SBM at the expense of wheat flour and S. japonica, referred to as the SBM and SJ diets. The experimental diets were pelletized by an extruded pelleter. Water stability of nutrients in the experimental diets was monitored at 12, 24, and 48h after seawater immersion. The experimental diets were fed to abalone once a day to satiation with a little leftover for 120days. The retained crude protein and lipid and ash content of the extruded pellets were changed over all period of time. Weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone fed the SBM diet were greater than those of abalone fed the FSM and SJ diets. Weight gain and SGR of abalone fed the SJ diet were also greater than those of abalone fed the FSM diet. The longest shell length, widest shell width, highest shell height, and greatest soft body weight were obtained in abalone fed the SBM diet, followed by the SJ and FSM diets. Proximates of the soft body of abalone were not different among the experimental diets. In conclusion, SBM was a superior protein source to FSM in extruded pellet for growth performance of abalone.

Lampert K.P.,Oxygen concentration drives local adaptation in the greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata),2018,Molecular Ecology,27,7,1521,1523,,"Understanding adaptation has become one of the major biological questions especially in the light of rapid environmental changes induced by climate change. Ocean temperatures are rising which triggers massive changes in water chemistry and thereby alters the living environment of all marine organisms. Studying adaptation, however, can be tricky because spatial genetic patterns might also occur due to random effects, for example, genetic drift. Genetic drift is reduced in very large and well-connected populations, such as in broadcast marine spawning organisms. Here, spatial genetic divergence is likely to be produced by selection. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Sandoval-Castillo et al. (2018) investigated patterns of spatial genetic divergence and their association with environmental factors in the greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata). This commercially important species of mollusc is a broadcast spawner with large population sizes, rendering genetic drift an unlikely factor in the genetic divergence of wild populations. Sandoval-Castillo et al. (2018) used a ddRAD genomic approach to test for genetic divergence between sampled populations while also measuring different environmental factors, for example, water temperature and oxygen content. The majority of identified SNPs was putatively neutral and showed only low levels of genetic divergence between field sites. However, 323 candidate adaptive markers were identified that clearly separated the individuals into five different clusters. These genetic clusters correlated with environmental clusters mainly determined by water temperature and (correlated) oxygen concentration. Gene annotation of the candidate SNPs revealed a large proportion of loci being involved in biological processes influenced by oxygen availability. The study by Sandoval-Castillo et al. (2018) in this issue of Molecular Ecology exemplifies the benefits of combining genomic studies with ecological data. It is a great starting point for more detailed (gene function, physiology) as well as broader (biodiversity) investigations that might help us to better understand adaptation and predict ecosystems’ resilience and resistance to environmental disturbances. In addition, this information can be applied to implement optimal conservation regime policies and sustainable harvesting strategies, hopefully protecting biodiversity as well as commercial interests in marine life. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",10.1111/mec.14563,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059897206

After August, the persistence of the thalli of Sugwawon No. 301 was two months longer than that of Huangguan No. 1. We found that the Sugwawon No. 301 performed as well as the Huangguan No. 1 in Korean waters possibly due to increased flexibility as a result of the different cell arrangements of the two cultivars. Overall, the use of the Sugwawon No. 301 cultivar rather than the Huangguan No. 1 cultivar of S. japonica appears the best alternative to help to ensure a stable year round algal feed supply for the Korean abalone industry. © 2018 The Korean Society of Phycology.",10.4490/algae.2018.33.2.4,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044338097

The quality properties of baked abalone (150–210 °C, 10–30 min) with and without pre-tenderization treatment prior to baking were evaluated through sensory evaluation, textural analysis and Hunter Lab colorimeter. In addition, amounts of sugars and α-dicarbonyl compounds in these products were determined via HPLC analyses. The baking condition at 180 °C for 20 min combined with pre-tenderization resulted in an optimal product. The baked abalone with pre-tenderization had better textural properties (hardness, 1031.12 ± 101.67; springiness, 0.96 ± 0.02; chewiness, 817.13 ± 113.43; shear, 2843.92 ± 35.67), sensory scores (30.1 ± 2.9) and color (25.28 ± 1.21) as compared to the baked abalone without pre-tenderization (hardness, 1990.91 ± 252.35; springiness, 0.87 ± 0.01; chewiness, 1164.43 ± 195.64; shear, 3910.79 ± 302.12; sensory score, 17.4 ± 1.0; color, 15.91 ± 0.74). The reducing sugar analysis indicated the presence of ribose and glucose in the baked abalone. In addition, the formation of α-dicarbonyl compounds (degraded from reducing sugars) including glucosone, 3-deoxyglucosone, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and diacetyl were significantly promoted by the tenderization process in the baked abalone muscle. And the tenderization treatment led to an average of 218% increase in α-dicarbonyl compounds in the baked abalone muscle. The promotion of the formation of α-dicarbonyl compounds by the tenderization treatment contributed to the accumulation of pigments in the final baked products and led to desirable color. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s11694-018-9765-9,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044070193

A method of isotope dilution with high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was used to determine TCS and five paraben analogues, including methyl paraben (MeP), ethyl paraben (EtP), propyl paraben (PrP), butyl paraben (BuP), and benzyl paraben (BeP), in 186 shellfish samples covering eight species. Concentrations of parabens and TCS were 0.13–25.5 ng/g wet weight (ww) and <LOQ–6.51 ng/g ww, respectively, indicating their ubiquitous contamination in Shenzhen coastal waters. MeP was the most predominant paraben, followed by EtP and PrP. These three analogues accounted for more than 95% of the total concentrations of parabens. The “high” estimated daily intakes of parabens and TCS with the 95th percentage concentrations were estimated to be 2.15–26.1 and 0.41–10.3 ng/kg bw/day, respectively, much lower than the acceptable dietary intakes of parabens (1 × 107 ng/kg bw/day) and TCS (200 ng/kg bw/day), indicating no significant human health risks from shellfish consumption in the studied region.

At the end of the experiment, the survival rate and specific growth rate of weight of abalones in the high-density group were 86.5% and 0.14 mg d− 1, respectively, which were significantly lower than those in the low- and medium-density groups (P < 0.05). The food intake of abalones in the low-density group was significantly higher than that in the medium- and high-density groups (P < 0.05). At days 60 and 90, the food conversion efficiency of abalones in the medium-density group had declined, but it still was significantly higher than that in the high-density group (P < 0.05). At the end of the experiment, the moisture and lactic acid contents of abalones in the high-density group were significantly higher than those in the low-density group. The protein content in the medium-density group decreased over time and became significantly lower than that in the low-density group at day 90 (P < 0.05). The activities of pepsin and cellulase were significantly higher in the low- and medium-density groups than in the high-density group (P < 0.05). At days 60 and 90, the activity of α-amylase in the low-density group was significantly higher than that in the medium-density group (P < 0.05). At the end of the experiment, the expression levels of the polysaccharide cleavage enzyme genes Hdaly and Hdamyl in the low-density group had increased and were significantly higher than those in the medium- and high-density groups (P < 0.05). The expression level of Hdlam in the high-density group was significantly lower than that in the medium-density group (P < 0.05), whereas the expression level of Hdcel in the medium-density group was significantly lower than that in the low-density group (P < 0.05). At the end of the experiment, the expression levels of catalase and glutathione S-transferase in the high-density group were significantly higher than levels in the medium- and low-density groups (P < 0.05). Overall, although food was readily available in this study, abalones had to first search for food and then spend time feeding and ingesting it. For some individuals, such as those in the corners of the tank or under a stack of other abalones, access to food was restricted. Moreover, extra energy expenditure was required to resist oxidative damage. These were the main reasons for the observed slowdown of abalone growth and the increased mortality rate observed in this study. © 2017",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.07.005,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031041234

QdNOs are reported to exhibit cytotoxicity, photoallergy, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity activities. To monitor for contamination of QdNOS in abalone and assess dietary exposure, a simple and reliable analytical method for the detection of QdNOs and their major metabolites was developed. Results: This work is the first to present a simple and fast pretreatment procedure coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography tandem positive-mode electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) for tracing of major metabolites of QdNOs in abalone. Extraction steps were simplified by the use of methanol and ethyl acetate containing 0.1% formic acid instead of more complicated acidolysis and enzymolysis pretreatment procedures. High-sensitive characters were obtained with limits of detection ranged from 0.16 to 2.1 μg kg−1 for QdNOs and their major metabolites. Conclusion: These results indicate that the LC–MS/MS method developed could be applied for QdNOs and major metabolites detection in actual samples. Considering the large production and consumption of abalone in Shandong Province, China, this work will also contribute to the further understanding of the often-ignored exposure pathway of QdNOs. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry",10.1002/jsfa.9819,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068124665

A major risk factor for this sector is slow growth rates experienced during farming. Abalone feeds are often supplemented with amino acids in an attempt to enhance abalone growth. This is a first investigation of the effect of added proline to standard abalone feed, on the metabolite profile of slow-growing abalone. A targeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics research approach was followed to recognise the metabolic response of abalone showing slower growth performance. The addition of proline to the standard abalone diet was found to serve as a substrate for amino acid catabolism in slower growing abalone, by means of proline breakdown to assist with energy production via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Other amino acids and urea cycle intermediates, that is, arginine, asparagine, ornithine and creatine further support energy production via the action of protein catabolism in slow-growing abalone. Additionally, the importance of understanding how abalone respond metabolically to modified feed highlights the use of metabolomics to answer abalone aquaculture farming questions. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/are.13978,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061602749

In this study, instead of extracting polysaccharides (PUs) from U. prolifera, algae powder was used directly as the primary carbon source in a fermentation medium. Five percent (5%) algae powder was more conducive to fermentation. Using submerged liquid fermentation, the soluble components of U. prolifera were released efficiently in a 50-L fermenter. Levels of mannitol acquired using submerged liquid fermentation were 1.8 times higher than those acquired using the hot-water method, and polysaccharides were efficiently hydrolyzed to form oligosaccharides with an average molecular weight of approximately 3300 Da. Furthermore, a 2-month experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of U. prolifera fermentation extracts on the growth performance of juvenile abalone (Haliotis discus hannai Ino). Diets containing algae fermentation extracts in concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 1% significantly increased linear shell growth rate (LGR), weight growth rate (WGR), and specific growth rate (SGR). Diets supplemented with fermentation extracts in concentrations of 0.5 and 1% significantly increased the degree of green coloration in the shell. Treatment of algae tissue using submerged liquid fermentation has the advantages of high efficiency and convenient process monitoring.

The loco is present along the coast of Chile, in theArchipelago of Juan Fernández and in southern and central Perú, and its range of distribution spans over 5,000 km of intertidal and shallow subtidal reefs. In Chile, the loco is a traditional food resource and has been heavily exploited since the early Holocene by intertidal food-gathers and free divers, and since the 1950s/60s by a small-scale artisan fleet of hookah-divers. In Chile, since the mid-1970s, the species has been mainly exported (foot-meat) to Asian markets, and between 1976 and 1980 market demands acted as a major driving force behind overexploitation of the loco. Since the 1990s, its fishery moved from an open access regime to a comanagement regulated policy based on territorial user rights for fisheries (TURF) and reproductive fishery bans. The loco, as an iconic species, played a key role in the implementation of TURF. In Perú, the loco fishery operates under a reproductive ban fishery regime and its export started in the late 1990s. In Chile, the loco is by far the most intensely studied of all exploited shellfishes in terms of evolution, paleobiogeography, biogeography, life history, behavior, physiology, ecology, genetics, and fishery. Moreover, the loco has been used as a biological model to study responses to global stressors such as ocean warming and acidification. During the past 20 y, several laboratory experimental attempts have been made to advance experimental, pilot, and commercial aquaculture of the loco. Nevertheless, the available information shows that no reliable and repeatable pilot or massive aquaculture protocols have yet succeeded. In this study, the extensive field and laboratory information for the most relevant life history phases of the loco, such as reproduction, mating, brood-stock holding, egg capsule deposition, larval posthatching, growing to competence, larval feeding, settlement and metamorphosis to juvenile stages, and pilot growing experiences to adult sizes are reviewed. In light of the available information, the most critical aquaculture bottlenecks are identified. Among them, the existence, from hatching to competence, of a long larval planktonic phase of about 3-4 mo, and the existence of cannibalism during postsettlement confined laboratory conditions are highlighted. Moreover, key aspects of the larval rearing of the loco, such as densities, field and laboratory food items, and temperatures are reported. The field collection of (1) competent larvae of locos in inshore coastal plankton; (2) new settlers from rocky shores; and (3) new settlers from fishery-discarded conspecific shells are also discussed. The collection of competent larvae was followed by laboratory induction to settlement and by two consecutive postsettlement rearing/growing phases (laboratory and field conditions) to overcome difficulties associated with the long larval phase and to speed up the time required to reach trading sizes. Furthermore, collection of new settlers was followed by rearing experiments under both laboratory and field conditions. The need of high demands of live prey (mainly mussels) during the laboratory rearing of the early benthic stages of loco is discussed, emphasizing that to implement ecologically sustainable aquaculture practices, parallel aquaculture of the appropriated prey is needed. A review of what is already known regarding the biology of C. concholepas is provided along with progress and pit-falls for the aquaculture of this species. The practicality for its aquaculture and the main challenges ahead are also discussed. © 2018 National Shellfisheries Association.

Abalones, a type of single-shelled gastropod, are the most important commercial species in shellfish cultivation in Indonesia. To evaluate the potential ecological risks posed by temperature stress, we measured biological responses such as survival rates, mucus production, muscle hardness and histologically foot muscle abnormalities in Haliotis squamata. In addition, biochemical responses and gene expression profile were also evaluated in the exposed experiment to various temperature gradients. Thermal shock was carried out in 4 rectangular glasses aquarium (100 L). Abalones were divided into four groups for temperature treatment, in triplicates. The temperature treatments ware adjusted to 28, 30, 32 and 34°C in advance. Every aquarium contained 3 pcs of 20 cm long 3"" PVC pipe for rearing 30 abalones 32.97±1.83 mm per PVC. Following 4 days of temperature exposure, the dead abalones were collected from each aquarium, after which the number of surviving abalones in each aquarium was recorded. These results represented the survivorship at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Abalone hemolymph were collected randomly by 1 mL 25 gauge microsyring at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 96 hours. The hemolymph samples were stored in -20°C until analyzed. Increase in temperature stress triggers more mucus production and hardness of the muscle and abnormal foot muscle structure. Furthermore, antioxidant enzyme activity increased in abalone exposed to relatively lower and higher temperatures (28, 32 and 32°C). Super oxide dismutase, catalase and phenol oxidase activity were determined in a time-dependent manner after high temperature pressure. Generally, production of heat shock 70 and 90 proteins also increased significantly in H. squamata which were treated in temperatures gradient (more than 30°C) for 6-12 hours.

Haliotrema is a genus of the family Dactylogyridae. Species of this genus have very interesting host associations and geographic distributions. The aim of this study was to report on occurrences of exotic Haliotrema aurigae in diseased Rainford butterflyfish that were imported to Brazil. One Rainford’s butterflyfish with suspected parasitic disease was euthanized and subjected to skin and gill scraping. The parasite specimens were mounted on semi-permanent slides with Hoyer’s solution for morphological analysis of sclerotized structures. The hard-sclerotized structures of these specimens were compared and were identified as those of Haliotrema aurigae (Yamaguti, 1968). These results emphasize the importance of implementation of correct control measures at the country’s borders, to avoid the introduction of exotic parasites.

The gut bacterial communities of abalone species characterized so far reveal considerable interspecific variability, likely resulting from bacterial interactions and constrained by the ecology of their abalone host species; however, they remain poorly investigated. Additionally, the extent to which structural changes in the microbiota entail functional shifts in metabolic pathways of bacterial communities remains unexplored. In order to address these questions, we characterized the gut microbiota of the northeast Pacific blue (Haliotis fulgens or HF) and yellow (Haliotis corrugata or HC) abalone by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to shed light on: (i) their gut microbiota structure; (ii) how bacteria may interact among them; and (iii) predicted shifts in bacterial metabolic functions associated with the observed structural changes. Our findings revealed that Mycoplasma dominated the GI microbiome in both species. However, the structure of the bacterial communities differed significantly in spite of considerable intraspecific variation. This resulted from changes in predominant species composition in each GI microbiota, suggesting host-specific adaptation of bacterial lineages to these sympatric abalone. We hypothesize that the presence of exclusive OTUs in each microbiota may relate to host-specific differences in competitive pressure. Significant differences in bacterial diversity were found between species for the explored metabolic pathways despite their functional overlap. A more diverse array of bacteria contributed to each function in HC, whereas a single or much fewer OTUs were generally observed in HF. The structural and functional analyses allowed us to describe a significant taxonomic split and functional overlap between the microbiota of HF and HC abalone.

Both genetic breeding programs and improvements in cultivation techniques have contributed to this advancement. However, no published data have ever distinguished the progress contributed by genetic breeding from the gross advancement. We compared the offspring growth and survival among a wild and a selected strain (AO) of the Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) and their hybrids (wild♀ × AO♂) and tried to distinguish the advancement provided by genetic breeding. The offspring metamorphosis rate, growth and survival of the selected strain of the Pacific abalone were superior to those of the wild strain. In the artificial diet feeding phase, the offspring shell growth and survival rates of the selected strain were >17% and 30% higher than those of the wild stain, respectively. In the overwintering phase, the offspring shell growth, wet weight growth and survival rates were >28%, 50% and 35% higher than those of the wild stain, respectively. Although the oocytes were from the same source, the hybrids showed a superior performance compared to the purebred wild strain, especially in the metamorphosis phase, which also indicated the progress made by the selected strain in adapting to the culturing conditions.

Further development of the sector will affect the provision of ecosystem services that maintain the livelihood of local populations. In particular, the current size and growth rate of China's mariculture has raised many environmental concerns, but very few studies of this sector have been conducted to date. Here, we report the resource use in the production of six main Chinese mariculture products (Larimichthys crocea, Apostichopus japonicus, Haliotis spp., Laminaria japonica, Gracilaria spp., Porphyra spp.), taking the city of Ningde as a case study. We used the life cycle assessment framework and the Cumulated Exergy Demand indicator to quantify resource use, and implemented a Monte Carlo simulation where model uncertainty was included using various methods. The mean exergy demand values of the production of one live-weight ton of large yellow croaker, sea cucumber, abalone, laminaria, gracilaria, and porphyra are 106 GJ eq., 65 GJ eq., 126 GJ eq., 0.25 GJ eq., 1.55 GJ eq., and 0.98 GJ eq., respectively. For animal products, 45-90% of the impacts come from the feed requirements, while in seaweed production, 83-99% of the impacts are linked to the fuel used in operation and maintenance activities. Policies oriented toward efficient resource management in the mariculture sector thus should take the farm design, input management, and spatial planning of marine areas as the main targets to guide current practices into more sustainable ones in the future. Improvements in all those aspects can effectively increase resource efficiency in local mariculture production and additionally reduce other environmental impacts both locally and globally. © 2019 by the authors.",10.3390/su11051396,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062817276

In the present study, two MyD88 variants were identified from disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) and designated AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X. The deduced AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X comprised 433 and 354 amino acids with predicted molecular masses of 48.85 kDa and 40.17 kDa, respectively. AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X possessed typical MyD88 domain structural features including an N-terminal death domain (DD) and C-terminal toll interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain similar to those in mammals. Expression analysis of AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X mRNA at different early embryonic developmental stages of abalone by qPCR revealed that their constitutive expression at all developmental stages analyzed with the considerably higher values at the 16-cell (AbMyD88-2) and morula stages (AbMyD88-X). In unchallenged disk abalones, AbMyD88-2 was highly expressed in muscles, while AbMyD88-X mRNA was predominantly transcribed in hemocytes.

Overexpression of AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X in HEK293T cells induced the activation of the NF-κB promoter. AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X involvement in inflammatory responses was characterized by their overexpression in RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells. These results revealed comparatively higher NO (Nitric oxide) production, induction of inflammatory mediator genes (iNOS and COX2), and proinflammatory genes (IL1β, IL6 and TNFα) expression in abalone MyD88s-overexpressing cells than in mock control in the presence or absence of LPS stimulation. Altogether, these results suggest that existence of a MyD88-dependent like signaling pathway in disk abalone and that both AbMyD88-2 and AbMyD88-X might be involved in innate immune and inflammatory responses. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.dci.2017.10.010,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032701901

This study showed that sulfated polysaccharides of abalone gonad (AGSP) inhibited weight gain and fat accumulation in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. AGSP treatment via intragastric gavage exhibited a better inhibitory effect on some obesity-related parameters in comparison with free diet. AGSP via two different patterns improved HFD-induced metabolic syndrome and gut microbiota dysbiosis, but some differences between them at the higher taxonomic levels resulted in a specific gut microbiota, which could affect nutrient utilization and energy metabolism and lead to a slight difference in its beneficial action. Taken together, this study can provide a guidance for the practical application of prebiotic polysaccharides in daily life. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.03.174,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063467228

The present study investigates the effect of elevated temperature on hatching rate, growth and survival of larvae and breeders of tropical mollusk, donkey’s ear abalone (Haliotis asinina). Different life stages of abalone were exposed to the following temperature treatments: ambient (29°C), +2°C (31°C), and +4°C (33°C). Hatching rate was significantly reduced when the fertilized eggs were incubated at temperature 4°C above ambient. Increase in temperature at 2°C above ambient can significantly influence the survival of larvae. Significant decline in the survival was observed when the larvae were exposed at temperatures 31°C and 33°C, however bigger larvae were observed in groups reared at 31°C, while those larvae that were reared in 33°C were significantly smaller. Furthermore, reduced growth, feeding rate and survival were also observed in breeders reared at elevated temperature. The result of the study suggests that early developmental stages and reproducing adult abalone were vulnerable to the impact of climate change. © 2017, BIOFLUX SRL, All rights reserved.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037660176

Both viruses cause diseases associated with high mortality rates, resulting in dramatic economic losses in the aquaculture industry. There are currently no effective treatments for either of these two viral diseases. Thus, early, rapid, and accurate diagnosis plays a fundamental role in disease prevention and control in aquaculture. Traditional methods of diagnosis, such as virus culture, enzyme-linked immunoassay, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are either time consuming or require sophisticated temperature control devices. In this study, one sets of specific primers and probes were designed for the real-time quantitative recombinase polymerase amplification (qRPA) detection of AbHV and RGNNV separately. The sensitivity and specificity of detection were evaluated by comparison with detection by conventional PCR and quantitative PCR. The optimal reaction temperature and time for virus detection is 37 °C for 20 min. The detection limit is 100 copies per reaction, making this approach faster and more sensitive than qPCR in this study. In a field application, the detection percentage of qRPA was higher than that of qPCR for both AbHV and NNV. Additionally, good correlation was found between qRPA and qPCR detection (R2 > 0.8). The methods presented here can be used as alternatives to qPCR for quick and quantitative detection of pathogens infecting aquaculture species. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.09.024,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032860565
Rick T.C.; Braje T.J.; Erlandson J.M.,"Early red abalone shell middens, human subsistence, and environmental change on California's Northern channel Islands",2019,Journal of Ethnobiology,39,2,204,222,,"Red abalone (Haliots rufescens) shell middens, a distinctive site type on the California Coast dating primarily to the Middle Holocene, provide important insight into human-environmental interactions and climatic and environmental change. Despite decades of research and debate about why red abalone middens formed and how they relate to past human behavior and environmental change, significant questions persist about the nature of these sites and how they relate to broader trends in human diet and land use. Here, we present the results of excavation at three red abalone middens on the northern Channel Islands. Two of these middens, CA-SRI-26 on Santa Rosa Island and CA-SMI-692 on San Miguel Island, are among the older reported red abalone middens, at roughly 8000-7300 cal BP, and help fill a significant temporal gap in our understanding of the initial period of intensive red abalone harvest. The third midden, CA-SMI-172, dates to ~6300 cal BP and fills a spatial gap on eastern San Miguel Island. When placed in the context of other Channel Island red abalone middens, our analysis demonstrates that people at some of the earliest red abalone middens harvested more red abalone and larger sized individuals than later in time. These data suggest that people likely placed predation pressure on red abalones across the red abalone midden period (8500-3500 cal BP) and that human activities worked in tandem with other environmental changes to influence the disappearance of the red abalone midden phenomenon ~3500 years ago. © 2019 E-flow BioOne.

The larvae was exposed to different pCO2 conditions; constant [450, 800, or 1200 μatm in the first experiment (Exp. I), 450 or 780 μatm in the second experiment (Exp. II)] or diurnally fluctuating pCO2 (800 ± 400 or 1200 ± 400 μatm in Exp. I, 450 ± 80, 780 ± 200 or 780 ± 400 μatm in Exp. II). Mortality, malformation rates or shell length of larval abalone were not significantly different among the 450, 800, and 800 ± 400 μatm pCO2 treatments. Meanwhile, significantly higher malformation rates and smaller shells were detected in the 1200 and 1200 ± 400 μatm pCO2 treatments than in the 450 μatm pCO2 treatment. The negative impacts were greater in the 1200 ± 400 μatm than in the 1200 μatm. Shell length and malformation rate of larval abalone were related with aragonite saturation state (Ω-aragonite) in experimental seawater, and greatly changed around 1.1 of Ω-aragonite which corresponded to 1000–1300 μatm pCO2. These results indicate that there is a pCO2 threshold associated with Ω-aragonite in the seawater, and that pCO2 fluctuations produce additional negative impacts on abalone when above the threshold. Clear relationships were detected between abalone fitness and the integrated pCO2 value over the threshold, indicating that the effects of OA on development and shell formation of larval abalone can be determined by intensity and time of exposure to pCO2 over the threshold. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.marenvres.2017.12.015,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039153549

The genome of HaHV-1 has been sequenced, but the functions of the putative genes and their roles during infection are still poorly understood. In the present study, transcriptomic profiles of Haliotis diversicolor supertexta at 0, 24 and 60 h post injection (hpi) with HaHV-1 were characterized through high-throughput RNA sequencing. A total of 448 M raw reads were obtained and assembled into 2.08 × 105 unigenes with a mean length of 1486 bp and an N50 of 2455 bp. Although we detected increased HaHV-1 DNA loads and active viral expression at 24 hpi, this evidence was not linked to significant changes of host transcriptomic profiles between 0 and 24 hpi, whereas a rich immune-related gene set was over-expressed at 60 hpi. These results indicate that, at least at the beginning of HaHV-1 infection, the virus can replicate with no activation of the host immune response. We propose that HaHV-1 may evolve more effective strategies to modulate the host immune response and hide during replication, so that it could evade the immune surveillance at the early stage of infection. © 2019 by the authors.

This infection, caused by the rickettsial-like intracellular organism (RLO) Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis, can severely impair the normal development of affected animals, and ultimately, their survival. The most common line of action against the WS has been the use of antibiotics, specifically oxytetracycline (OTC), administered via intramuscular injection and per os via medicated feed. In the present study, we have assessed the effectiveness of OTC baths as therapeutic treatment for the control of the WS agent in H. rufescens. Clinical signs of infection were monitored for 11 months in treated juveniles, in addition to feed consumption rate, growth patterns and gonad development. Abalones were asymptomatic until the end of the experiment, when a small number of non-treated animals exhibited clinical signs of infection. Gonad maturity was not observed. OTC treated animals grew significantly less than their non-treated counterparts, being 4.3% shorter and 13.6% lighter at the end of the experiment. They also displayed negative allometry, i.e. for the same shell length, they were lighter than non-treated groups. Furthermore, the weight of muscle and soft tissues in OTC treated animals was lighter than in the other groups, while no differences were found in shell weight. The feed consumption rate was the same for all groups, thus the observed growth patterns cannot be attributed to a decreased feed intake. One possible explanation is that antibiotic treatment may have impacted gut microflora, thus preventing efficient nutrient digestion and absorption and, indirectly, reducing growth. Prevalence of RLOs causing WS (WS-RLO) and the variant form (RLOv), infected with a bacteriophague and non virulent, were significantly lower in the OTC-treated group than in the other groups. Similar results were observed for the mean intensity of RLOv, while for WS-RLO, the intensity in the OTC-treated group was higher, although not statistically significant, than the rest of the groups. These observations may be the consequence of an increased bacterial sensitivity to OTC effects associated with the phage infection or faster reproduction of WS-RLOs than RLOv after OTC treatment. Our results let us infer that the prophylactic use of OTC in abalone to avoid the negative effects of WS on abalone farms could have an undesired negative effect on the biological control exerted by the phage on the bacteria after OTC treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.jip.2018.02.019,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043227674

However, high temperatures have limited its growth and industrialization in the southern coast. The stress-resistant phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) is intimately related to chorismate metabolism. In this study, the transcriptional level of two chorismate metabolic enzymes, isochorismate synthase (ICS) and chorismate mutase (CM) from G. lemaneiformis, were used to analyze the effects of the addition of SA under two temperature conditions. Results showed that high temperature (33°C) and SA stimulated the transcriptional expression of the two enzymes, e.g., compared to the corresponding control, ics expression level ranged from 2.84 to 4.76 times at 23°C and from 1.25 to 1.62 times at 33°C after addition of SA within 3-12h; cm expression level increased to 2.73 times at 23°C and 1.82 times at 33°C at 24h. Then, the encoding genes of the two enzymes were transferred into pET28a vector, respectively, and the recombinant ICS and CM proteins were expressed largely in the inclusion bodies. The optimal induction conditions of the recombinant proteins were at 16°C for 24h by 0.1mmol/L IPTG. Finally, the recombinant proteins were preliminarily purified with a nickel column.

In vivo antioxidant activities of AVP were evaluated using a D-galactose induced oxidative damage mice model. Animals were divided into normal and model control groups, and low-, middle-, and high-dose groups (125, 250, and 500 mg/kg AVP), as well as GSH groups. In addition to the main component of protein, the AVP also contained 5.11% polysaccharide and a small amount of minerals. It was found that the peptide components at molecular weight of 180-500 u were main fractions. The hydrophobic amino acid and branched chain amino acid contents in the complete amino acids of AVP were 49.77% and 22.92%, respectively. The EC50 values of both hydroxyl and DPPH radical scavenging activity of AVP were 1. 54 mg/mL and 1.51 mg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the lipid peroxidation inhibitory effect of AVP was better than that of vitamin C. On the other hand, AVP could improve the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in serum and liver of the aging mice induced by D-galactose, decrease the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in serum, and attenuate the morphological damage in liver tissue.

In this study, we characterized two ferritin homologues in the red abalone Haliotis rufescens, a species of economic importance for Chile, USA and Mexico. Two ferritin subunits (Hrfer1 and Hrfer2) were cloned. Hrfer1 cDNA is an 807 bp clone containing a 516 bp open reading frame (ORF) that corresponds to a novel ferritin subunit in H. rufescens. Hrfer2 cDNA is an 868 bp clone containing a 516 bp ORF that corresponds to a previously reported ferritin subunit, but in this study 5′- and 3′-UTR sequences were additionally found. We detected a putative Iron Responsive Element (IRE) in the 5′-UTR sequence, suggesting a posttranscriptional regulation of Hrfer2 translation by iron. The deduced protein sequences of both cDNAs possessed the motifs and domains required in functional ferritin subunits. Expression patterns of both ferritins in different tissues, during different developmental stages, and in response to bacterial (Vibrio splendidus) exposure were examined. Both Hrfer1 and Hrfer2 are most expressed in digestive gland and gonad. Hrfer1 mRNA levels increased about 34-fold along with larval developmental process, attaining the highest level in the creeping post-larvae. Exogenous feeding is initiated at the creeping larva stage; thus, the increase of Hrfer1 may suggest and immunity-related role upon exposure to bacteria. Highest Hrfer2 expression levels were detected at trochophore stage; which may be related with early shell formation. Upon challenge with, the bacteria an early mild induction of Hrfer2 (2 h post-challenge), followed by a stronger induction of Hrfer1 at 15 h post-challenge, was observed in haemocytes from adult abalones. While maximal upregulation of both genes in the whole individual occurred at 24 h post-challenge, in juveniles. A significant increase in ferritin protein levels from 6 h to 24 h post-challenge was also detected. Our results suggest an involvement of Hrfer1 and Hrfer2, and of ferritin proteins in the immune response of H. rufescens to bacterial infection. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.fsi.2018.08.030,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051968488

The survival rate, total number of blood lymphocytes, activity of acid phosphatase, and expression level of heat shock protein 70 were significantly higher in B1, B2, and B3 than in C (P < 0.05). The specific growth rate of shell length, food intake, food conversion rate, phagocytic activity of blood lymphocytes, activities of myeloperoxidase and catalase (CAT), and expression levels of CAT and thioredoxin peroxidase of abalones in B2 were significantly higher than those in B1 and C (P < 0.05). Although the level of O2− produced by the respiratory burst of blood lymphocytes in B2 was not significantly different from those in B1 and B3, they were significantly higher than that in C (P < 0.05). The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), the nitric oxide levels produced by the respiratory burst of blood lymphocytes, and the expression levels of Mn-SOD in B1 and B3 were significantly higher than those in C but significantly lower than those in B2 (P < 0.05). Fourteen days after infection with V. parahaemolyticus, the cumulative mortality of abalones in B2 was significantly lower than those in B1 and C (P < 0.05).

Defranchi Y.D.; Winkler F.M.; Farías W.J.; Herbinger C.; Brokordt K.B.,First insight into the heritable variation and potential response to selection of phototaxis and locomotion behavior associated to the light/dark stimuli in the abalone Haliotis discus hannai,2019,Aquaculture,500,,645,650,,"Abalones are especially susceptible to environmental lighting conditions. This factor greatly affects crucial biological process such as feeding rates, energy balance, physiological stress status, and consequently, growth and survival of farmed abalone. Most of these effects have been studied in the economically valuable abalone Haliotis discus hannai. The use of specific photoperiods, and/or light qualities and intensities, have been proposed as managing strategies to increase its production; however, for extensive off-shore or in intensive land-based farming systems, lighting conditions are not likely to be easily managed. Despite the great importance of the biological responses to the light/dark stimuli for abalone farming production, to the best of our knowledge the genetic control upon the variation associated behavioral traits have not been studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the heritable variation and potential responses to selection for the phototaxis [i.e., displacement towards (positive) or against (negative) the light source] and locomotion behaviors associated to the intensity of the response (i.e., crawling speed and displacement distance) to the light/dark stimuli in juvenile H. discus hannai. Genetic and phenotypic correlations between these traits were also estimated. Results showed moderate but significant heritable variations for phototaxis (h2 = 0.15) and locomotion responses (h2 = 0.18–0.37); and significant positive genetic correlations among them. Expected gain responses to selection per generation (with a selection intensity of 2.06, i.e., selecting 5% of the individuals from a population) were moderate for phototaxis variation (16%) and high for locomotion responses variation (33–67 or 36–73%, depending on the model used for the estimations). As a consequence, the potential for reducing (or incrementing, depending on the breeding goal) the reactivity or the sensibility to the light stimulus by selective breeding is good, and can be an attractive way of indirectly improving growth, survival and general welfare of farmed H. discus hannai. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.10.065,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056223690

Thus, the experimental feed containing 105 cfu/g B. amyloliquefaciens not only facilitated the food intake and growth of abalone, but also effectively enhanced their non-specific immunity and resistance to V. parahaemolyticus infection. In this regard, B. amyloliquefaciens may be a useful probiotic strain for abalone aquaculture. © 2019",10.1016/j.fsi.2019.08.067,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072585213

During the process, we expect that behavioural and physiological traits may evolve to become more adapted to their captive environment. These modifications may result from intentional selection of production traits or unconscious and unintentional selection due to conditions experienced in the farm environment. To study this process at the earliest stage, the progeny of 3 different broodstocks obtained from wild parents, selected farmed abalone and randomly sampled farmed abalone, were studied. After rearing for 16 mo in separate tanks, offspring from the 3 progenies were placed together in sea cages at the same density. After 3 yr, behavioural traits were studied, and the immune status after a stress situation was assessed. Mortality and growth were also recorded. In spite of the fact that no significant differences were observed in survival, growth or immune status traits between the 3 progenies, less progeny from the selected broodstock performed the complete sequence of anti-predation behaviour, and they took more time to reach their hides compared to the wild progeny. In addition, the shell colours of the selected progeny were more orange and had more stripes compared to the brown-green colour of the wild progeny. Progeny of randomly sampled broodstock showed intermediate responses between those of wild and selected progeny. Our results suggest that associated behavioural trade-offs can take place after only one generation of selection to improve growth. This should be taken into consideration when using selected stocks for ranching or population enhancement programs. © The authors 2019.",10.3354/aei00300,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063623086

Although the majority of fisheries in the world are managed at the national or local scale, most existing approaches to assessing climate impacts on fisheries have been developed on a global scale. It is often difficult to translate from the global to regional and local settings because of limited relevant data. To address the need for fisheries management entities to identify those fisheries with the greatest potential for climate change impacts, we present an approach for estimating expected climate change-driven impacts on the productivity and spatial range of fisheries at the regional scale in a data-poor context. We use a set of representative Mexican fisheries as test cases. To assess the implications of climate impacts, we compare biomass, harvest, and profit outcomes from a bioeconomic model under contrasting management policies and with and without climate change. Overall results show that climate change is estimated to negatively affect nearly every fishery in our study. However, the results indicate that overfishing is a greater threat than climate change for these fisheries, hence fixing current management challenges has a greater upside than the projected future costs of moderate levels of climate change. Additionally, this study provides meaningful first approximations of potential effects of both climate change and management reform in Mexican fisheries. Using the climate impact estimations and model outputs, we identify high priority stocks, fleets, and regions for policy reform in Mexico in the face of climate change. This approach can be applied in other data-poor circumstances to focus future research and policy reform efforts on stocks now subject to additional stress due to climate change. Considering their growing relevance as a critical source of protein and micronutrients to nourish our growing population, it is urgent for regions to develop sound fishery management policies in the short-term as they are the most important intervention to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on marine fisheries. © 2019 Cisneros-Mata et al.

However, the applications of iodine in marine products in the food industry have not been studied extensively. Therefore, in this study, a novel iodized salt was prepared through a simple method for iodine extraction from natural iodine-rich sources and spray drying. Laminaria ochroleuca (kombu), Porphyra umbilicalis (nori), Undaria pinnatifida (wakame), and Haliotis discus hannai (abalone) were selected as natural iodine-rich sources. Through hot water extraction, iodine was extracted from the iodine-rich sources and iodized salt was successfully prepared with extracted iodine and sea salt by spray drying; extraction efficiency varied from 64.88% to 129.67%; yield, 38.45% to 57.09%; loading efficiency, 99.34% to 124.08%. Chemical interactions were assessed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and thermal dynamics was evaluated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Morphology of the salt crystals was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, a storage test was performed to investigate iodine loss due to temperature, relative humidity, and oxidation for 10 weeks in harsh condition. On comparing our salt with commercial products, novel iodized salts displayed similar or superior stability. Therefore, the novel iodized salt prepared in this study can be applied in the food industry. Practical Application: Iodine is essential trace element and plays a key role in our body. Marine products such as Laminaria ochroleuca (Kombu), Porphyra umbilicalis (nori), Undaria pinnatifida (wakame), and Haliotis discus hannai (abalone) are known as iodine rich-sources. These products have high level of iodine, but iodine in marine products has not been used widely for food industry. Therefore, using iodine in natural sources, novel iodized salt was prepared with simple method (hot water extraction and spray drying). The novel iodized salt prepared in this study can be applied in the food industry. © 2018 Institute of Food Technologists®",10.1111/1750-3841.14163,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046791967

Genetic data regarding this species are limited to the 16S rRNA gene. The inability to grow it axenically has hindered its genetic and genomic characterization and, in consequence, a thorough analysis of its systematics. Here, we amplified and sequenced five genes (16S rRNA, 23S rRNA, ftsZ, virD4 and virB11) of Ca.Xc from infected abalone to analyse its phylogenetic position. Phylogenies from concatenated DNA and amino acid sequences with representative genera of most Rickettsiales unequivocally place Ca.Xc in the family Anaplasmataceae. Furthermore, the family has two reciprocally monophyletic lineages: one leading to (Neorickettsia, Ca.Xc) and the other to ((Ehrlichia, Anaplasma), Wolbachia)). A molecular-clock Bayesian reconstruction places Ca.Xc as the most basal lineage in Anaplasmataceae. These phylogenetic hypotheses shed light on patterns of host evolution and of ecological transitions. Specifically, Neorickettsia and Ca.Xc inhabit aquatic hosts whereas the remaining Anaplasmataceae are found in terrestrial hosts. Additionally, our evolutionary timeline places the directly transmitted marine Ca.Xc as the basal Anaplasmataceae, ancestral to both freshwater and terrestrial species with adaptations leading to more complex life cycles involving intermediate vectors or reservoir species; this supports the hypothesis of a marine origin for this bacterial family. © 2017 IUMS.",10.1099/ijsem.0.001563,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013854882

Feeding behavior was scored in terms of the following activities: quiescence, alertness, moving, feeding, distance traveled, velocity, and homing. There was a significant effect of diet type and temperature on feeding behavior of abalone. Both types of abalone were more active and exhibited the highest velocity when fed the formulated diet at 22°C. Greenlip abalone spent a larger proportion of time feeding on Ulva sp. than on the formulated diet, regardless of the water temperature. In contrast, no significant difference was observed in the proportion of time feeding between diet types for hybrid abalone. Both types of abalone rapidly located and consumed Ulva sp. when feed was introduced into the aquaria at 1600 h (light phase). In contrast, abalone predominantly commenced feeding on the formulated diet in the dark phase, indicating the potential of Ulva sp. as feed attractant in abalone diet, to promote feeding. The mode in which abalone consumed feed also differed between diets. Abalone fed the formulated diet nibbled intermittently on random chips, whereas when fed Ulva sp., abalone engulfed entire individual fronds before moving on to the next available frond. Greenlip and hybrid abalone exhibited homing behavior at the completion of the dark phase, which was more pronounced in abalone fed Ulva sp. This new information may assist in refining feed design and feeding practices for the culture of these two types of abalone.",10.2983/035.035.0310,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991740190

In vitro assays demonstrated the dose-dependent and inhibitory effect of purified hemocyanin against HSV-1 infection in Vero cells with a 50% effective dose (ED50) of 40 to 50 nM and no significant toxicity. In addition, hemocyanin specifically inhibited viral attachment and entry by binding selectively to the viral surface glycoproteins gD, gB, and gC, probably by mimicking their receptors. However, hemocyanin had no effect on postentry events and did not block infection by binding to cellular receptors for HSV. By the use of different mutants of gD and gB and a competitive heparin binding assay, both protein charge and conformation were shown to be the driving forces of the interaction between hemocyanin and viral glycoproteins. These findings also suggested that hemocyanin may have different motifs for binding to each of the viral glycoproteins B and D. The dimer subunit of hemocyanin with a 10-fold-smaller molecular mass exhibited similar binding to viral surface glycoproteins, showing that the observed inhibition did not require the entire multimer. Therefore, a small hemocyanin analogue could serve as a new antiviral candidate for HSV infections. Copyright © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Abalone aquaculture is still a developing industry, and at least two major issues, nutrition and health, impede its development. Abalone are fed macroalgae on-farm in a number of countries, including China, Korea, South Africa and Chile. Formulated diets are crucial to the success of abalone aquaculture in countries where abalone do not grow readily when fed brown macroalgae or when access to macroalgae is insufficient for culture. Typically, the growth rate of abalone fed formulated diets is higher than abalone fed live macroalgae. However, due to a long production period, diets for abalone not only need to sustain high growth rates, but also maintain optimal health. Feeding live macroalgae improves the feeding activity, health and marketability of abalone. In this review, the nutritional requirements of abalone and dietary ingredients used in formulated diets will be discussed, together with the use of dried macroalgal meal as a dietary ingredient in formulated diets to improve the feeding activity, health and marketability of abalone in commercial production. © 2016 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",10.1111/raq.12085,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84909617040

Three hundred thousand veliger larvae were stocked/tank containing 80 corrugated plates with mucus trails hanging on bamboo poles. Feeds were given at 0900 h starting at day 3 with seawater flow through introduced every 1400 h starting day 5. Two-way analysis of variance determined significant differences (p < 0.05) in survival and shell length between larval sources and feed types. Tukey’s post hoc test established differences among treatment means. At day 30, survival for HB- and WS-sourced larvae was significantly higher (42%) in TMT3 compared with TMT2 having 35% for HB and 38% for WS (p < 0.05). Larvae fed with TMT1 had significantly lowest survival among the three treatments. Survival at 60 and 90 days did not show significant difference for TMT2 and TMT3 regardless of broodstock source. Post-larval shell growth (90 days), from both sources fed with TMT2 and TMT3, was significantly higher than TMT1 (p < 0.05). Larval performance did not show any significant interactions between HB and WS broodstock.

This study was performed to investigate whether W1/O/W2 double emulsions can be used to enhance the saltiness of cheese without increasing the salt content (W1 is distilled water or 1% abalone hydrolysate, and W2 is 1% NaCl or 1% abalone hydrolysate + 1% NaCl solution). We also investigated the effect of adding abalone hydrolysate to the double emulsion as a saltiness enhancer. The cheeses were physico-chemically evaluated to determine curd yield, pH value, moisture content, color, texture, salt release rate, and sensory properties. No significant differences were observed in curd yield, pH value, moisture content, lightness, or redness between the cheeses made with and without the double emulsion. However, in the evaluation of salt release rate, fresh cheese made with double emulsion (W1 = distilled water, W2 = 1% NaCl + 1% abalone hydrolysate) was detected earlier than the control or the other treatments. In the sensory evaluation, fresh cheese made with the double emulsion showed higher scores for saltiness and overall preference than the control or the other treatments. We concluded that abalone hydrolysate encapsulated in a double emulsion (W1 is water and W2 is abalone hydrolysate and NaCl solution) could enhance the saltiness of fresh cheese while maintaining the same salt concentration, without altering its physical properties. © Korean Society for Food Science of Animal Resources.",10.5851/kosfa.2017.37.2.210,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023198883
Farías W.J.; Winkler F.M.; Brokordt K.B.,"Genotype by environment interactions, heritabilities and genetic correlations for productive traits of Haliotis rufescens",2017,Aquaculture,473,,407,416,,"A critical aspect of a selective breeding program is whether responses of traits of interest are similar in different environments. The magnitude of the genotype by environment interaction (GEI) together with heritability (h2) accounts for this aspect. Despite the economic significance of abalones and the interest in genetic improvement programs for their cultivation, only one previous study has reported GEI estimations for this group of mollusks. The objective of the present study was to estimate h2 and the existence of GEI for growth traits of Haliotis rufescens cultivated in Chilean farms with different environmental and management conditions. A total of 2 cohorts (2007 and 2009) of 50 and 42 families of full sibs (FS), respectively, were used. Replicates of each FS family of the 2007 cohort were distributed in two farms in the northern region of the country and were evaluated after 1 and 2 years of cultivation. For the 2009 cohort, replicates of each family were distributed in a farm in the northern region and a farm in the southern region of the country. The estimated h2 values were significant for all traits, with the length and width of the shell and total weight varying primarily by cohort between 0.22–0.62, 0.16–0.58 and 0.40–0.53, respectively. The genetic correlations (rG) between traits were all higher than 0.82. The expected correlated responses for improving the total weight using the shell length as a selection criterion predict a selection gain (14–51%) similar to what would be obtained by selecting directly for weight (16–51%) in all environments examined. Thus, indirect selection by shell length and the direct use of total weight as a selection criterion would yield similar effects in terms of the increase in weight. High rG, not significantly different from 1, were observed for the analyzed traits between replicates of the families in any of the farms compared, both within the northern region and between the northern and southern regions of the country. These high rG were indicative of non-significant GEI for the analyzed traits. Therefore, results suggest that one selective breeding program could provide improved red abalone for the industry in Chile with consistent results between farms located in different environments. Statement of relevance Abalones are one of the most important mollusks in aquaculture due to their commercial value in international markets, especially in Asia; as such there are several efforts to develop abalone breeding programs in different countries. In this work we addressed a critical aspect for a selective breeding program, which is to know whether responses of productive traits are similar in different environments. Considering that the magnitude of the genotype by environment interaction (GEI) together with heritability (h2) accounts for this aspect, we estimated these genetic quantitative parameters for growth traits (total mass, shell length and width) in two cohorts of the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, cultivated throughout Chile. Results indicated that the application of selection by the shell length at age of harvest has the greatest potential for improving the production of H. rufescens. These improvements are practical (ease and accuracy in measurement), have indirect effects on the objective trait of selection (weight), and consist of a trait that is not significantly affected by genotype-environment interactions. In addition, the results obtained suggest that a single selective breeding program would be sufficient for the red abalone industry in Chile, as the response to selection of traits associated with growth would be similar in different environments. Red abalone is naturally distributed in California and Baja California coasts, and this information can be especially useful in planning breeding programs also in the west coast of USA and México. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.02.030,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014832311
Lee H.S.; Lee K.J.,Alterations of Food-specific Serum IgG4 titers to common food antigens in patients with irritable bowel syndrome,2017,Journal of Neurogastroenterology and Motility,23,4,578,584,,"Background/Aims The role of dietary factors in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is still unclear. The aim of this study was to compare IgG4 levels to common food antigens between patients with IBS and healthy controls. Methods Thirty-two patients diagnosed as IBS according to the Rome III criteria (12 diarrhea subgroup; 20 non-diarrhea subgroup) and 32 sex and age-matched healthy controls participated in the study. Serum IgG4 titers to 90 common foods were measured in each subject. The number of subjects with positivity defined as the cut-off value ≥ 0.7 U/mL was compared. Results Patients with IBS had significantly higher IgG4 titers to wheat, leek and taro compared to those of controls. Serum IgG4 titers to ginger, cocoa, walnut, white radish, onion, and lettuce in IBS patients tended to be higher than controls. IgG4 titers to wheat, gluten and gliadin in the diarrhea subgroup, and lettuce, leek and taro in the non-diarrhea subgroup tended to be higher compared with controls. The number of subjects with positivity to apple, orange, lettuce, and leek was significantly higher in IBS patients than controls. The number of subjects with positivity to apple, orange, gluten, and gliadin in the diarrhea subgroup, and egg white, pineapple, soybean, lettuce, and leek in the non-diarrhea subgroup was significantly higher compared with controls. Conclusions Serum IgG4 antibody levels to some common foods are abnormally elevated in IBS patients. The type of foods with abnormally elevated serum IgG4 titers in the diarrhea subgroup may be different from that in the non-diarrhea subgroup. © 2017 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility.",10.5056/jnm17054,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030791793
Wang T.; Nuurai P.; McDougall C.; York P.S.; Bose U.; Degnan B.M.; Cummins S.F.,Identification of a female spawn-associated Kazal-type inhibitor from the tropical abalone Haliotis asinina,2016,Journal of Peptide Science,,,461,470,,"Abalone (Haliotis) undergoes a period of reproductive maturation, followed by the synchronous release of gametes, called broadcast spawning. Field and laboratory studies have shown that the tropical species Haliotis asinina undergoes a two-week spawning cycle, thus providing an excellent opportunity to investigate the presence of endogenous spawning-associated peptides. In female H. asinina, we have isolated a peptide (5145 Da) whose relative abundance in hemolymph increases substantially just prior to spawning and is still detected using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography chromatograms up to 1-day post-spawn. We have isolated this peptide from female hemolymph as well as samples prepared from the gravid female gonad, and demonstrated through comparative sequence analysis that it contains features characteristic of Kazal-type proteinase inhibitors (KPIs). Has-KPI is expressed specifically within the gonad of adult females. A recombinant Has-KPI was generated using a yeast expression system. The recombinant Has-KPI does not induce premature spawning of female H. asinina when administered intramuscularly. However it displays homomeric aggregations and interaction with at least one mollusc-type neuropeptide (LRDFVamide), suggesting a role for it in regulating neuropeptide endocrine communication. This research provides new understanding of a peptide that can regulate reproductive processes in female abalone, which has the potential to lead to the development of greater control over abalone spawning. The findings also highlight the need to further explore abalone reproduction to clearly define a role for novel spawning-associated peptide in sexual maturation and spawning.

Traditionally, abalone farmers have used a combination of UV irradiation and application of temperature gradients to the tank water to artificially induce spawning. Proteins are known to regulate crucial processes such as respiration, muscle contraction, feeding, growth and reproduction. Spawning as a pre-requisite of abalone reproduction is likely to be regulated, in part, by endogenous proteins. A first step in elucidating the mechanisms that regulate spawning is to identify which proteins are directly involved during spawning. The present study examined protein expression following traditional spawning induction in the Haliotis laevigata female. Gonads were collected from abalone in the following physiological states: (1) spawning; (2) post-spawning; and (3) failed-to-spawn. Differential protein abundance was initially assessed using two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry for protein identification. A number of reproductive proteins such as vitellogenin, vitelline envelope zona pellucida domain 29 and prohibitin, and metabolic proteins such as thioredoxin peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and heat shock proteins were identified. Differences in protein abundance levels between physiological states were further assessed using scheduled multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. Positive associations were observed between the abundance of specific proteins, such as heat shock cognate 70 and peroxiredoxin 6, and the propensity or failure to spawn in abalone. These findings have contributed to better understand both the effects of oxidative and heat stress over abalone physiology and their influence on abalone spawning. © 2016",10.1016/j.cbd.2016.04.005,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84971637069

Two species of dried macroalgae meal (Ulva sp. and Gracilaria cliftonii) at four levels (0% basal diet, 5%, 10% and 20%) of dietary inclusion were fed to the abalone (2.89 ± 0.01 g; shell length 22.41 ± 0.06 mm) for 92 days. The abalone fed G. cliftonii meal developed brown-red colour on the shell and the increased inclusion of algal meal resulted in darker brown shells, whereas abalone fed Ulva sp. meal or the basal diet exhibited light green shells. Although foot hue and foot brightness were not influenced by the type and level of inclusion of dried algal meal, the foot colour saturation of abalone fed ≥ 10% macroalgal meal was significantly higher than those fed the basal diet. Abalone developed a green lip when fed ≥ 10% of G. cliftonii meal, whereas lip colour did not change when fed Ulva sp. meal inclusion, compared to the basal diet, and exhibited milky lip colour. Although diet pigments varied with the species of macroalgae and inclusion level, β-carotene was the major pigment in the tissue of abalone fed all test diets and its content increased significantly with the inclusion level of macroalgae in the diet. Abalone fed the basal diet had significantly lower tissue β-carotene than those fed the diets with macroalgal inclusion. This study suggests that the inclusion of ≥ 5% G. cliftonii can produce a brown-red shell and the inclusion of ≥ 10% G. cliftonii intensifies the green colour of the lip. The brown-red colour mark on the shell by feeding macroalgal meal may be used as a harmless shell-marking method for ranching, stock enhancement or growth study in the wild.

Dried macroalgae meals are promising ingredients for abalone diets. In this 92-day study, the growth, feed utilisation and digestive enzyme activities of greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata; 2.89 g) fed dried macroalgae meals (Ulva sp. meal or Gracilaria cliftonii meal) in formulated diets were investigated. Seven experimental formulated diets, a basal diet (0 % diet) and three inclusion levels of Ulva sp. meal (5, 10 and 20 % inclusions) and Gracilaria sp. meal (5, 10 and 20 % inclusions) were used. Diets were formulated to contain 35 % crude protein, 5 % crude lipid and 17.5 MJ kg−1 gross energy. A commercial diet was also fed to abalone and compared with the 0 % diet. Growth and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of abalone fed the 0 % diet and commercial diet were similar. Abalone fed 5 % Gracilaria sp. meal or Ulva sp. meal exhibited superior growth to abalone fed 0 %. However, increasing dietary Gracilaria sp. meal inclusions (>10 %) led to further growth improvements but impaired protein and energy retentions. In contrast, abalone fed >10 % Ulva sp. meal inclusions exhibited similar growth to those fed 0 and 5 % Ulva sp. Although Ulva sp. and Gracilaria sp. meals are currently not commercially viable, this study clearly demonstrates the potential to develop abalone feeds with inclusions of dried macroalgae meal. We recommend a dietary inclusion of 10 % Gracilaria sp. meal or 5 % Ulva sp. meal to improve abalone growth. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",10.1007/s10811-016-0829-0,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964330053

Recent research identified higher optimal dietary CP levels of greater than or equal to 35%for younger than 1-y-old abalone at higher water temperatures (20-22°C). To validate the results of the laboratory-based research, the current trial was designed to investigate the effect of feeding two different commerciallymanufactured diets (standard-protein diet, 32%CP, versus a high-protein diet, 39%CP) to hybrid abalone (Haliotis laevigata ×Haliotis rubra; initial weight: 3.10 g) on growth performance, feed utilization, and sales revenue under on-farm conditions. During this 18-mo trial, abalone were cultured using normal commercial practices over two summer periods at Great Southern Waters abalone farm (Indented Head, VIC, Australia). A significant improvement in specific growth rate (SGR) led to a 9% improvement in biomass gain for abalone fed with the high-protein diet. This improvement was achieved with no differences in survival, and minimal difference in feed input between diets. In addition, the feed conversion ratio of abalone fed with the high-protein feed was 7.1% superior to that of animals fed with the standardprotein diet. On the basis of a farmgate value ofAUD35/kg abalone, for an additional feed input cost ofAUD2/m2 slab tank/y, a 9.5%increase in basic annual sales revenue (AUD44/m2 slab tank/y) was achieved feeding the high-protein diet. In addition, due to an increased SGR by feeding the high-protein diet, the duration of a typical 3-y production cycle for hybrid abalone may be shortened by up to 3.4 mo. By adopting the high-protein diet, farmers may also harvest abalone sooner, and reduce exposure to one less summer. This may reduce heat-related mortalities and further improve productivity, and when combined with savings made with biomass and feed efficiency gains, a more than 10%improvement in productivity across the entire grow-out period for hybrid abalone may be achieved.",10.2983/035.035.0316,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991755562

Three AMPs were purified with a 5 kDa ultrafiltration, Sephadex G-15 column and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The FSB-AMP, HTSKALLDMLKRLGK, identified by an RP-nano-ultrapure liquid chromatography (UPLC) electrospray ionization (ESI)-tandem mass spectroscopic (MS/MS) analysis exhibited the highest bactericidal activity against VA and VP compared to the others. The antimicrobial activity assessment indicated that FSB-AMP inhibited the growth of VA and VP with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 72.5 and 72.5 μM. Alterations in the morphology of VA were observed by scanning electronic microscopy, and membrane disruption of VA and VP was confirmed by fluorescent microscopy with propidium iodide staining. The FSB-AMP was then incorporated into the diet of white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, and a protective effect in shrimp against VP infection was recorded as well as for shrimp fed a diet containing 15% fish meal replaced by B. subtilis E20-FSBM.

Largo D.B.; Diola A.G.; Marababol M.S.,"Development of an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) system for tropical marine species in southern cebu, Central Philippines",2016,Aquaculture Reports,3,,67,76,,"This study presents the establishment of an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) system in the tropical open waters of southern Cebu, Philippines using a combination of locally available species, namely donkey's ear abalone (Haliotis asinina) as fed species and seaweeds (Gracilaria heteroclada and Eucheuma denticulatum) as inorganic extractive species. The culture of Caulerpa lentillifera as a biofilter did not work in the open sea cultivation system using baskets. Monthly measurements of shell length, width and body weight of the cultured abalones, together with in situ measurements of physicochemical parameters to assess any changes in water quality, mainly nitrate, nitrite, ammonia and phosphate, were conducted over a year period from February 2013 to January 2014 in three designated stations (Abalone, Seaweed and Control Stations) at three different depths (surface, middle and bottom). Cage culture of abalone side by side with seaweeds in the open sea did not result in any significant water quality disturbance in the area - at least not in the current volume of caged abalones being used. Of the four inorganic compounds monitored in the field, nitrate and ammonia in the Seaweed Station were shown to have relatively lower year-round average values when compared with the Abalone Station, although in the case of nitrate, it was higher in the Control Station compared with the abalone and Seaweed Stations. Although this difference was not significant, it shows the red seaweeds, G. heteroclada and E. denticulatum, to be functioning as a natural filter for these two nutrients. In contrast, nitrite, and phosphate concentrations were not reduced indicating that the seaweeds were not effective biofilter for these two nutrients. The two-month old hatchery-bred donkey's ear abalones can grow to a size of 53.8 × 28.2 mm (L × W) and body weight of 37.8 g after a period of 12 months. Any expansion of the farm into a much larger commercial-scale farm will have to be complimented with seaweeds stocked around it if only to mitigate possible build-up of excess inorganic wastes - to serve as both a natural filter and as a source of natural feed. The potential use of an organic extractive species has to be further studied under farm condition to achieve its full potential as an IMTA species. © 2015 The Authors.

A 60-day feeding trial was conducted in a static water system for abalone (initial weight: 3.17 ± 0.01 g) exposed to 0.02 mg L−1 of waterborne Cu. The animals were fed one of the three experimental diets with 0.10, 1.31 and 4.20 mg kg−1 of Se from Na2SeO3·5H2O respectively. Results showed that the abalone fed 1.31 mg kg−1 of dietary Se had the lowest Cu concentration in shell, muscle, mantle, gill, hepatopancreas and serum. Meanwhile, the significant lowest contents of malondiadehyde and protein carbonyl in hepatopancreas were also found in the treatment with 1.31 mg kg−1 of dietary Se (P < 0.05). In addition, this treatment had significant higher glutathione content and thioredoxin reductase activity in hepatopancreas (P < 0.05). However, the activity of Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase (Se-GPx) was significantly decreased in the treatment with 4.20 mg kg−1 of dietary Se (P < 0.05). In this treatment, the protein carbonyl content in hepatopancreas was significantly higher than that in the group with 1.31 mg kg−1 of dietary Se (P < 0.05). In conclusion, in terms of anti-oxidation and Cu accumulation, the protective effects of dietary Se on abalone against waterborne Cu were dose-dependent. The 1.31 mg kg−1 of dietary Se had this effect, but not 4.20 mg kg−1 of dietary Se. Moreover, the latter increased the oxidative stress in abalone exposed to the waterborne Cu. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/are.12773,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929683381

Juvenile abalone was acclimated to the experimental conditions for 4 weeks. Seventy juvenile abalone averaging 0.43 g were randomly distributed into each of the 18, 70 L plastic rectangular containers. The experimental diets were fed to abalone once a day at a satiation level with a little leftover. The feeding trial lasted for 16 weeks. Survival of abalone was not affected by dietary substitution of ST with RB. However, weight gain of abalone fed the RB40 diet was higher than that of abalone fed the all other diets except for the RB0 diet. No significant difference in weight gain was found in abalone fed between the RB0 and RB100 diets. SGR of abalone fed the RB40 diet was higher than that of abalone fed the all other diets. Also SGR of abalone fed the RB0 diet was higher than that of abalone fed the RB100 diet, but not different from that of abalone fed the RB20, RB60 and RB80 diets. Moisture, crude protein and ash content of the soft body of abalone were affected by dietary substitution of ST with RB. In conclusion, the 100% ST could be substituted with RB without a retardation of weight gain of abalone when the 20% ST was included into the experimental diet. However, the best growth performance was obtained in abalone fed the RB40 diet substituting 40% ST with RB. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",10.1111/are.12577,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959528915

This bacterium in red abalone Haliotis rufescens, black abalone Haliotis cracherodii, and yellow abalone Haliotis corrugata from California, US and Baja California, Mexico has been found to be infected by a bacteriophage. To date, there is no information on the epizootiology of CXc and its bacteriophage in natural populations of abalone; furthermore, it is unknown if the bacteriophage was also present in CXc infecting blue abalone Haliotis fulgens. The objective of this study was to determine the distribution, prevalence and intensity of CXc, as well as to determine the distribution and prevalence of the bacteriophage and to study interactions between host sex and hyperparasitism in blue abalone and yellow abalone. Tissue samples were obtained from seven localities where the commercial capture of wild abalone is carried out. Samplings were conducted throughout the 2012–2013 capture seasons and a total of 182 blue abalone and 170 yellow abalone were obtained. The prevalence and intensity of CXc and the prevalence of the bacteriophage were determined by histology. The identity of CXc was confirmed by PCR, product sequence analysis and in situ hybridization while the identity of the bacteriophage was corroborated by TEM. The prevalence of CXc infected and uninfected by the bacteriophage was 80% in blue abalone and 62% in yellow abalone. Low infection intensities were found in 86% of blue abalone and 82% of yellow abalone. Infection intensity was significantly higher in undifferentiated yellow abalone. The bacteriophage in CXc showed a prevalence of 22% and 31% in blue abalone and yellow abalone respectively. These results show that CXc and its bacteriophage are widely distributed in the peninsula of Baja California and that they are well established in natural populations of blue abalone and yellow abalone.

Before the earthquake and tsunami, H. discus hannai of 2007–2010 yr classes were shown to undergo habitat shifts with growth from the crustose coralline algal area (CCA) to kelp beds (KB) via algal turfs (AT). These habitat shifts of abalone appear to occur because of its migration, associated with the ontogenetic changes in feeding behavior. Densities of 0-yr-old juvenile abalone (2010 yr class) and the sea urchin Mesocentrotus nudus inhabiting the CCA largely decreased just after the earthquake and tsunami, mainly affected by the catastrophic disturbance by this event. After that, previously unrecorded recruitments of juvenile macroalgae were observed in the CCA after the event probably because of the large-scale removal of the primary herbivore, the sea urchin M. nudus. Subsequently, the KB and AT expanded into the previous CCA area. After the tsunami, the major factors causing the continuously low densities of the 0-yr-old juvenile abalone (2011–2013 yr classes) are inferred to be the limited nursery CCA habitat because of mud and silt sedimentation, the expansion of the KB and AT, and/or the decreased densities of reproductive adult abalone due to the direct disturbance of the tsunami. The results of this study imply that maintaining diverse algal communities which enable the habitat shifts of juvenile abalone H. discus hannai is one of the crucial factors to their successful recruitment. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/fog.12191,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006100142

Recent research suggests that temperature-induced tissue breakdown allows bacteria entry to the host, and nutritional supplementation can alleviate this breakdown. The aim of this study was to alleviate mortality of greenlip abalone, Haliotis laevigata, cultured at high summer water temperatures (25 °C) by dietary intervention using graded levels of peanut skin extract (PE; 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5%), green tea extract (GTE; 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5%) and vitamin C (1.0% vitamin C; 1.0% vitamin C + 1.0% GTE; and 1.0% vitamin C + 1.0% PE) in a commercial diet; these supplements contain antioxidant and bioactive compounds. The commercial diet containing 5.0% Australian grapeseed extract (GSE) fed at 25 °C was also included as a negative temperature/positive diet control due to improved survival and health of abalone at high temperatures in our previous study.

Supplementation with PE and vitamin C had no beneficial effects on survival, while GTE holds promise as a potential dietary additive to enhance the survival of abalone at higher water temperature. This study confirms that supplementation of 5.0% GSE in the commercial diet also improves the survival of greenlip abalone cultured at high summer water temperature in the laboratory setting. Statement of relevance Purported to have diverse health benefits including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties, 5% Australian grape extract, graded levels of green tea extract, peanut skin extract and vitamin C were supplemented in a commercial abalone diet in order to improve survival of greenlip abalone at high water temperature. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2016.07.011,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989850999
Lopata A.L.; Fenemore B.; Potter P.C.,Crustacean allergy in South Africa,2017,Current Allergy and Clinical Immunology,30,4,234,238,,"A TRIBUTE TO PAUL POTTER I have known Prof Paul Potter since 1993, when I joined the National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS) at Groote Schuur Hospital, and I was one of his first doctoral students. Paul was not only my supervisor, but inspired me to investigate new and indigenous allergens causing clinical symptoms in South African allergic subjects. His way of dealing with patients in South Africa, with its unique biodiversity of populations, flora and fauna, was central to my entire career in the field of allergy research. He introduced me to the importance of focusing on patient service and management and not exclusively on the molecular side of laboratory sciences. Under Paul’s guidance, we conducted the first studies in Africa on allergic sensitisation to various indigenous seafood species, for which there were no diagnostics available at the time. We identified a novel allergen in abalone (perlemoen) – the first African allergen given a formal designation by the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS), which was subsequently published in 1997 in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, the premier journal in the field. A new ImmunoCAP for abalone was subsequently developed (f346). Our work on indigenous allergens did not stop with perlemoen. We investigated in detail the allergens causing asthma through inhaling dust when breeding locusts. Not only critters but, in addition, pigeons generate dust that causes allergic alveolitis. All these studies were published in several international journals as well as in the South African Current Allergy and Clinical Immunology Journal, and they provided valuable information for practising clinicians. Through Paul’s dedicated training we were able to establish a strong research team, at the University of Cape Town and then the IDM, supported by seven ALLSA grants and several NRF and MRC grants. This team focused on various aspects of seafood allergy and their research resulted in eight doctoral and master’s students’ successfully completing their degrees in the field of allergy, including murine models on mechanisms of seafood allergy and sensitisation to fish through workplace exposure. Whereas Paul started the African endeavour into seafood allergies with 100 patients from the Western Cape in 1996, 21 years later we continue this legacy of characterising indigenous allergens now Down Under, in Australia. With funding from Australia, the United States and Europe, our team has identified more than 20 novel seafood allergens and is now translating previous and current findings into the development of the first immunotherapeutic for fish and shellfish allergy. I would like to highlight our milestone publication on the immunological cross-reactivity of South African patients with crustacean allergy to a range of related indigenous crustacean species. This study was one of the very first international studies to focus on other crustaceans species besides shrimps or prawns. The diagnostic workup of the subjects in this study was challenging as no specific diagnostics where available at the time. Furthermore, this study also demonstrated distinct different immune responses to specific allergens in individual subjects with crustacean allergy, in particular those to our South African crayfish. © 2017, Allergy Society of South Africa.

Several approaches have been developed to understand protein-associated mechanisms of nacre formation, yet we still lack insight into how protein ensembles or proteomes manage nucleation and crystal growth. To provide additional insights, we have created a proportionally defined combinatorial model consisting of two nacre-associated proteins, C-RING AP7 (shell nacre, Haliotis rufescens) and pseudo-EF hand PFMG1 (oyster pearl nacre, Pinctada fucata), whose individual in vitro mineralization functionalities are well-documented and distinct from one another. Using scanning electron microscopy, flow cell scanning transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, Ca(II) potentiometric titrations, and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring quantitative analyses, we find that both nacre proteins are functionally active within the same mineralization environments and, at 1:1 molar ratios, synergistically create calcium carbonate mesoscale structures with ordered intracrystalline nanoporosities, extensively prolong nucleation times, and introduce an additional nucleation event. Further, these two proteins jointly create nanoscale protein aggregates or phases that under mineralization conditions further assemble into protein-mineral polymer-induced liquid precursor-like phases with enhanced ACC stabilization capabilities, and there is evidence of intermolecular interactions between AP7 and PFMG1 under these conditions. Thus, a combinatorial model system consisting of more than one defined biomineralization protein dramatically changes the outcome of the in vitro biomineralization process. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",10.1021/acs.biochem.6b00163,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969131780

One thousand two hundred sixty juvenile abalone were randomly distributed into 18 70-L plastic rectangular containers. Six experimental diets were prepared in triplicate. The TBM0 diet included 28% fish meal and 13% soybean meal as the protein source. Twenty-five, 50, 75, and 100% of the fish meal were substituted with TBM. Finally, salted sea tangle was prepared. The essential amino acids, such as isoleucine, lysine, and valine, tended to decrease with the dietary substitution of TBM for fish meal in the experimental diets. The weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone that were fed the TBM25 diet were higher than those of abalone that were fed the other diets. The crude protein content of the soft body of the abalone linearly decreased with the dietary substitution of TBM for fish meal. In conclusion, as much as 75% of the fish meal in the diet of abalone can be replaced with TBM without retardation in weight gain and SGR of the abalone when 28% fish meal was included. © the World Aquaculture Society 2016.",10.1111/jwas.12255,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955622709
Hwang E.K.; Ha D.S.; Park C.S.,Strain selection and initiation timing influence the cultivation period of Saccharina japonica and their impact on the abalone feed industry in Korea,2017,Journal of Applied Phycology,29,5,2297,2305,,"Cultivations of the brown seaweed, Saccharina japonica, was developed, promoted, and industrialized in the 1970s and is highly valued in Korea both for human consumption and as a feed for the rapidly developing abalone farming industry. Production has continually increased, and approximately 442,637 tonnes wet weight was harvested in Korea in 2015. Abalone is a highly sought-after delicacy in Korea, and the abalone farming industry has been developed based on a stable production of seaweed. Korean abalone farmers prefer to feed their stock on locally cultured S. japonica; however, between August and November, the supply of farmed S. japonica declines because higher seawater temperatures reduce S. japonica productivity. In an attempt to overcome this temperature-induced period of low production, cultivation trials with a strain of S. japonica selected to withstand higher cultivation temperatures were undertaken. Strain selection involved using individual parent thalli that were found to remain productive under high seawater temperature (26 °C) at Wando. Male and female gametophytes were isolated through 3 cycles of free-living gametophyte culture to produce the F3 strain used in the production trials. Production trials using the selected strain were initiated every month between December 2014 and March 2015. This delayed the initiation of culture beyond the latest initiation time currently used by farmers (December). Delaying initiation of cultivation resulted in delayed maximum growth compared to the control. Growth of the F3 strain continued for up to 3 months longer than normally achieved on farms for non-selected thalli. The mean length, growth rate, and biomass were also greater than those achieved by the control strain. The use of the F3 strain of S. japonica coupled with delayed initiation of culture can therefore be used to help to ensure a stable year round algal feed supply for abalone industry in Korea. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",10.1007/s10811-017-1179-2,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020059759

An eight-month on-farm growth trial was conducted with sub-adult Haliotis midae (∼43 mm shell length) fed graded levels of kelp in formulated feeds. Kelp inclusion (0.44–3.54% of pellet dry mass) promoted faster growth (65.7–74.5% total mass gain), with better feed and protein conversions (apparent feed conversion ratio [FCR] 1.4–1.8, apparent protein efficiency ratio [PER] 2.3–2.7), as compared with the non-supplemented feed (52.3% total mass gain, FCR 2.1, PER 1.9; p < 0.001). Abalone-gut bacterial DNA was sequenced using 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and the sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97% similarity level. A supplementary 16S rRNA gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis was employed. The dominant OTUs differed in terms of their relative abundances, with an autochthonous Mycoplasma strain being significantly more abundant (p = 0.03) in the gut of abalone fed a kelp-supplemented feed. The DGGE band patterns displayed higher within-group variability for abalone fed the control diet, suggesting that dietary kelp inclusion promotes gut-bacteria homeostasis. This may contribute to better feed utilisation and growth in abalone fed kelp-supplemented feeds. © 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd.",10.2989/1814232X.2017.1338203,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029499086

Specific items include shrimp, lobsters, oysters, mussels, scallops, clams, crabs, krill, crayfish, squid, cuttlefish, snails, abalone, and others. Shellfish, in general, contain appreciable quantities of digestible proteins, essential amino acids, bioactive peptides, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, astaxanthin and other carotenoids, vitamin B12 and other vitamins, minerals, including copper, zinc, inorganic phosphate, sodium, potassium, selenium, iodine, and also other nutrients, which offer a variety of health benefits to the consumer. Although shellfish are generally safe for consumption, their exposure to diverse habitats, the filter feeding nature of shellfish such as oysters, clams, and mussels, and unhealthy farming and handling practices may occasionally entail health risks because of possible presence of various hazards. These hazards include pathogenic organisms, parasites, biotoxins, industrial and environmental pollutants, heavy metals, process-related additives such as antibiotics and bisulfite, and also presence of allergy-causing compounds in their bodies. Most of the hazards can be addressed by appropriate preventive measures at various stages of harvesting, farming, processing, storage, distribution, and consumption. Furthermore, consumer safety of shellfish and other seafood items is strictly monitored by international, governmental, and local public health organizations. This article highlights the nutritional value and health benefits of shellfish items and points out the various control measures to safeguard consumer safety with respect to the products. © 2017 Institute of Food Technologists®",10.1111/1541-4337.12312,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033216559

One important question is whether OA will alter species interactions. Crustose coralline algae (CCA) provide space and chemical cues for larval settlement. CCA have shown strongly negative responses to OA in previous studies, including disruption of settlement cues to corals. In California, CCA provide cues for seven species of harvested, threatened, and endangered abalone. We exposed four common CCA genera and a crustose calcifying red algae, Peyssonnelia (collectively CCRA) from California to three pCO2 levels ranging from 419-2,013 μatm for four months. We then evaluated abalone (Haliotis rufescens) settlement under ambient conditions among the CCRA and non-Algal controls that had been previously exposed to the pCO2 treatments. Abalone settlement and metamorphosis increased from 11% in the absence of CCRA to 45-69% when CCRA were present, with minor variation among CCRA genera. Though all CCRA genera reduced growth during exposure to increased pCO2, abalone settlement was unaffected by prior CCRA exposure to increased pCO2. Thus, we find no impacts of OA exposure history on CCRA provision of settlement cues. Additionally, there appears to be functional redundancy in genera of CCRA providing cues to abalone, which may further buffer OA effects. © 2017 The Author(s).",10.1038/s41598-017-05502-x,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025129057

In this study, a novel peptide (A2) from abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) was applied to investigate its antimetastatic effects in MKN-28 gastric cancer cells. Enhanced activities of glycogen-synthase kinase 3β(GSK-3β) by A2 treatment contributed to modulation of β-catenin; hence, β-catenin signaling was downregulated, and translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus was repressed. Moreover, cellular protrusions including lamellipodia and filopodia were disrupted through downregulation of Rac1 and Cdc42 in response to A2 in MKN-28 cells. It is suggested that A2 inhibits cell migration through controlling levels of β-catenin, GSK-3β, and also induced disorganization of lamellipodia and filopodia.

Lee S.Y.; Nam Y.K.,Transcriptional responses of metallothionein gene to different stress factors in Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai),2016,Fish and Shellfish Immunology,58,,530,541,,"A novel metallothionein (MT) gene from the Pacific abalone H. discus hannai was characterized and its mRNA expression patterns (tissue distribution, developmental expression and differential expression in responsive to various in vivo stimulatory treatments) were examined. Abalone MT shares conserved structural features with previously known gastropod orthologs at both genomic (i.e., tripartite organization) and amino acid (conserved Cys motifs) levels. The 5′-flanking regulatory region of abalone MT gene displayed various transcription factor binding motifs particularly including ones related with metal regulation and stress/immune responses. Tissue distribution and basal expression patterns of MT mRNAs indicated a potential association between ovarian MT expression and sexual maturation. Developmental expression pattern suggested the maternal contribution of MT mRNAs to embryonic and early larval developments. Abalone MT mRNAs could be significantly induced by various heavy metals in different tissues (gill, hepatopancreas, muscle and hemocyte) in a tissue- and/or metal-dependent fashion. In addition, the abalone MT gene was highly modulated in responsive to other non-metal, stimulatory treatments such as immune challenge (LPS, polyI:C and bacterial injections), hypoxia (decrease from normoxia 8 ppm–2 ppm), thermal elevation (increase from 20 °C to 30 °C), and xenobiotic exposure (250 ppb of 17α-ethynylestradiol and 0.25 ppb of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin) where differential expression patterns were toward either up- or down-regulation depending on types of stimulations and tissues examined. Taken together, our results highlight that MT is a multifunctional effector playing in wide criteria of cellular pathways especially associated with development and stress responses in this abalone species. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.fsi.2016.09.030,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991492454

The algae Macrocystis pyrifera, Gracilaria chilensis, and Sarcothalia crispata were administered as mixed diets, mono diets, or in rotation changing weekly. Additionally, an artificial pellet feed (ABfeed) was administered alone using a feeder or as part of a mixed diet. The experiment lasted 10 mo. The 100% S. crispata diet was suspended after 4mo due to low survival rates (92.1% ± 3.4%). Treatments had significant effects (P < 0.05) on survival, growth, food consumption, and conversion factor. The lowest survival rate was obtained using the artificial feed with a feeder (94.2% ± 4.3%) and the highest with a mix of M. pyrifera and artificial feed (99.0% ± 0.8%). The highest growth rates were obtained with the mix of M. pyrifera, G. chilensis, and artificial feed (0.044 ± 0.007 mm/day per 0.054 ± 0.005 g/day) and with 100% M. pyrifera (0.043 ± 0.002 mm/day per 0.054 ± 0.01 g/day).

Structure of the digestive gland was described, and proteoglycan granules were detected in the digestive cells. The abundance of granules was variable, depending on the feed provided to the abalone, and this was reflected in their growth. Granular content in digestive cells fed Ulva sp. was scarce, leading to low growth rate and high feed conversion ratio (FCR). Digestive cells of juveniles fed E. menziesii led to the best nutritional condition, including many proteoglycans cellular granules, best weight growth rate and a low FCR.

Xu W.; Ni J.,Selection of cutting machine on removing fouling organisms on abalone shellfish and technological parameter optimization,2017,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,33,16,293,298,,"Abalone is a main commercial shellfish in China. Fouling organisms such as Hydroides, Balanus and Ostrea plicatula are harmful for shellfish cultivation. It's common to see lots of fouling organisms adhering on abalone shellfish in Fujian cultivation areas. Fouling organisms will increase the burden and make activities and feeding of abalone hard. The breathing holes are blocked by fouling organisms, which is another danger and may cause abalone suffocation. In this study removal technology was researched to keep the growth of abalone well. We know electric machines such as milling machine, electric motor saw and grinding machine have a certain value in use and the method could be used on removing fouling organisms. In order to verify the optimal machine and improve the removal process, the research focused on the impacts of removal method by machine and its parameters. Survival rate was one of the most important indices for the evaluation of removal processing, and removal speed was the other. The quality of removed shellfish of abalone needed to be judged by sensory evaluation. The comprehensive point was based on shellfish integrity, fouling organisms remained and abalone vitality. Hand held milling machine, electric motor saw and grinding machine were tested separately to remove the fouling organisms. The effects of different machines on removal speed and survival rate were compared, and the effects of different machines on sensory evaluation standard of abalone were analyzed simultaneously to select the optimal machine on removal. Then, the selected machine was tested to make follow-up testing. Different rotary files with the diameter of 6 mm (cylindrical round head, conical round head and conical tip) and different rotating speeds (17 000, 20 000, 23 000, 26 000 and 30 000 r/min) were tested respectively to get the optimal parameters. The results indicated that the optimal machine is hand held milling machine because it could provide stable performance of removal and keep a high survival rate. Although the fouling organisms were removed quickly and thoroughly by grinding machine, the survival rate of abalone was declined significantly after removing. The removal speeds of electric motor saw and hand held milling machine were very close. The score of fouling organisms remained increased significantly because the fouling organisms in the shellfish ditch were removed completely by milling machine with conical round head file. When the milling machine rotating speed was at 20 000-30 000 r/min, the removal speed increased significantly. The temperature of abalone was on the rise when the rotating speed was higher than 23 000 r/min, but the abalone vitality declined quickly with the increasing of the temperature of abalone. Through the test of using the optimal machine to remove fouling organisms, the optimal combination of the parameters above was obtained, which are using hand held milling machine with 6 mm diameter conical round head file, and its rotating speed is 20 000 r/min. Under this condition, the removal speed is 72.69 fouling organisms per minute, the survival rate is 98.87%, and the score of shellfish integrity, fouling organisms remained and abalone vitality is respectively 9.85, 9.72 and 9.81.

Results show that PEF extraction speed is much faster, and the extraction yield of protein is higher compared with traditional methods. Variation of PEF parameters and the extraction yield of protein were determined by single-factor experiments. The processing conditions were optimized by response surface methodology. The maximum extraction yield of protein of 77.08% was achieved under the following conditions: electric field intensity of 20 kV/cm, pulse number of 8 and enzymolysis time of 2 h. PEF can be widely used to extract protein with high speed and low pollution. Practical Applications: Freshwater mussel is widely cultured in China and plays a very important role in aquaculture business. Recently, thanks to the nutritional value, advantages for human diets and edibleness as other shellfish such as shrimp, clam, lobster, scallop, abalone and crab, mussel is in growing value. It is valuable to exploit it. This study of PEF method to extract protein from mussel is important to utilize the mussel meat. PEF, with advantages of non-thermal performance, speediness, efficiency, low power and low pollution, is currently used for non-thermal pasteurization of food and extraction of value components from different natural sources.

Then the orthogonal test was used to determine the best process conditions: the operating voltage of 20 V, the operation flow of 35 L/h, and salt concentration of 5.14%. It also turned out that 80.72% of the saltsin the abalone viscera fish sauce could be successfully removed and 91.66% of amino acidswere retained through the optimum operating conditions. © 2016, Editorial Office of Journal of CIFST.

A total of 915 ± 19 stained protein spots were detected from Haliotis discus hannai♀ × H. discus hannai♂ (DD), 935 ± 16 from H. gigantea♀ × H. gigantea♂ (GG) and 923 ± 13 from H. gigantea♀ × H. discus hannai♂ (GD). The spots from DD and GD were clustered together. The distance between DD and GG was maximal by hierarchical cluster analysis. A total of 112 protein gel spots were identified; of these, 59 were abalone proteins. The proteins were involved in major biological processes including energy metabolism, proliferation, apoptosis, signal transduction, immunity, lipid metabolism, electron carrier proteins, protein biosynthesis and decomposition, and cytoskeletal structure. Three of 20 differential expression protein spots involved in energy metabolism exhibited as upregulated in GD, 13 spots exhibited additivity, and four spots exhibited as downregulated in the offspring. Eleven protein spots were expressed at the highest level in DD. The proteins involved in stress responses included superoxide dismutase, peroxiredoxin 6, thioredoxin peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase. Two of seven differential expression protein spots involved in response to stress exhibited as upregulated in GD, three exhibited additivity, and two exhibited as downregulated. These results might suggest that proteomic approaches are suitable for the analysis of hybrids and the functional prediction of abalone hybridization. © 2015 Stichting International Foundation for Animal Genetics.",10.1111/age.12330,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946573110
Wu F.; Zhang G.,Potential of Abalone Shells as Vectors for Exotic Oyster Species in the Abalone Farming Practice in China,2016,Journal of Shellfish Research,35,3,619,624,,"Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai (Ino, 1953) aquaculture is a thriving and prosperous industry in China, producing more than 110,000 metric tons in 2013. In recent years, Fujian in the southern region of China has become the chief abalone farming center, accounting for 85% of the total Pacific abalone yield. The practice of transferring abalone to northern regions to oversummer emerged because of challenges in Fujian, such as fouling, high temperature stress, and unexpected extreme weather events. From the view of ecology and conservation biology, however, the potential ecological risks of this practice should be considered as the abalone shells could act as vectors of exotic organisms. In this study, oyster samples from the shells of live, farmed abalones were collected in Fujian in southern and Rongcheng in northern China. The oysters were identified using a recently developed molecular method. In addition, the fouling oysters on Pacific abalone transferred to the northern region were monitored in a field trial. Survivorship and growth performance of the fouling oysters on the transferred abalones were determined through investigation of digital images taken at 2-wk intervals during the oversummering period. Results of the molecular analysis showed that fouling oysters collected from southern and northern regions are Crassostrea angulata and Crassostrea gigas, respectively. The field trial demonstrated that approximately half of the C. angulata, from the southern region, were still alive after a 6-mo oversummering period in the northern region. Findings from this study have important implications for aquaculture, the management and monitoring of cultured populations of Pacific abalone, and the conservation of wild oyster species in China.",10.2983/035.035.0307,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991761768

Fertilized eggs and larvae were raised at water temperatures of 9°C, 12°C, 15°C, 18°C, and 21°C in two separate trials. The rate of larvae development increased significantly with each 3°C change in temperature. Survival from fertilization to settlement stage was greatest (56%) at 12°C, followed by survival of 23% at 15°C, and 2% at 18°C. Larvae raised at the extremes of 21°C and 9°C had 100% mortality by 90 and 100 h posthatch. The biological zero temperature, the point at which growth stops, is projected to be 3.04°C for white abalone, significantly lower than that of sympatric species. Fecundity was determined as 7,271 eggs/g for wild-caught abalone and 6,128 eggs/g for hatchery-reared abalone and was not significantly different from previous estimates based on gonad bulk index. The effect of feed and temperature on the growth of juvenile abalone was studied. Juvenile abalone 28 mm in length were held for 147 days at 12°C, 15°C, and 18°C and fed diets of kelps Macrocystis pyriferia (L.) C. Agardh, 1820; Laminaria farlowii (Setchell, 1893); Chondracanthus exasperatus (Harvey & Bailey, 1996); Palmaria mollis (Setchell & N. L. Gardner, 1903), or combinations of these algae. Juveniles displayed fastest growth at 15°C when fed M. pyriferia. Juvenile survival was highest at 12°C and lowest at 18°C, at which temperature animals succumbed to withering syndrome. Optimal seawater temperatures for both larval and juvenile white abalone were determined to be significantly lower than previously reported. In other experiments, animals 20mmin length stocked at 25 gm/L grew at 41 m/day versus 32 m/day for those at 50 gm/L. No significant difference in growth was observed for abalone grown under low lighting conditions (3%-5% ambient) and almost complete darkness (1% ambient light).",10.2983/035.035.0421,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008239789

A 7-month feeding trial was conducted on 12 000 Pacific abalones (Haliotis discus hannai) with four diets including two extruder-processed test diets (with & without addition of oleopaprika carotenoids), Pacific dulse (Palmaria mollis) and a combination of Pacific dulse and a test diet. The results showed that the two test diets resulted in higher survival of abalone, but with a lower growth rates when compared with Pacific dulse alone (P < 0.05). The combination diet achieved the highest survival and growth rates. The Pacific dulse resulted in abalone with dark-brown shells, which are preferred by Asian markets. The test diets led to 52% and 55% of the animals with pink coloured shells and the supplementation of oleopaprika did not affect shell pigmentation. The aqueous acidic extracts from both dark-brown and pink shells showed blue colour; HPLC-MS chromatography revealed that the pigments in the extracts were consistent with a biliverdin and a cysteine-biliverdin. These results are valuable for the development of abalone feed and the control of abalone shell colouration. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/are.12851,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937605648

Three experimental diets were formulated to contain 0 g kg−1 DDG (DDG0), 200 g kg−1 DDG from rice (diet DDG-R) and 200 g kg−1 DDG from rice and wheat flour (diet DDG-RW). In the first experiment, three replicate groups of the freshwater snails averaging 133.0 ± 2.48 mg were fed one of the experimental diets for 12 weeks. Weight gain of the juvenile freshwater snails was not affected by dietary DDG (P > 0.05). In the second experiment, three replicate groups of the juvenile abalones averaging 296.3 ± 1.73 mg were fed one of the three experimental diets for 22 weeks. Weight gain of the abalones was not affected by dietary DDG (P > 0.05). Proximate and amino acid compositions of the whole body in the freshwater snails and soft body in the abalones were not affected by dietary DDG (P > 0.05).

Treatments consisted of diets either containing a 1:1 ratio of cod liver oil (CLO) and soybean oil (SBO) (Diet 1) or thraustochytrid (Diet 2) as source of lipid and fatty acids at 2 % level. Natural diet Gracilariopsis heteroclada (Diet 3) served as the control. No significant difference in growth was observed in abalone fed Diet 3 (SGR: 5.3 % BW day−1; DISL: 265 μm day−1) and Diet 2 (SGR: 5.2 % BW day−1; DISL: 255 μm day−1). Survival ranged from 78 to 85 % for all treatments and was not significantly different from each other. A 96-h salinity stress test showed highest survival of 84 % in abalone fed Diet 2 compared with those fed diets 1 and 3 (42 %). The high growth rate of abalone fed Diet 2 and high tolerance to low salinity could be attributed to its high DHA content (8.9 %), which resulted to its high DHA/EPA ratio of 10.5 %. These fatty acids play a significant role in abalone nutrition. The fatty acid profile of abalone meat is a reflective of the fatty acid profile of the oil sources in the diet. The present study suggests that the use of Schizochytrium oil in lieu of CLO and SBO can support good growth of abalone which is comparable with abalone fed the natural seaweeds diet. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",10.1007/s10499-016-9974-3,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955579122

To understand the influence of food availability on the reproductive condition of the abalone Haliotis gigantea, we conducted a rearing experiment using four levels of food supply from starvation to saturation, and calculated the gonad and digestive gland volumes by treating them as an elliptical cone and elliptical frusta. Gonad volumes were highest in October, with higher values at higher food rations. Digestive gland volumes and foot wet-weight decreased from the start of the experiment in June until November, and then increased, corresponding to food supply levels. Because gonad volumes increased and spawning was confirmed even under starvation conditions, we believe that H. gigantea can reach reproductive maturity using only nutrient reserves. © 2016 The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.",10.2331/suisan.15-00020,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973660974

A urease-producing bacterial isolate AX5, identified as Citrobacter braakii, from calcite rich shells of abalone that could tolerate cadmium at the concentration of 250 mg/l was used. In order to investigate the role of MICP in enhancing the synthesis of CdS nanoparticles, the biomimetic synthesis was carried out by C. braakii in modified nutrient broth without amending any additional organic or toxic surfactants back into the environment. The large amount of monodispersed CdS nanoparticles was harvested and found to bind with biocalcite. XRD analysis confirmed the presence of CdS nanoparticles bound with biocalcite minerals in the precipitation. HRTEM and SEM micrographs showed spherical CdS nanoparticles of particle size in the range of 50-100 nm. The other characteristics of harvested CdS nanoparticles were studied with UV-vis, PL spectra, FTIR, and fluorescence microscopy. The findings of present study have important insights into the application of MICP as a promising mechanism for the biosynthesis of CdS nanoparticles. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.matdes.2016.03.008,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963591506

Although mixotrophy elevates the growth rate of T. helix by 79%–185%, its absolute growth rate is still as low as 0.3 d−1. Thus, if the mortality rate of T. helix due to predation is high, this dinoflagellate may not easily prevail. To investigate potential effective protistan grazers on T. helix, feeding by diverse heterotrophic dinoflagellates such as engulfment-feeding Oxyrrhis marina, Gyrodinium dominans, Gyrodinium moestrupii, Polykrikos kofoidii, and Noctiluca scintillans, peduncle-feeding Aduncodinium glandula, Gyrodiniellum shiwhaense, Luciella masanensis, and Pfiesteria piscicida, pallium-feeding Oblea rotunda and Protoperidinium pellucidum, and the naked ciliates Pelagostrobilidium sp. (ca. 40 μm in cell length) and Strombidinopsis sp. (ca. 150 μm in cell length) on T. helix was explored. Among the tested heterotrophic protists, O. marina, G. dominans, G. moestrupii, A. glandula, L. masanensis, P. kofoidii, P. piscicida, and Strombidinopsis sp. were able to feed on T. helix. The growth rates of all these predators except Strombidinopsis sp. with T. helix prey were lower than those without the prey. The growth rate of Strombidinopsis sp. on T. helix was almost zero although the growth rate of Strombidinopsis sp. with T. helix prey was higher than those without the prey. Moreover, T. helix fed on O. marina and P. pellucidum and lysed the cells of P. kofoidii and G. shiwhaense. With increasing the concentrations of T. helix, the growth rates of O. marina and P. kofoidii decreased, but those of G. dominans and L. masanensis largely did not change. Therefore, reciprocal predation, lysis, no feeding, and the low ingestion rates of the common protists preying on T. helix may result in a low mortality rate due to predation, thereby compensating for this species’ low growth rate. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.hal.2017.08.006,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028409990

Two experiments were conducted over 93. days to test the effect of diet on the colour of the foot and shell of 1-year old greenlip abalone Haliotis laevigata. In Experiment 1, a commercial control diet and two species of fresh macroalgae (. Gracilaria cliftonii and Ulva sp.) were used and each macroalgae species was either non-enriched or enriched with nutrients in the culture media. The shell of abalone fed the commercial diet and fresh Ulva sp. was green but abalone fed fresh G. cliftonii developed a brown shell. The fresh G. cliftonii increased shell colour purity while fresh Ulva sp. increased shell brightness. Feeding abalone with either fresh Ulva or fresh G. cliftonii produced yellowish foot. Nutrient enrichment of algae did not significantly affect the pigment contents in both macroalgae and abalone, and had minimal impact on the colour of shell and foot. With the exception of zeaxanthin, the pigment contents were significantly lower in fresh G. cliftonii than in fresh Ulva sp. Moreover, β-carotene was the main pigment in abalone fed both species of fresh macroalgae. In Experiment 2, the inclusion of dietary dried algae affected abalone colour. Three diets including a commercial control diet, a diet containing 3% dried Spirulina sp. and a diet containing 10% dried Ulva sp. were used. The shell of abalone fed dried Spirulina sp. was yellow-brown with higher colour purity while the shell remained light green in abalone fed dried Ulva sp. or the commercial control diet. The colour of abalone foot became bright yellow when abalone fed dried Ulva sp. Abalone fed dried algae contained β-carotene as the principal pigment. This study indicates that fresh macroalgae and dried algae supplementation in feed can change the colour of abalone foot and shell. Feed effect on shell colour was far more than on tissue colour. Feeding abalone with fresh G. cliftonii contributes to the formation of brown colour on the shell.

In protocerebrum, aELH-l-ir was detected in the small- and medium- sized neurons of cluster 6, anterior/posterior medial protocerebral neuropils, protocerebral bridge and central body. In deutocerebrum, the aELH-l-ir was observed in small-sized neurons of cluster 9, fibers between small-sized neurons of cluster 10, medium-sized neurons of cluster 11, olfactory neuropil and medial/lateral antenna I neuropils. In tritocerebrum, the medium- sized neurons of cluster 16, the tritocerebral commissure, and tegumental neuropil showed strong aELH-l-ir. In the ventral nerve cord, the aELH-l-ir was detected in the small- and medium-sized neurons of dorsolateral clusters of subesophageal ganglion. There was no aELH-l- ir in neurons of thoracic ganglion, but aELH-l-ir exhibited a dot-like structure in the subcapsular space around the thoracic neuropils. In abdominal ganglion, the aELH-l-ir was detected in some medium-sized neurons and abdominal neuropils. In the ovary, the aELH-l-ir was detected in the cytoplasm of oogonia, and all steps of developing oocytes. The effect of aELH on ovarian maturation in the crabs was examined by bioassay. When mature female crabs were injected with a dose of 500 ng/g body weight per crab, the ovarian maturation was accelerated as indicated by the rising of gonado-somatic index and levels of vitellin in the ovarian tissue and hemolymph, which was confirmed by histological studies. The aELH also enhanced the proliferation of follicular cells as indicated by the increased number of BrdU-labeled nuclei. In addition, the aELH also significantly induced the 17β-estradiol and progesterone secretion in the cultured ovarian explant. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the existence of an aELH-liked-peptide in the CNS and ovary of the P. pelagicus, and it can induce the ovarian 17β-estradiol and progesterone production resulting in early ovarian maturation in this crab. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.06.007,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020862068

This is certainly true for the mollusk shell, where glycosylated intracrystalline proteins such as AP24 (Haliotis rufescens) exist but their functions and the role of glycosylation remain elusive. To assess the effect of glycosylation on protein function, we expressed two recombinant variants of AP24: an unglycosylated bacteria-expressed version (rAP24N) and a glycosylated insect cell-expressed version (rAP24G). Our findings indicate that rAP24G is expressed as a single polypeptide containing variations in glycosylation that create microheterogeneity in rAP24G molecular masses. These post-translational modifications incorporate O- and N-glycans and anionic monosialylated and bisialylated, and monosulfated and bisulfated monosaccharides on the protein molecules. AFM and DLS experiments confirm that both rAP24N and rAP24G aggregate to form protein phases, with rAP24N exhibiting a higher degree of aggregation, compared to rAP24G. With regard to functionality, we observe that both recombinant proteins exhibit similar behavior within in vitro calcium carbonate mineralization assays and potentiometric titrations. However, rAP24G modifies crystal growth directions and is a stronger nucleation inhibitor, whereas rAP24N exhibits higher mineral phase stabilization and nanoparticle containment. We believe that the post-translational addition of anionic groups (via sialylation and sulfation), along with modifications to the protein surface topology, may explain the changes in glycosylated rAP24G aggregation and mineralization behavior, relative to rAP24N. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",10.1021/acs.biochem.5b01186,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959338440
Yoo H.Y.; Song Y.H.; Foo M.; Seo E.; Hwang D.S.; Seo J.H.,Recombinant mussel proximal thread matrix protein promotes osteoblast cell adhesion and proliferation,2016,BMC Biotechnology,16,1,,,16,"Background: von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a key load bearing domain for mamalian cell adhesion by binding various macromolecular ligands in extracellular matrix such as, collagens, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans. Interestingly, vWF like domains are also commonly found in load bearing systems of marine organisms such as in underwater adhesive of mussel and sea star, and nacre of marine abalone, and play a critical load bearing function. Recently, Proximal Thread Matrix Protein1 (PTMP1) in mussel composed of two vWF type A like domains has characterized and it is known to bind both mussel collagens and mammalian collagens. Results: Here, we cloned and mass produced a recombinant PTMP1 from E. coli system after switching all the minor codons to the major codons of E. coli. Recombinant PTMP1 has an ability to enhance mouse osteoblast cell adhesion, spreading, and cell proliferation. In addition, PTMP1 showed vWF-like properties as promoting collagen expression as well as binding to collagen type I, subsequently enhanced cell viability. Consequently, we found that recombinant PTMP1 acts as a vWF domain by mediating cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and formation of actin cytoskeleton. Conclusions: This study suggests that both mammalian cell adhesion and marine underwater adhesion exploits a strong vWF-collagen interaction for successful wet adhesion. In addition, vWF like domains containing proteins including PTMP1 have a great potential for tissue engineering and the development of biomedical adhesives as a component for extra-cellular matrix. © 2016 Yoo et al.",10.1186/s12896-016-0247-z,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957933584

This study aims to (i) investigate the effect of nutrient enrichment (non-enriched and enriched) and fresh macroalgae type (Ulva sp., Gracilaria cliftonii, and an equal combination of Ulva sp. and G. cliftonii) on the growth and feed utilisation of greenlip abalone and (ii) compare the performance of abalone fed fresh macroalgae to those separately fed either one of the three commercial formulated diets. Abalone were fed to excess at 16:00 h daily, and uneaten feed was collected the following morning. Nutrient enrichment increased the protein level for Ulva sp. and G. cliftonii from 5.3 to 27.7% and 12.9 to 38.1%, respectively. The growth of abalone fed G. cliftonii was superior to animals fed Ulva sp. The effect of enrichment was macroalgae species-dependent. While abalone fed enriched Ulva sp. exhibited superior growth to those fed non-enriched Ulva sp., animals fed non-enriched and enriched G. cliftonii exhibited similar growth. However, abalone fed non-enriched G. cliftonii had superior apparent protein deposition and protein efficiency ratio, compared to animals fed enriched G. cliftonii. Feeding an equal mix of Ulva sp. and G. cliftonii had a positive synergistic effect on abalone growth, compared to animals fed mono-specific algae. Abalone fed each commercial diet exhibited improved growth and feed utilisation compared to animals fed fresh macroalgae. The results of the current study suggest that the use of fresh G. cliftonii as a source of carbohydrates may spare protein when feeding formulated diets to abalone. When formulated diets are unavailable or are inappropriate to feed abalone, a mix of enriched Ulva sp. and G. cliftonii may be used. However, feeding fresh macroalgae alone to cultured greenlip abalone should be avoided, if growth is the parameter of interest and we recommend that commercial formulated diets be fed to cultured greenlip abalone.

Biofilm confers to bacteria more resistance to physical and chemical agents as well as to different mechanisms of the innate immune system. The aim of this work was to evaluate the ability of in vitro biofilm production in 32 S. uberis isolates from bovine mastitis and identified by biochemical tests and subsequently confirmed by the amplification of the pauA gene. The isolates were cultivated in TMP broth and TMP broth with the addition of 0.5% glucose, 1% sucrose, 1% lactose or 0.5% skim milk in microtiter plates stained with crystal violet. We demonstrated that S. uberis isolated from bovine mastitis are able to produce biofilms in TMP broth and, also that biofilm formation by S. uberis can be significantly enhanced by the addition of 0.5% glucose or 1% sucrose to TMP broth. This may suggest that the carbohydrates in milk or within the ruminant gut might affect the growth mode of S. uberis. In addition, our results showed that in vitro biofilm production under different conditions of supplementation displays variation among the isolates and that each isolate shows a particular profile of biofilm production. This phenotypic heterogeneity in biofilm production exhibited by S. uberis could at least partly explain why this bacterium has the ability to adapt to different niches facilitating survival to diverse and stressful conditions. © 2017 Asociación Argentina de Microbiología",10.1016/j.ram.2017.04.007,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026346605

The standard diet (Std) consists of FM (140 g/kg), fermented soybean meal (250 g/kg), corn gluten meal (34 g/kg), shrimp meal (30 g/kg), wheat flour (200 g/kg), dextrin (50 g/kg) and MA (250 g/kg). Undaria and Laminaria were also prepared. The feeding trial lasted for 16 weeks. Survival of abalone fed the formulated diets was higher than that of abalone fed the Undaria and Laminaria. Weight gain and specific growth rate of abalone fed the Std diet were higher than all other diets. Substitutability of the fermented soybean meal for FM seemed to be rather limited in the commercial diet for abalone farms. However, another 500 g/kg MA in the commercial diet could be substituted with rice bran as long as 500 g/kg MA were substituted with rice bran.

However, it has been unclear whether the end product of alginate lyases (i.e. unsaturated monouronate-derived 4-deoxy-L-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronic acid (DEH)) is assimilated by abalone itself, becauseDEH cannot be metabolized via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway of animals. Under these circumstances, we recently noticed the occurrence of an NADPH-dependent reductase, which reduced DEH to 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate, in hepatopancreas extract of the pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai. In the present study, we characterized this enzyme to some extent. The DEH reductase, named HdRed in the present study, could be purified from the acetone-dried powder of hepatopancreas by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by conventional column chromatographies. HdRed showed a single band of α40 kDa on SDS-PAGE and reduced DEH to 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate with an optimal temperature and pH at around 50 Â°C and 7.0, respectively. HdRed exhibited no appreciable activity toward 28 authentic compounds, including aldehyde, aldose, ketose, α- keto-acid, uronic acid, deoxy sugar, sugar alcohol, carboxylic acid, ketone, and ester. The amino acid sequence of 371 residues of HdRed deduced from the cDNA showed 18â€""60% identities to those of aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily enzymes, such as human aldose reductase, halophilic bacterium reductase, and sea hare norsolorinic acid (a polyketide derivative) reductase-like protein.

This is a particular concern for aquaculture industries due to the economic impacts of such events. Diets containing algal supplements have been suggested as pre-emptive solutions for preventing these mass mortalities. The same has also been suggested for diets containing grape seed extract. This is due to their potential as a source of antioxidative compounds, which reduce the accumulation of harmful reactive oxygen species. This study aimed to identify functional genes associated with high survival in abalone fed diets high in antioxidative compounds during heat stress. Tentacle transcriptomes of 40 greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) were investigated to determine the combined effects of differing diets and temperature on the gene expression responses by abalone. Here we compare the functional gene expression changes at 22 °C and 25 °C in abalone fed common commercial, live macroalgal (Ulva lactuca) and grape seed extract supplemented commercial diets as a means to understand the resulting high survival of abalone fed grape seed extract during heat stress. Twenty-four genes were differentially expressed between high survival promoting diets (macroalgae or grape seed extract supplemented commercial) relative to the purely commercial diet. Many of these genes have been suggested to be involved in antioxidant and innate immunity responses. The identification of these genes and their functional roles has enhanced our understanding of processes that contribute to summer stress resilience in abalone. Our study supports the hypothesis that diet and gene expression signatures may be indicative of the survival capabilities of abalone when exposed to heat stress. © 2017",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.07.025,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025652372

The results indicated that changes in the volatile flavors of abalone samples generated by different fumeol treatments could be sensitively detected using the electronic nose method. The results of GC-MS demonstrated that there were significant changes in the types and relative contents of volatile flavor compounds in fumeol-treated abalone, and 72 and 98 volatile compounds were detected in the liquid smoked abalone I processed with super fumeol II-2001 and liquid smoked abalone II processed with super fumeol II-2008A, respectively. Additionally, phenolic compounds were characteristic substances related to the smoked flavor, and 19 and 22 volatile phenolic compounds (contents: 47.52% and 55.94%, respectively) were found in liquid smoked abalone samples I and II, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) of GC-MS data suggested that GC-MS could effectively distinguish the abalone samples processed using different fumeols, and GC-MS results of the differences in flavor substances were consistent with those from the electronic nose. © 2016, South China University of Technology.

During industrial processing, the viscera, which are abundant of cellulase, are usually discarded or processed into low-value feedstuff. Thus, it is of interest to obtain cellulase from abalone viscera and investigate its application for preparation of functional oligosaccharides. RESULTS: A cellulase was purified from the hepatopancreas of abalone by ammonium sulfate precipitation and two-steps column chromatography. The molecular weight of the cellulase was 45 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Peptide mass fingerprinting analysis yielded 103 amino acid residues, which were identical to cellulases from other species of abalone. Substrate specificity analysis indicated that the cellulase is an endo-1,4-β-glucanase. Hydrolysis of seaweed Porphyra haitanensis polysaccharides by the enzyme produced oligosaccharides with degree of polymerisation of two to four, whose monosaccharide composition was 58% galactose, 4% glucose and 38% xylose. The oligosaccharides revealed 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical as well as hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity.

All aquaculture experiments were conducted at The University of Melbourne, Australia. Artificial feed was supplied ad libitum to the fed group, and no feed was supplied to the starved group. A modified metabolite extraction protocol using deuterated solvents was developed for 1H-NMR-based metabolite profiling of digestive gland in response to the short-term feeding/starvation experiment, to avoid lyophilisation prior to biochemical analysis. PLS-DA revealed that fed and starved abalone are metabolically distinct from each other after 28 and 56 days. After 28 days, the fed group was defined by an increase in arginine, glucose, glutamate, glycine, inosine and uracil (P < 0.05), and the starved group was defined by an increase in N,N-dimethylglycine. After 56 days, the fed group still displayed increased glucose (P < 0.05), while N,N-dimethylglycine remained elevated in the starved group (P < 0.05). Arginine and glycogen were all higher at 28 days compared to 56 days, suggesting decreased anaerobic energy production at the later time point. Only glucose and N,N-dimethylglycine were significantly different between the fed and starved groups after 56 days, suggesting that abalone had not acclimatised to the starvation treatment after 28 days. These results infer N,N-dimethylglycine is a robust marker for short-term starvation in abalone. 1H-NMR was also conducted on the artificial feed and starved abalone faecal matter, revealing the biochemical differences between them and digestive gland tissue.

Disturbances were (a) turning over the feeder plate, (b) moving and shaking the feeder plate and (c) briefly lifting the basket containing the abalone out of the water. Abalone in the control treatment were not subjected to disturbance. Activity levels of abalone were elevated in the first 1–2 nights post-disturbance with 2–3 times more abalone appearing on the walls of the baskets and larger numbers on the feeder plate than in the control treatment. Feed uptake was not influenced by treatment. Thus, even minor disturbances resulted in increased activity.

H. diversicolor supertexta is characterized by rapid growth, a short breeding cycle, suitability for high density cultivation, and is nutritious, so there is high demand among consumers. Guangdong is often affected by typhoons, so more rain falls there than in other provinces. Sea salinity drops when rainfall increases, and the osmotic pressure in aquatic animals varies because of salinity changes, which can result in massive mortalities of abalone. H. diversicolor supertexta is a local species in Guangdong, making it particularly susceptible. Response surface methodology (RSM) is a collection of statistical and mathematical techniques to optimize a process. This methodology generates an empirical mathematical model that defines the effect of an independent variable on a response of interest to optimize the response. RSM has been applied in ecotoxicological studies of marine bivalve larvae and to investigate the effects of environmental variables on embryonic and larval development. RSM has not been used in any gastropod nutritional studies. In this study, the synergistic effects of salinity and stress duration on alpha-amylase gene expression were assessed using central composite design and RSM. The results show that the linear effects of salinity on alpha-amylase gene expression were not significant (P > 0.05), but the linear effect of stress duration was significant (P < 0.05), suggesting that expression of the amylase gene was affected by stress duration. In addition, the quadratic effects of salinity on amylase gene expression were significant (P < 0.05), but the quadratic effects of stress duration on amylase gene expression were not significant (P > 0.05). No synergism was detected between salinity and stress duration. The RSM model equation for the relationship between amylase gene expression and the two factors was established (R2=80.05%). The Adj. R2 value was 65.80%, and the Pre. R2 values was 50.18%, suggesting a good model fit for prediction. Maximal amylase gene expression was observed when salinity was 31, and stress duration was 36 h.

The lined shore crab Pachygrapsus crassipes (Randall, 1840) is an abundant denizen of sheltered and exposed intertidal habitats in the northeast Pacific from Canada to Mexico. This study examined potential P. crassipes predation on juvenile mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), whelks [Nucella ostrina (Gould, 1852)], and abalone [Haliotis rufescens (Swainson, 1822)] due to conflicting reports on the diet of this species. Crabs consumed more juvenile mussels and abalone than seaweed (Ulva lactuca) and fed preferentially on the smallest mussels (6- to 10-mm size class). Further experiments showed that predation on mussels by P. crassipes was highly size dependent, with the largest crabs consuming over twenty-five 15-mm mussels per day. Field outplant experiments revealed that P. crassipes consumed high numbers of juvenile mussels in a natural setting, meaning that it could substantially affect mussel recruitment.

Brokordt K.; González R.; Farías W.; Winkler F.E.; Lohrmann K.B.,First insight into the heritable variation of the resistance to infection with the bacteria causing the withering syndrome disease in Haliotis rufescens abalone,2017,Journal of Invertebrate Pathology,150,,15,20,,"Withering syndrome disease has experienced worldwide spread in the last decade. This fatal disease for abalone is produced by a rickettsia-like organism (WS-RLO), the bacterium “Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis”. To evaluate the potential of the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) to improve its resistance to infection by WS-RLO, the additive genetic component in the variation of this trait was estimated. For this, the variation in infection intensity with WS-RLOs and WS-RLOv (phage-infected RLOs) was analyzed in 56 families of full-sibs maintained for three years in a host-parasite cohabitation aquaculture system. A WS-RLO prevalence of 65% was observed in the analysed population; and from the total WS-RLO inclusions 60% were hyperparasited with the phage (WS-RLOv). The decrease in the food ingestion rate was the sole negative effect associated with increasing WS-RLO intensity of infection, suggesting that the high level of WS-RLOv load may have diminished the symptoms of WS disease in the analyzed abalones. The estimated heritabilities were moderate to mid, but significant, varying from 0.21 to 0.23 and 0.36 for WS-RLO and WS-RLOv infections, respectively. This suggests that variation in resistance to infection with WS-RLO may respond to selection in the evaluated red abalone population. Estimated response to selection (G) for the level of infection by WS-RLO indicated that if the 10% of red abalone with the lowest infection level is selected as broodstock, a 90% reduction in the intensity of infection in the progeny can be expected, even with the lowest estimation of heritability (h2 = 0.21). This strong response would be also due to the large phenotypic variance of this trait. Strong positive correlations, both phenotypic and genotypic, were observed between infection intensities with WS-RLO and WS-RLOv, indicating that selection to increase resistance to one of the types of RLOs will affect resistance in the other in the same direction. This is the first study that demonstrates the existence of additive genetic variation for resistance to WS-RLO in abalone. Consequently, it is possible to increase the resistance to WS-RLO in H. rufescens by selective breeding, which can be an economically attractive and environmentally friendly manner to reduce mortalities and growth effects caused by WS in abalone farms. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.jip.2017.08.014,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028823583

We successfully assembled whole full-length cDNA sequences and constructed a transcriptome database that included isoform information. After clustering, a total of 15,110 and 12,145 genes that coded for proteins were identified in female and male abalones, respectively. A total of 13,057 putative orthologs were retained from each transcriptome in abalones. Overall Gene Ontology terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analyzed in each database showed a similar composition between sexes. In addition, a total of 519 and 391 isoforms were genome-widely identified with at least two isoforms from female and male transcriptome databases. We found that the number of isoforms and their alternatively spliced patterns are variable and sex-dependent. This information represents the first significant contribution to sex-preferential genomic resources of the Pacific abalone. The availability of whole female and male transcriptome database and their isoform information will be useful to improve our understanding of molecular responses and also for the analysis of population dynamics in the Pacific abalone. © 2017 by the authors.

Lord J.P.; Barry J.P.; Graves D.,Impact of climate change on direct and indirect species interactions,2017,Marine Ecology Progress Series,571,,1,11,,"Recent marine climate change re - search has largely focused on the response of individual species to environmental changes in - cluding warming and acidification. The response of communities, driven by the direct effects of ocean change on individual species as well the cascade of indirect effects, has received far less study. We used several rocky intertidal species including crabs, whelks, juvenile abalone, and mussels to determine how feeding, growth, and interactions between species could be shifted by changing ocean conditions. Our 10 wk experiment revealed many complex outcomes which highlight the unpredictability of community-level responses. Contrary to our predictions, the largest impact of elevated CO2 was reduced crab feeding and survival, with a pH drop of 0.3 units. Surprisingly, whelks showed no response to higher temperatures or CO2 levels, while abalone shells grew 40 % less under high CO2 conditions. Massive non-consumptive effects of crabs on whelks showed how important indirect effects can be in deter mining climate change responses. Predictions of species outcomes that account solely for physiological responses to climate change do not consider the potentially large role of indirect effects due to species interactions. For strongly linked species (e.g. predator-prey or competitor relationships), the indirect effects of climate change are much less known than direct effects, but may be far more powerful in reshaping future marine com munities. © The authors and Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute 2017.",10.3354/meps12148,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020390720

Although seven STAT members have been reported in mammals, very limited information on STAT genes in molluscans is available. In this study, we identified and characterized a STAT paralog that is homologous to STAT5 from the disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus, and designated as AbSTAT5. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence for AbSTAT5 (790 amino acids) with other counterparts revealed conserved residues important for functions and typical domain regions, including the N-terminal domain, coiled-coil domain, DNA-binding domain, linker domain, and Src homology 2 (SH2) domains as mammalian counterparts. Analysis of STAT phylogeny revealed that AbSTAT5 was clustered with the molluscan subgroup in STAT5 clade with distinct evolution. According to the genomic structure of AbSTAT5, the coding sequence was distributed into 20 exons with 19 introns. Immunologically essential transcription factor-binding sites, such as GATA-1, HNF, SP1, C/EBP, Oct-1, AP1, c-Jun, and Sox-2, were predicted at the 5'-proximal region of AbSTAT5. Expression of AbSTAT5 mRNA was detected in different stages of embryonic development and observed at considerably higher levels in the morula and late veliger stages. Tissue-specific expressional studies revealed that the highest level of AbSTAT5 transcripts was detected in hemocytes, followed by gill tissues. Temporal expressions of AbSTAT5 were analyzed upon live bacterial (Vibrio parahemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes), viral (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus), and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (lipopolysaccharides and Poly I:C) stimulations, and significant elevations indicated immune modulation. These results suggest that AbSTAT5 may be involved in maintaining innate immune responses from developmental to adult stages in the disk abalone. Further, this study provides a basis for structural and functional exploration of STAT members in the invertebrate JAK/STAT signaling pathway. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.dci.2015.11.012,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949642639

Different radical scavenging activities of the extracts from fermented H. discus hannai with C. militaris mycelia (FHCM) were assessed by electron spin resonance. The antioxidant potential of FHCM was also determined on the basis of a ferric reducing antioxidant power assay and 2,2’-azinobis-(3-ethybenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging activity. Higher antioxidant and radical scavenging activities were observed in FHCM than in the unfermented C. militaris mycelia or H. discus hannai alone. FHCM demonstrated an anticancer activity against melanoma B16F10 cell line. In addition, FHCM co-treatment with doxorubicin showed an increased anticancer effect in both in vitro and in vivo.

The dry MA (Undaria pinnatifida and Laminaria japonica)were also prepared to compare with the effects of formulated diets on the performance of abalone to achieve the industry standard. About 84,000 juvenile abalone were distributed into twelve 5-ton tanks (7,000 abalone per tank). The diets were fed to abalone once a day to satiation. At the end of the 16-wk feeding trial, abalone were subjected to various stress (air exposure, sudden salinity, and temperature changes) conditions and cumulative mortality was monitored. Weight gain and specific growth rate of abalone fed the all formulated diets were higher than the dry MA. The cumulative mortality of abalone fed the MA was higher than that of abalone fed the all formulated diets at the end of observation after sudden salinity and temperature changes. In conclusion, the well-formulated diets produced better growth performance of abalone over the dry MA.

In the present study, we hypothesised that kelp supplementation in formulated feed affects the profile of digestive enzymes in farmed Haliotis midae. Commercially reared sub-adult abalone fed a kelp-supplemented (Ecklonia maxima; 0.88% dry weight) or kelp-free control feed were collected for analysis of the amylase, alginate lyase, laminarinase, fucoidanase and protease activities in the gut. Levels of polysaccharidase and protease activity did not significantly differ between the diet treatments. However, enzyme-activity levels were more variable in abalone fed the kelp-free diet as compared with those fed the kelp-supplemented diet (coefficients of variation: 73%, 48.3–60.2% and 31.9% [control diet] versus 42.7%, 13.6–33.8% and 14.6% [KS diet] for amylase, macroalgal polysaccharidases and acid protease activity, respectively). We suggest that the presence of dietary kelp modulates the abalone's gut bacteria and their nutrient exchange. Proteomic identification of proteins in abalone gut sections showed that exogenous enzymes associated with the gut microbiome aid in bacterial utilisation of digested molecules, whereas abalone endogenous enzymes degrade the macronutrients in formulated feeds. © 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd.",10.2989/1814232X.2017.1329166,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029508726

Refinement procedures focused on the application of additional binder (sodium alginate), use of different feed forms (molo and noodle forms), and incorporation of Spirulina spp. as alternate protein source in partial replacement of other protein sources. Groups of 22 postlarval abalone with mean initial shell length (SL, 29 ± 0.01 mm) and weight (5.67 ± 0.06 g), harvested from the mollusc nursery of Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center, Aquaculture Department in Tigbauan, Iloilo, were stocked each as replicate in five plastic trays measuring 31.7×43.5×9.0 cm. The trays were suspended in five 1×2×1-m concrete land-based tanks representing the five dietary treatments. Abalone were fed either the refined formulated diet,molo form(RF-M), refined formulated diet, noodle form(RF-N), unrefined formulated diet, noodle form(UF-N), unrefined formulated diet, molo form (UF-M), and seaweed (NF), as the reference diet. Formulated diets and natural food were given at 2%-3% and 10%-15% (wet weight) of the body weight, respectively, once daily at 1600 h for 180 days. Water qualitymeasurements weremaintained at desired levels. A flow-through filtered seawater systemwith continuous aeration was provided in each tank. A parametric one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's post hoc test were used to test the differences in abalone SL, weight gain (WG), and specific growth rate (SGR) while nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used for daily growth increase in SL (DGSL) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) among the various dietary treatments. Percent diet water stability and apparent digestibility coefficient for dry matter (ADMD) and apparent digestibility of seaweed as ingredient were, likewise assessed. A Hedonic scale taste test analysis was done to assess differences in abalone meat quality. Highest mean WG (239.17% ± 26.05%), mean SL increase (91.51% ± 3.28%), DGSL (2,296.67m/day), SGR (4.04 ± 0.27) were attained with abalone fed RF-N. Values, however, were not significantly different (P > 0.05) for all growth parameters in RF-M except for percent increase in SL at 74.25 ± 3.11. Abalone given UF-N and UF-M showed significantly lower mean WG and SL. Survival was high and was significantly different (P < 0.05) between treatments. The highest FCR was obtained with abalone fed seaweeds. Apparent digestibility for dry matter of both the RF and UF were high at 95.67% ± 1.17% and 95.95% ± 0.45%, respectively. Apparent digestibility of ingredient seaweed was 99.4% ± 1.38%. Regression analysis of data showed better percent water stability for RF (57%; R2 = 0.954) compared with UF (38%; R2 = 0.790) after 24 h. Meat quality of the final product assessed through Hedonic scale taste testing and one-way ANOVA did not show any significant variations in taste, texture, color, odor, and general acceptability. Results have demonstrated that the refinement done on the formulated feed may enable the abalone to grow to its marketable size of about 5-6 cm in a shorter culture period (180 days) in concrete land-based tanks.",10.2983/035.035.0309,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991795095

The goal of our study is to determine if XFZYD, TMGTY or WDD treatment ameliorated myocardial fibrosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and to identify the mechanisms underlying any beneficial effects observed during the courses of the investigation. Methods: Forty-five 12-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats and five age-matched male Wistar-Kyoto control rats were studied for 16 weeks. Each day 6 g·kg-1 or 12 g·kg-1 of XFZYD, TMGTY or WDD was orally administered at the indicated dose, and the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of all rats was measured using the tail-cuff method. Collagen levels were measured via hydroxyproline content assays and histological examination. Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) protein levels were determined via immunhistochemical and Western blot analysis. TGF-β1 mRNA levels were assessed using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: Systolic blood pressure was unaffected, but collagen and TGF-β1 levels in SHRs treated with captopril and XFZYD (12 g·kg-1) were significantly reduced when compared with untreated control SHRs. Administration of 12 g·kg-1 XFZYD increased myocardial cell protection and decreased TGF-β1 mRNA and protein expression when compared with the other SHR treatment groups. Conclusions: XFZYD treatment demonstrated a superior ability to reverse myocardial fibrosis when compared with WDD or TMGTY treatment in SHRs. XFZYD also decreased TGF-β1 mRNA and protein expression, suggesting that the TGF-β1 signaling pathway plays a role in the therapeutic effects of XFZYD treatment. © 2016 Zhang et al.",10.1186/s12906-016-1030-3,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957059417

In order to understand cellular pathways associated with metal regulation and stress responses in Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), this study was aimed to isolate the genetic determinant of abalone MTF-1 and to examine its expression characteristics under basal and experimentally stimulated conditions. Results: The abalone MTF-1 shared conserved features in zinc-finger DNA binding domain with its orthologs; however, it represented a non-conservative shape in presumed transactivation domain region with the lack of typical motifs for nuclear export signal (NES) and Cys-cluster. Abalone MTF-1 promoter exhibited various transcription factor binding motifs that would be potentially related with metal regulation, stress responses, and development. The highest messenger RNA (mRNA) expression level of MTF-1 was observed in the testes, and MTF-1 transcripts were detected during the entire period of embryonic and early ontogenic developments. Abalone MTF-1 was found to be Cd inducible and highly modulated by heat shock treatment. Conclusion: Abalone MTF-1 possesses a non-consensus structure of activation domains and represents distinct features for its activation mechanism in response to metal overload and heat stress. The activation mechanism of abalone MTF-1 might include both indirect zinc sensing and direct de novo synthesis of transcripts. Taken together, results from this study could be a useful basis for future researches on stress physiology of this abalone species, particularly with regard to heavy metal detoxification and thermal adaptation. © 2017 The Author(s).",10.1186/s41240-017-0055-y,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021630344

Each of the five diets and a commercial feed were randomly assigned to three containers each stocked with 1000 juvenile Pacific abalone (2 g per individual) in a flow-through seawater system for a 5-mo feeding trial. Test results showed: (1) all the supplements significantly (P < 0.05) increased percentages of dark-brown shelled abalone in the test treatments, relative to the control treatment; (2) the abalone fed the experimental diets achieved significantly (P < 0.05) greater final weight, shell-length growth rates, and higher meat protein contents than those fed the commercial feed (P < 0.05); and (3) the abalone fed the Spirulina-supplemented diet achieved the best overall growth, pigmentation performances, and feed conversion ratio; and the Pacific dulse supplement generated the highest protein content in abalone meat product (P < 0.05) among the tested diets.

A new species, Anoplodiscus hutsonae n. sp. is proposed for museum specimens originally collected from species of Scolopsis Cuvier (Nemipteridae) off Heron Island and Lizard Island, Australia. Additionally, Anoplodiscus tai Ogawa, 1994 is synonymised with Anoplodiscus cirrusspiralis Roubal, Armitage & Rohde, 1983 due to a lack of support for differential characters, and Anoplodiscus richiardii is considered a species inquirenda. Anoplodiscus cirrusspiralis causes visible lesions on the skin and fins of its host, and may also contribute to poor food conversion rates in sparid aquaculture. Anoplodiscus cirrusspiralis has been recorded from cultured sparids in Australia, Japan, South Africa, and South Korea, and was implicated as a disease agent in fish from the former two countries. However, the discovery of A. cirrusspiralis on Chrysoblephus gibbiceps (Valenciennes), Ch. laticeps (Valenciennes) and Cymatoceps nasutus (Castelnau) in South Africa, ?Pagrus major (Temminck & Schlegel) in South Korea, and P. auratus (Forster) in Australia, New Zealand and Japan suggests that this species may have a wide distribution and low host-specificity within the Sparidae. In South Africa, A. cirrusspiralis was first encountered on a morbid C. nasutus and Ch. gibbiceps from two public aquaria in 2009 (Two Oceans Aquarium, Cape Town and uShaka Sea World, Durban, respectively).

MAPK1 is a member of the extracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERKs), playing roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and development. This is mainly in response to growth factors, mitogens, and many environmental stresses. In the current study, we have characterized the structural features of a homolog of MAPK1 from disk abalone (AbMAPK1). Further, we have unraveled its expressional kinetics against different experimental pathogenic infections or related chemical stimulants. AbMAPK1 harbors a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 23 bps, a coding sequence of 1104 bps, and a 3' UTR of 448 bp. The putative peptide comprises a predicted molecular mass of 42.2 kDa, with a theoretical pI of 6.28. Based on the in silico analysis, AbMAPK1 possesses two N-glycosylation sites, one S_TK catalytic domain, and a conserved His-Arg-Asp domain (HRD). In addition, a conservative glycine rich ATP-phosphate-binding loop and a threonine-x-tyrosine motif (TEY) important for the autophosphorylation were also identified in the protein. Homology assessment of AbMAPK1 showed several conserved regions, and ark clam (Aplysia californica) showed the highest sequence identity (87.9%). The phylogenetic analysis supported close evolutionary kinship with molluscan orthologs. Constitutive expression of AbMAPK1 was observed in six different tissues of disk abalone, with the highest expression in the digestive tract, followed by the gills and hemocytes. Highest AbMAPK1 mRNA expression level was detected at the trochophore developmental stage, suggesting its role in abalone cell differentiation and proliferation. Significant modulation of AbMAPK1 expression under pathogenic stress suggested its putative involvement in the immune defense mechanism. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.fsi.2016.10.031,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994032267

In addition to exhibiting spiral cleavage and early cell fate determination, trochozoans typically undergo indirect development, which contributes to the most unique characteristics of their ontogeny. The indirect development of trochozoans has provoked discussion regarding the origin and evolution of marine larvae and is interesting from the perspective of phylogeny-ontogeny correspondence. While these phylo-onto correlations have an hourglass shape in Deuterostomia, Ecdysozoa, plants and even fungi, they have seldom been studied in Trochozoa, and even Lophotrochozoa. Here, we compared the ontogenetic transcriptomes of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas (Bivalvia, Mollusca), the Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai (Gastropoda, Mollusca), and the sand worm Perinereis aibuhitensis (Polychaeta, Annelida) using several complementary phylotranscriptomic methods to examine their evolutionary trajectories. The results revealed the late trochophore stage as the phylotypic phase. However, this basic pattern is accompanied with increased use of new genes in the trochophore stages which marks specific adaptations of the larval body plans. © The Author(s) 2016.",10.1038/srep34664,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990203451

The gut microbiota of mice without treatment (blank), alcohol treatment (control), and alcohol+AVPH treatment (sample) were profiled with Illumina sequencing of the V4 region of 16S rDNA genes. The sequencing results revealed that 705, 654, and 888 of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were determined in the blank, control, and sample groups, respectively. Compared with the control and blank groups, the AVPH had a higher diversity index and a larger number of reads subjecting to Bacilli (class), Lactobacillales (order), Lactobacillaceae (family), and Lactobacillus (genus) levels.

One thousand two hundred and sixty juvenile abalone were randomly distributed into the 18 L plastic rectangular containers. Five experimental diets in triplicate were prepared. The 28% fishmeal was included into the control (Con) diet. The 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% fishmeal were substituted with the combination of graded levels of dry NO biomass residue and casein, referred to as the NO25, NO50, NO75 and NO100 diets respectively. Finally, the salted sea tangle (ST), Laminaria japonica was prepared to compare the effect of the experimental diets on performance of abalone. The essential amino acids, such as isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, threonine and valine tended to increase with dietary substitution of fishmeal with NO biomass residue in the experimental diets. Arginine tended to decrease with dietary substitution of fishmeal with NO biomass residue. Survival of abalone fed the experimental diets was higher than that of abalone fed the ST diet for 16 weeks. Weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone fed the NO100 diet were higher than those of abalone fed the all other diets. Weight gain and SGR of abalone linearly increased with dietary substation of fishmeal with NO. Shell length of abalone tended to increase with dietary substitution of fishmeal with the combined dry NO biomass residue and casein. The chemical composition of the soft body of abalone was different among treatments except for moisture content. In conclusion, fishmeal in the diets for abalone could be completely replaced with the combined dry NO biomass residue and casein when the 28% fishmeal was included. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",10.1111/are.12562,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027942855

It participates in the host immune defense via phagocytosis, signal transduction, cell-cell communication, proliferation, and migration of immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Hence, CTSZ is also acknowledged as an acute-phase protein in host immunity. In this study, we sought to identify the CTSZ homolog from disk abalone (AbCTSZ) and characterize it at the molecular, genomic, and transcriptional levels. AbCTSZ encodes a protein with 318 amino acids and a molecular mass of 36 kDa. The structure of AbCTSZ reveals amino acid sequences that are characteristic of the signal sequence, pro-peptide, peptidase-C1 papain family cysteine protease domain, mini-loop, HIP motif, N-linked glycosylation sites, active sites, and conserved Cys residues. A pairwise comparison revealed that AbCTSZ shared the highest amino acid homology with its molluscan counterpart from Crassostrea gigas. A multiple alignment analysis revealed the conservation of functionally crucial elements of AbCTSZ, and a phylogenetic study further confirmed a proximal evolutionary relationship with its invertebrate counterparts. Further, an analysis of AbCTSZ genomic structure revealed seven exons separated by six introns, which differs from that of its vertebrate counterparts. Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) detected the transcripts of AbCTSZ in early developmental stages and in eight different tissues. Higher levels of AbCTSZ transcripts were found in trochophore, gill, and hemocytes, highlighting its importance in the early development and immunity of disk abalone. In addition, we found that viable bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes) and bacterial lipopolysaccharides significantly modulated AbCTSZ transcription. Collectively, these lines of evidences suggest that AbCTSZ plays an indispensable role in the innate immunity of disk abalone. © 2017",10.1016/j.gene.2017.07.007,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029769549

In this study, we identified a lipopolysaccharide- and β-1,3-glucan-binding protein (LGBP) gene from the pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai (HDH), which is involved in the pattern recognition mechanism and plays avital role in the defense mechanism of invertebrates immune system. The HDH-LGBP cDNA consisted of a 1263-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 420 amino acids, with a 20-amino-acid signal sequence. The molecular mass of the protein portion was 45.5 kDa, and the predicted isoelectric point of the mature protein was 4.93. Characteristic potential polysaccharide binding motif, glucanase motif, and β-glucan recognition motif were identified in the LGBP of HDH. We used its polysaccharide-binding motif sequence to design two novel antimicrobial peptide analogs (HDH-LGBP-A1 and HDH-LGBP-A2). By substituting a positively charged amino acid and amidation at the C-terminus, the pI and net charge of the HDH-LGBP increased, and the proteins formed an α-helical structure. The HDH-LGBP analogs exhibited antibacterial and antifungal activity, with minimal effective concentrations ranging from 0.008 to 2.2 μg/mL. Additionally, both were toxic against human cervix (HeLa), lung (A549), and colon (HCT 116) carcinoma cell lines but not much on human umbilical vein cell (HUVEC). Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis showed that HDH-LGBP analogs disturb the cancer cell membrane and cause apoptotic cell death. These results suggest the use of HDH-LGBP analogs as multifunctional drugs. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",10.3390/md14120227,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007472533

The obtained particle mixtures were characterized using X-ray crystallography as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Aragonite nanoparticles retained their crystal structure even after 14 h of ball milling. The long-Term stability of the particle mixtures varied as a function of the ball-milling duration. An increased milling time led to rod-like stable assemblies of aragonite nanoparticles. Selected area electron diffraction investigations revealed that the longitudinal axes in about one-Third of these nanoparticle rods were oriented along the crystallographic c-Axis of aragonite, indicating oriented attachment of the aragonite nanoparticles.

Ares G.; Jaeger S.R.,A comparison of five methodological variants of emoji questionnaires for measuring product elicited emotional associations: An application with seafood among Chinese consumers,2017,Food Research International,99,,216,228,,"Product insights beyond hedonic responses are increasingly sought and include emotional associations. Various word-based questionnaires for direct measurement exist and an emoji variant was recently proposed. Herein, emotion words are replaced with emoji conveying a range of emotions. Further assessment of emoji questionnaires is needed to establish their relevance in food-related consumer research. Methodological research contributes hereto and in the present research the effects of question wording and response format are considered. Specifically, a web study was conducted with Chinese consumers (n = 750) using four seafood names as stimuli (mussels, lobster, squid and abalone). Emotional associations were elicited using 33 facial emoji. Explicit reference to “how would you feel?” in the question wording changed product emoji profiles minimally. Consumers selected only a few emoji per stimulus when using CATA (check-all-that-apply) questions, and layout of the CATA question had only a small impact on responses. A comparison of CATA questions with forced yes/no questions and RATA (rate-all-that-apply) questions revealed an increase in frequency of emoji use for yes/no questions, but not a corresponding improvement in sample discrimination. For the stimuli in this research, which elicited similar emotional associations, RATA was probably the best methodological choice, with 8.5 emoji being used per stimulus, on average, and increased sample discrimination relative to CATA (12% vs. 6–8%). The research provided additional support for the potential of emoji surveys as a method for measurement of emotional associations to foods and beverages and began contributing to development of guidelines for implementation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.foodres.2017.04.028,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019735537

In this study, three novel C1qDC proteins were identified from the disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) transcriptome database and designated as AbC1qDC1, AbC1qDC2, and AbC1qDC3. The cDNA sequences of AbC1qDC1, AbC1qDC2, and AbC1qDC3 consisted of 807, 1305, and 660 bp open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 269, 435, and 220 amino acids (aa), respectively. Putative signal peptides and the N-terminal gC1q domain were identified in all three AbC1qDC proteins. An additional predicted motif region, known as the coiled coil region (CCR), was identified next to the signal sequence of AbC1qDC2. The genomic organization of the AbC1qDCs was determined using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library. It was found that the CDS of AbC1qDC1 was distributed among three exons, while the CDSs of AbC1qDC2 and AbC1qDC3 were distributed between two exons. Sequence analysis indicated that the AbC1qDC proteins shared <40% identity with other counterparts from different species. According to the neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree, the proteins were grouped within an invertebrate group with high evolutionary distances, which suggests that they are new members of the C1qDC family. Higher expression of AbC1qDC1 and AbC1qDC2 was detected in hepatopancreas, muscle, and mantle tissues compare to the other tissues analyzed, using reverse transcription, followed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) using SYBR Green, whereas AbC1qDC3 was predominantly expressed in gill tissues, followed by muscles and the hepatopancreas. The temporal expression of AbC1qDC transcripts in gills after bacterial (Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes) and lipopolysaccharide stimulation indicated that AbC1qDCs can be strongly induced by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species with different response profiles. The results of this study suggest that AbC1qDCs are involved in immune responses against invading bacterial pathogens. © 2016",10.1016/j.fsi.2016.07.010,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978709086

In a 12-week study, the effects of age, water temperature and dietary protein levels on digestive enzyme activity in greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) were investigated. One- and 2-year old abalone were fed diets with crude protein (CP) levels from 24 to 36% (18.0-28.6% digestible protein) and cultured at 14, 18 and 22°C. Diets were formulated to be isoenergetic (12.5MJkg-1 digestible energy) and isolipidic (3.6% crude lipid). Trypsin, α-amylase and lipase activities were measured, and were influenced differently by abalone age, water temperature and dietary protein levels. Lipase and α-amylase activities significantly increased as water temperatures were raised. In contrast, trypsin activity was not affected by water temperature. Trypsin activity of 2-year old abalone was significantly lower (53%) than that of 1-year old abalone. The α-amylase activities of 1-year old abalone were significantly up-regulated as dietary protein levels increased. In contrast, 2-year old abalone down-regulated α-amylase activity by 55% when fed 33% CP, compared to abalone fed 30% CP. The significant trypsin activity down-regulation in 2-year old abalone compared to 1-year old animals provides further support to reducing dietary protein for 2-year old abalone to optimise cultured greenlip abalone production. Significantly higher α-amylase activity in 1-year old abalone as starch levels were reduced indicates a compensatory effect in abalone fed carbohydrate deficient diets. Further research is recommended to optimise the protein to energy ratio for different age classes of greenlip abalone, especially when fed high dietary protein levels.Statement of relevance: Results may contribute to further diet development research. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.10.013,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945231698

There are three isozymes of AIF that have been identified to date, designated as AIF1, AIF2, and AIF3; the human AIF3 is also known as an AIF-like protein (AIFL). This study aimed to identify and characterize a homologue of AIF3 from disk abalone (AbAIF3) that belongs to the phylum Mollusca. The open reading frame (ORF) of AbAIF3 is 1749 base pairs (bp) in length and encodes a protein of 583 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 63.14 kDa. Based on our in-silico analysis, the AbAIF3 protein harbored the typical domain architecture as that of the known AIF family proteins, consisting of N-terminal Rieske and pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase domain. Comparative protein sequence analysis confirmed that AbAIF3 is a homolog of AIF3. Moreover, our phylogenetic analysis revealed that AbAIF3 had a close evolutionary relationship with the molluscan counterparts. Interestingly, AbAIF3 was shown to induce apoptosis in HEK293T cells using transfection assays followed by flow cytometric analysis. In addition, we found that AbAIF3 mRNA expression was ubiquitous in physiologically important tissues, and significantly modulated upon experimental immune stimulations in hemocytes. Collectively, our study illustrates the indispensable role of AbAIF3 in inducing apoptosis in disk abalones, which in turn might be involved in hosts' immune defense mechanisms against microbial infections. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.fsi.2015.10.006,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945534847

Expression differences were observed in muscle samples from the four groups with 673±21.0 stained spots for H. discus hannai ♀ × H. discus hannai ♂ (DD), 692±25.6 for H. gigantea ♀ × H. gigantea ♂ (GG), 679±16.2 for H. discus hannai ♀ × H. gigantea ♂ (DG) (F 1 hybrid) and 700±19 for H. gigantea ♀ × H. discus hannai ♂ (GD) (F 1 hybrid). Different 2-DE image muscle protein spots had a mirrored relationship between purebreds and the F 1 hybrid, suggesting that all stained spots in F 1 hybrid muscle were on 2-DEs from parents. DD and DG clustered together first, and then clustered with GD, whereas the distance of DD and GG was maximal according to hierarchical cluster analysis. We identified 136 differentially expressed protein spots involved in major biological processes, including energy metabolism and stress response. Most energy metabolism proteins were additive, and stress-induced proteins displayed additivity or over-dominance. In these 136 identified protein spots, hybrid offspring with additivity or over-dominance accounted for 68.38%.

The isolates were screened qualitatively and quantitatively according to their ability to hydrolyse nutrients (i.e. proteins, starch and alginate), produce acid and resist bile salts. Based on the screening results, we developed a multi-strain conglomerate of 2- and 3- probiotic bacterial strains that were supplemented into a commercial abalone feed to use in our experiments. The 2-probiotic conglomerate consisted of Exiguobacterium JHEb1 and Vibrio JH1, and the 3-probiotic conglomerate consisted of Exiguobacterium JHEb1, Vibrio JH1 and Enterococcus JHLDc. The probiotic feeding trial involved abalone juveniles (20-30 mm in maximum shell length). Both probiotic feeds significantly improved abalone growth compared to that of the unsupplemented feed. The 3-probiotic supplemented feed produced a significant shell length increase of 20.9%, a wet weight gain of 19.8% and a five-fold reduction in mortality compared to the controls.

Their shell is composed of calcium carbonate, and it is formed by the mollusk in a unique structure of interlocking tablets called nacre, also known as mother of pearl. There has been much interest in the interactions between tablets, but there are also structural growth lines that occur between layers of nacre that have been unnoticed by other researchers. With these additional non-nacre layers, the material's strength is increased. We show how abalones can be cultured with changes in temperature to adjust shell and nacre growth.

Temperate abalone farmers face issues with tank restocking with highly marketable abalone owing to inefficient spawning induction methods. The identification of key proteins in sexually mature abalone will serve as the foundation for a greater understanding of reproductive biology. Addressing this knowledge gap is the first step towards improving abalone aquaculture methods. Proteomic profiling of female and male gonads of greenlip abalone, Haliotis laevigata, was undertaken using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Owing to the incomplete nature of abalone protein databases, in addition to searching against two publicly available databases, a custom database comprising genomic data was used. Overall, 162 and 110 proteins were identified in females and males respectively with 40 proteins common to both sexes. For proteins involved in sexual maturation, sperm and egg structure, motility, acrosomal reaction and fertilization, 23 were identified only in females, 18 only in males and 6 were common. Gene ontology analysis revealed clear differences between the female and male protein profiles reflecting a higher rate of protein synthesis in the ovary and higher metabolic activity in the testis. Biological significance: A comprehensive mass spectrometry-based analysis was performed to profile the abalone gonad proteome providing the foundation for future studies of reproduction in abalone. Key proteins involved in both reproduction and energy balance were identified.

The causative agent, 'Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis', occurs along the eastern Pacific margin of North America in California, USA, and Baja California, Mexico. However, as infected abalones have been transported to Chile, China, Taiwan, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Spain, Thailand and Japan, the geographical range of the etiological agent is suspected to be broad, especially where California red abalones Haliotis rufescens are cultured or in areas where native species have been exposed to this species. Susceptibility varies among species, with up to 99% losses of black abalone H. cracherodii in laboratory and field studies in the USA to no losses among the small abalone H. diversicolor supertexta in Thailand. Some populations that have suffered catastrophic losses due to WS have developed resistance to the disease. In addition, a newly identified phage hyperparasite of the WS-RLO may reduce pathogenicity and dampen associated losses. Diagnosis of WS requires the identification of infection with the pathogen (WSRLO detected via in situ hybridization or histology coupled with PCR and sequence analysis) accompanied by morphological changes that characterize this disease (e.g. pedal and digestive gland atrophy, and digestive gland metaplasia). A quantitative PCR assay was developed and may be useful in quantifying pathogen DNA.

While marine reserves are commonly used to mitigate risks to marine populations, the duration, size, location and larval connectivity needed for a reserve to help conserve genetic resources is still poorly understood. Here, we examine the effects of fishing, reserves, and restocking on the genetic diversity of 10 populations from central Baja California, Mexico, and Southern California, USA. We demonstrate that each population shows characteristic genetic signatures according to recent management decisions. We found high allelic diversity, particularly rare alleles, a larger effective population size and a lack of a recent genetic bottleneck in pink abalones within a small (0.8km2), recently established (5 years) reserve in Baja California, compared to other fished sites after a climatic bottleneck. Higher diversity may result from the presence of older animals in the reserve. Due to its location, the reserve may also act as an important hub connecting distant populations via larval dispersal. In contrast, a population from California showed genetic isolation, loss of allelic diversity and high relatedness, consistent with the collapse of fisheries in the 1990s and their lack of recovery thereafter. In addition, a fished area in Baja California with a history of restocking for over a decade showed an increase in frequency of related individuals and high genetic differentiation from nearby sites that were consistent with the production of larvae from a few adults in the laboratory. A network of strategically placed small marine reserves that considers ocean circulation patterns could help to maintain genetic diversity and connectivity of exploited populations. © 2015 The Authors.",10.1016/j.gecco.2015.07.005,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938064155

LPS (5mg/kg body weight) produced hepatic damage that was manifested by significant increases in the activities of marker enzymes (aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase) and reduced antioxidant (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, malondialdehyde) activities. These antioxidant activities were elevated by HDE administration to LPS-treated rats. These results suggested that HDE extracts had a potential hepatoprotective effect in LPS-induced liver damage without any acute toxicity. In addition, reducing power of the extracts and their ability to scavenge free radicals were evaluated by applying DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS [2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt]. This study demonstrates that these extracts have potential hepatoprotective activity which is mainly attributed to the antioxidant potential. Practical Applications: Pacific abalone is an important marine food resource in many Asian countries. A number of experimental studies have demonstrated numerous health benefits of Pacific abalone. In South Korea, abalone has important economic significance as a food and as a functional food. In addition, numerous recent research studies have focused on the nutritional and pharmaceutical values of abalone. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1111/jfbc.12131,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930570976

Abalones, a type of large marine gastropods, are the most commercially important species in aquaculture for Asia. To evaluate the potential ecological risk posed by temperature stress, we measured biological responses such as survival rate, adhesion ability (falling rate), and foot abnormalities in the abalone Haliotis discus hannai. Additionally, biochemical and molecular responses were evaluated in H.discus hannai exposed to various temperature gradients. The survival rate was reduced in abalones exposed to relative high temperatures (more than 26°C). Increased temperature stress induced a higher falling rate and abnormal foot structure. Furthermore, increased antioxidant enzyme activities were observed in abalones exposed to relative high temperatures (26 and 28°C). The activities of superoxide dismutase were induced in a time-dependent manner after high temperature stress. Generally, heat shock protein 90 also increased significantly in H.discus hannai exposed to temperature gradients (more than 24°C) for 12h. These results provide valuable information regarding stress responses to increased temperatures, in H.discus hannai: adverse biological and molecular outcomes could be utilized as risk assessments and stress monitoring of marine ecosystems under increased water temperatures. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.fsi.2014.10.036,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919640078

A detailed bioeconomic model was constructed, which allows the combination of the biological, technological, and economic aspects of genetic improvement. This research focuses on analyzing various traits through an aggregate breeding value and selection index. In this study, the traditional formula of annual genetic gain is used to allow a detailed analysis of biomass future behavior in terms of the intertemporal evolution of the traits analyzed. The results showed that the production program of genetic management in Australian abalone is profitable but only in the very long term, and it is influenced mainly by the progressive increase in the biomass of each abalone and the survival rate. Sensitivity analysis showed that the weight at harvest is the most important trait, suggesting that it is more beneficial for a farmer to focus on genetically improving this trait. In addition, reproductive factors (especially survival from competent larvae until sexual maturity) had a particularly strong impact on the results, much more than the factors related to genetic improvement and economics, such as the discount rate and selling price. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",10.1007/s10499-014-9764-8,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920472580

Shrimp was fed 28days by five experimental diets - i) control diet with no probiotics, ii) three probiotic diets, i.e. feed supplemented with 107cellg-1 of D4 (D4 diet), D7 (D7 diet) and D15 (D15 diet), and iii) mixed diet comprising of strains D4, D7 and D15 at a ratio of 2:1:1, dosed at 107cellg-1. Results showed that growth of shrimp, i.e. final weight, weight gain, percent weight gain and specific growth rate, was improved after 28-days of feeding regime with probiotics compared to the control. Respond of several non-specific immune parameters of groups fed probiotics was also enhanced; i.e. diet D4 and D15 led to significant enhancement of both respiratory burst and superoxide dismutase activities than that of control. Moreover, the respiratory burst activity was also enhanced by mixed diet at the end of 28days. All probiotic groups were able to increase acid phosphatase activity of shrimp between days 7 and 21. Moreover, the expression of prophenoloxidase and <beta>-1, 3-glucan-binding protein was significantly up regulated in shrimp fed D4 and D15 diets compared to control group, but penaeidin 3 expression up regulated significantly only with mixed diet after 28days. The cumulative mortality of shrimp, experimentally challenged with Vibrio harveyi, was reduced in groups fed probiotics, i.e. D4=36.67%, D7=41.67%, D15=13.33% and mixed=11.67%, respectively, than that of controls (43.33%) after 10days of post-infection.

In this research we develop and analyse a matrix population model for the New Zealand blackfoot pāua (abalone) Haliotis iris. Preliminary calculations for one population of H. iris yielded a population growth rate (PGR) of 16%. However due to uncertain parameter values we trialled larval settlement rates that resulted in population growth rates (PGRs) from 0 to 17%. The results showed that specific knowledge about settlement rate and juvenile survival was unimportant for the relative influence of these life-history parameters on this deterministic matrix model. Survival of the larger adults consistently had the highest sensitivity and elasticity, however in a rapidly growing population survival of the smaller animals gained importance. Also, the somewhat arbitrary placement of the shell length division between the two classes of adults created changes, with larger classes having higher elasticities. In addition elasticity, (indicating effect on the population growth rate) was concentrated in the older adults. However sensitivity, (with its greater emphasis on evolutionary change) placed more emphasis on slightly younger adults. These findings suggest that survival of larger adult paua, which is the stage typically targeted for harvest, is a key factor in fishery productivity, restoration, and conservation of the species. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.fishres.2013.11.008,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893673308

Pressurization at 200 MPa caused a decrease in pH and shear force compared to those in the control but thereafter increased with increasing pressure levels. Water holding capacity (WHC) of abalone decreased when pressurized at > 400 MPa. A greater reduction in shear force was observed after 1 week of storage. For color, reduction in the a* value of abalone was considerable during storage. Increasing pressure suppressed the generation of total volatile basic nitrogen compounds and total viable counts, whereas lipid oxidation occurred with increasing pressure. Pressurization at 200 MPa was the optimum pressure condition in which the shelf-life of abalone was extended to about 10 days compared to 3 days in the control. Industrial relevance For the use of high pressure as a pasteurization technique, commercial system is required not to exceed 5 min of holding time for the system maintenance purpose. In addition, this process is carried out under ambient temperature for the economical aspect. The abalone which is normally consumed as raw state in East Asia has very short shelf-life (< 3 days) during chilled storage, hence increasing the shelf-life for 7-8 days has been challenged for commercial distribution of the abalone. This study provided one of the strategies to extend shelf-life of abalone with minimal quality changes by high pressure processing. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.ifset.2014.02.011,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901983892

Both products have substantial market demand and if the wastes of the abalone can be used as food for the sea cucumber, then both economic and sustainability goals could be addressed. Designing a simple but effective containment structure suitable for both animals, however, requires both engineering and scientific approaches. The first objective of this study was to investigate the flow field and dissolved oxygen exchange within two potential structure designs using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The second objective was to conduct a laboratory experiment, with the same containment structures, to determine if the sea cucumbers would use organic matter (food residues and feces) as a food source produced from the abalone and would show positive growth rates. The design of both containment structures included surfaces for both species to reside and move around. One of the structures utilized vertical plates with access holes between sections (called the UC) while the other was a combination of tube and plate sections (called the TC). The procedure included placing both structures in separate seawater flow through tank systems each with juvenile abalone and sea cucumbers for 7. months. The intent was to examine the growth rates of each set of animals under the same, external flow field conditions. During the experiments, only the abalone was fed.The CFD calculations were verified with tank measurements and indicated better dissolved oxygen exchange in the UC structure. Results of the sea cucumber growth experiments showed that the animals in the UC structure grew to 7.50. g from an initial wet weight value of 3.37. g. In the TC structure, however, the results were not as promising with total growth measured at 1.4. g from an initial wet weight of 3.61. g.During the 202. day experiment, specific growth rates of 0.40 and -. 0.47% in the UC and TC, were calculated respectively. For the abalone, a statistically significant growth rate difference was not evident between the containment structures. The study also found that the juvenile sea cucumber actually fed on biodeposits from the abalone and that the substantial difference in growth rates between structure types was due to the better flow rate in the UC. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.07.001,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939265479

Concerns over the long-term supply of macroalgae have led farmers to investigate the suitability of various formulated feeds, however there has been limited commercial adoption. Combination diets of macroalgal and formulated feed fed together provide a mechanism to explore and adapt to formulated feed use without entirely abandoning macroalgal feed. The current study evaluated the use of formulated, macroalgal and two combination diets (low and high macroalgal supplementation) on production indicators and canning yields of juvenile abalone H. rufescens in a culture system modified for formulated feed. The macroalgal diet and the high macroalgal-formulated pellet combination diet (76.1% macroalgae: 23.9% pelleted diet as dry weight) produced significantly higher growth indicators (SGR and LGR) than the low macroalgal-formulated pellet combination diet (31.6% macroalgae: 68.4% pelleted diet as dry weight) and the formulated pellet diet. The protein efficiency ratio of the experimental treatments was positively related to the proportional contribution of fresh macroalgae in the diet. Furthermore, calculation of the protein efficiency ratio of the formulated component in combination diets (PER. f) revealed a significant positive relationship between macroalgae contribution and PER. f. This suggests that the increase in total PER is driven by the increased utilisation of protein in the formulated component of combination diets associated with increasing levels of fresh macroalgal supplementation. We suggest possible reasons why the presence of seaweed increased the availability of the formulated feed protein to the abalone. A simulated canning trial highlighted a significant positive linear relationship between meat canning yield and the proportional contribution of formulated feed. This study highlights the value of combination diets as a tool for abalone producers to harness the potential production advantages of macroalgae while still accessing the processing benefits associated with nutrient dense formulated feed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.06.016,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84934894997

However, in addition to this principal role, they can also function in multiple host defense processes, including cell phagocytosis and hydrolysis of peptidoglycans (PGNs). In this study, a novel invertebrate short-type PGRP was identified in disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) designated as AbPGRP. The complete coding sequence of AbPGRP was 534bp, encoding a 178-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 20kDa. The AbPGRP gene had a bipartite arrangement consisting of two exons separated by a single intron. Homology analysis revealed that AbPGRP shares conserved features, including amino acid residues critical for substrate and ion binding as well as for its amidase activity, with homologs of other species. Phylogenetic analysis of AbPGRP revealed that it likely evolved from a common ancestor of invertebrates, having significant homology with other molluscan PGRPs. Recombinant AbPGRP exhibited detectable, dose-dependent PGN-hydrolyzing activity with the presence of Zn2+, and strong antibacterial activity against Vibrio tapetis, consistent with the functional properties previously reported for PGRPs in other mollusks. Moreover, AbPGRP transcription was induced upon treatment of healthy abalones with bacterial peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide, although the expression profiles differed with treatment, suggesting a capacity for discriminating between bacterial pathogens through molecular pattern recognition. Collectively, the findings of this study indicate that AbPGRP is a true homolog of invertebrate PGRPs and likely plays an indispensable role in host immunity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.fsi.2014.04.018,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901377219

Further, larval development stages were similar in RR, JJ and RJ hybrid abalones. Among the experimental trials, settlement rate varied from 12.3% to 18.6% and final survival from 20.1% to 31.7%, being the RJ hybrid rates intermediate between parental species. The final shell lengths were similar between RR and RJ hybrids, but significantly higher in JJ abalones.

Brokordt K.B.; González R.C.; Farías W.J.; Winkler F.M.,Potential response to selection of HSP70 as a component of innate immunity in the abalone Haliotis rufescens,2015,PLoS ONE,10,11,,,e0141959,"Assessing components of the immune system may reflect disease resistance. In some invertebrates, heat shock proteins (HSPs) are immune effectors and have been described as potent activators of the innate immune response. Several diseases have become a threat to abalone farming worldwide; therefore, increasing disease resistance is considered to be a long-term goal for breeding programs. A trait will respond to selection only if it is determined partially by additive genetic variation. The aim of this study was to estimate the heritability (h2) and the additive genetic coefficient of variation (CVA) of HSP70 as a component of innate immunity of the abalone Haliotis rufescens, in order to assess its potential response to selection. These genetic components were estimated for the variations in the intracellular (in haemocytes) and extracellular (serum) protein levels of HSP70 in response to an immunostimulant agent in 60 full-sib families of H. rufescens. Levels of HSP70 were measured twice in the same individuals, first when they were young and again when they were pre-harvest adults, to estimate the repeatability (R), the h2 and the potential response to selection of these traits at these life stages. High HSP70 levels were observed in abalones subjected to immunostimulation in both the intracellular and extracellular haemolymph fractions. This is the first time that changes in serum levels of HSP70 have been reported in response to an immune challenge in molluscs. HSP70 levels in both fractions and at both ages showed low h2 and R, with values that were not significantly different from zero. However, HSP70 induced levels had a CVA of 13.3-16.2%in young adults and of 2.7-8.1% in pre-harvest adults. Thus, despite its low h2, HSP70 synthesis in response to an immune challenge in red abalone has the potential to evolve through selection because of its large phenotypic variation and the presence of additive genetic variance, especially in young animals. © 2015 Brokordt et al.

The present study characterized an initiator caspase (. HrCas8) and an effector caspase (. HrCas3) from the red abalone Haliotis rufescens using the RACE method and qPCR analysis. HrCas8 showed a complete sequence of 2529 base pairs (bp) with an open-reading frame (ORF) of 1911bp, a 5'UTR of 201bp, and a 3'UTR of 417bp. The estimated molecular mass for the 636 amino acids from HrCas8 was 71.5kDa with an isoelectric point of 6.2. The HrCas8 sequence had two death-effector domains (DEDs) and the subunits p20 and p10, in addition to an active site characteristic of cysteine proteins. Meanwhile, the effector caspase HrCas3 showed a complete sequence of 1404bp, a 5'UTR of 82bp, and a 3'UTR of 574bp. The ORF of this caspase had 747bp that coded for 248 residues. Moreover, the predicted molecular mass of HrCas3 was 29.4kDa; the theoretical isoelectric point was 5.70, and the sequence evidenced a conserved caspase recruitment domain (CARD). The distribution of the caspases in distinct tissues revealed that HrCas8 was principally expressed in the hemolymph, while HrCas3 had a higher expression in the gills. A basal level of expression was found for both caspases in muscle tissue. The immune response of caspases in H.rufescens was evaluated through an injection of Vibrio anguillarum. The results showed an increase in the transcription of HrCas8 post-challenge, as well as an activation of HrCas3, which together suggest the initiation of apoptosis as a response to bacterial infection in H. rufescens. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.fsi.2014.04.027,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901310615

Here we investigated the feeding behaviour of juvenile greenlip abalone, Haliotis laevigata; fed live macroalgae and formulated diets at different rations; and observed their feeding behaviour using a novel ventral video monitoring technique. Four different diets (commercial chip, experimental flake, Ulva sp. and Gracilaria cliftonii) at two feeding rations (excess vs. restricted) were tested. Diet type had no effect on abalone movement, but macroalgal diets resulted in higher feed intakes. Restricting feed rations induced greater movement. Abalone moved little during the light period and moved mostly during darkness, except for animals on the restricted feed ration where feeding commenced during the light period. On farms, this phenomenon may be a useful behavioural indicator for identifying underfed abalone. Despite their lower intake, formulated diets promoted higher energy and nutritional intake, indicating that quantity of feed consumed is not solely indicative of nutritional gain. From a research perspective, the novel ventral monitoring method has created opportunities for further behavioural studies in molluscs. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",10.1080/10236244.2014.990701,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84918491814

Six purified diets were formulated to contain tripalmitin (TP), olive oil (OO, 72.87% 18:1n-9), grape seed oil (GO, 68.67% 18:2n-6), linseed oil (LO, 70.48% 18:3n-3), ARA oil (AO, 41.81% ARA) or EPA oil (EO, 44.09% EPA and 23.67% DAH). No significant difference in survival rate was observed among abalone fed with different diets. Weight gain rate (WGR) and daily growth rate of shell length (DGRSL) were significantly increased in abalone fed with diets containing OO, AO and EO, but decreased in abalone fed with LO diet (P < 0.05) in comparison with those fed with TP. High level of dietary 18:2n-6 resulted in higher content of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in abalone fed with GO than those fed with TP, OO, LO and EO (P < 0.05). n-3 PUFAs in abalone fed with LO was significantly higher than those in abalone fed with TP, OO, GO and AO (P < 0.05). The highest contents of 20:1n-9 and 22:1n-9 were observed in abalone fed with OO. The expression of Δ5 Fads in hepatopancreas of abalone was enhanced by high concentration of 18:3n-3 and suppressed by dietary LC-PUFAs; however it was not affected by dietary high concentration of 18:1n-9 or 18:2n-6. These results provided valuable information for understanding the synthesis of LC-PUFAs and nutritional regulation of Δ5 Fads expression in abalone. © 2015, Science Press, Ocean University of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s11802-015-2356-z,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923220741

This model was based on observations taken on previously demineralized shells, where the original structure had disappeared.

We have applied different labeling protocols on non-demineralized nacreous shells of the bivalve Pteria. With this method, we have revealed the disposition and nature of the different fibers of the interlamellar membranes that can be observed on the surface of the nacreous shell of the bivalve Pteria hirundo by high resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The minor chitin component consists of very thin fibers with a high aspect ratio and which are seemingly disoriented. Each fiber has a protein coat, which probably forms a complex with the chitin. The chitin-protein-complex fibers are embedded in an additional proteinaceous matrix. This is the first time in which the sizes, positions and distribution of the chitin fibers have been observed in situ. © 2015 Osuna-Mascaró et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0122934,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929353460

Long-term survival (>2 years) of hatchery-reared and released abalone, their impact on wild abalone abundance, and the effect of diffuse versus concentrated release was investigated on natural reefs. Long-term survival of released hatchery abalone varied between releases but averaged about that expected for wild abalone. There was no significant effect of released juveniles on the persistence or recruitment of wild abalone. Significantly greater numbers of all (released and wild) abalone persisted at release locations through time, while the total number of wild abalone increased significantly through time at release and control locations. There was no significant difference in long-term survival of abalone released in clusters of high density (2-4%) or in a diffuse or concentrated array (0-9%).

A laboratory experiment showed that 1-year-old juveniles had one internal growth ring that was deposited during the season of lowest seawater temperature. Tagged juveniles (2 years old) were released into their natural habitat and recaptured after 2-5 years from the date of release. The recaptured individuals (n=3) had the same number of internal growth rings as their age in addition to one disturbance ring. Results of stable oxygen isotope analysis on the shell cross-sections confirmed that the growth rings were deposited between winter and spring when the temperature decreased below 7°C. Furthermore, the disturbance rings that were observed only in the released individuals were formed at the time of release into the natural habitat. Comparing the validity of the age determination method developed in this study with the conventional burning shell method, the age estimated by the conventional method was less than that by the present method for ≥8-year-old abalone.

In this study, abalone viscera hydrolysates (AVH) were prepared using Alcalase, Flavourzyme, Neutrase, and Protamex, and their oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) was evaluated. The AVH by Alcalase showed promising ORAC value, and further optimal enzyme/substrate hydrolysis condition for production of the AVH was determined. The AVH also exerted strong hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity, Fe2+ chelating activity, and reducing power. Furthermore, the AVH inhibited lipid peroxidation in a model system and protected hydroxyl radical-induced DNA damage. Amino acid profiles revealed that the AVH contained 57.1% antioxidant amino acids and 44.0% hydrophobic amino acids, which contributed to its higher antioxidant activity. In addition, the AVH showed cytoprotective effects against hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity of cultured hepatocytes, and significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and membrane lipid peroxidation. Taken all together, these results suggest that the AVH might be useful as an ingredient for functional foods. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.jff.2015.04.023,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937562299

Both extracts were administered at 50mg/kg and evaluated for their anti-inflammatory effects. Histological evaluations indicated that HDE1 effectively suppressed colonic tissue damage in mice with DSS-induced colitis. In addition, the expression levels of immune-related cytokines and transcription factors such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ), phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (pSTAT1), interleukin-4 (IL-4), phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (pSTAT6) and Gata3 were also downregulated by both extracts. These results indicated that both HDE1 and HDE2 suppressed inflammatory cytokines and mediators. However, histological examinations clearly suggested that HDE1 had greater efficacy in attenuating colonic tissue damage by DSS than HDE2. Therefore, HDE1 may be a potential anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Practical Applications: Pacific abalone is an important marine food source in many Asian countries. The health benefits of Pacific abalone have been demonstrated in a number of studies. This study investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of Pacific abalone extracts in a mouse model of ulcerative colitis. An ethanol extract (HDE1) of Pacific abalone potently suppressed the mucosal tissue damage and crypt loss in the colons of mice exposed to DSS. In addition, inflammatory cytokines and mediators were effectively suppressed by HDE1. Therefore, HDE1 may be a potential therapy for ulcerative colitis. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1111/jfbc.12118,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930574717

Rainbow trout silage oil was prepared from farmed rainbow trout processing waste, included at 25gkg-1 in a formulated diet and compared to a control diet in a 153day growth trial. It was found that rainbow trout silage oil addition significantly improved abalone cellular immune function by increasing hemocyte phagocytic activity from 48.8% in the control diet to 65.2% in the silage oil diet. However, production performance was negatively impacted: specific growth rate (SGR) and final animal weight were decreased 17% and 5.6% respectively, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) increased by 25.1%. Foot muscle fatty acid profile and proximate composition were unaffected. It is concluded that dietary fish silage oil inclusion can improve cellular immune function in H. midae, but that the optimal inclusion level should be determined in order to negate the negative effects on production efficiency. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.03.040,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898925254

Thus, parentage analysis is a useful tool to establish pedigree reports in molecular-assisted selection programs. Here, we evaluated 10 heterologous microsatellite markers for parentage assignment in abalone hybrids produced from 43 abalone broodstocks of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and Japanese abalone (H. discus hannai). The allele frequencies, exclusion probabilities and broodstock contributions were calculated using CERVUS, PAPA and GERUD software. The polymorphic information content (PIC) values showed that most of the microsatellite loci were highly informative (>0.7) and more than 90% of parentage assignment was possible with a minimum of 5-6 microsatellite markers. Parentage assignment for hybrid and pure-red progeny showed a better performance than pure-Japanese progeny. This result could be due to the high level of allele loss in the parental genotypes. In addition, results indicated that only two sires contributed over 80% and 90% of red and hybrid progenies, respectively.

Adaptive response to such changes, and planning for their occurrence, requires an understanding of the underlying drivers and system responses as well as appropriate monitoring. In addition to field studies, modelling can advance our ability to anticipate or deal with such major ecosystem shifts. Here, we used an existing multi -species model with smooth continuous functions that were modified to include thresholds representing 3 alternative scenarios of predator responses when prey numbers drop below a critical threshold: (I) no threshold-like response; (II) an abrupt decrease in breeding success by 90%, and (III) an abrupt halving of adult survival. Second, we analysed field observations from 3 independent marine case studies (abalone, starfish, penguins) for evidence of abrupt non-linear responses of predators to changes in abundance of principal prey. Third, we compared the model output with empirical results and tested (using both a statistical method and by fitting multispecies models) the 3 alternative response scenarios. With this approach, we found evidence for nonlinear changes in population parameters (such as survival rate) of predators as prey numbers declined below critical thresholds. As an example of the potential for this approach to inform management, we found that abundances of a range of marine predators become more variable as prey numbers decline, which may be a useful indicator that a system is approaching a tipping point. © Inter-Research 2014",10.3354/meps10909,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907956436

One additional treatment was included at 19. °C, 126% oxygen, where feed was supplemented with l-proline. The results presented here suggest that long-term 19. °C exposure is more stressful to H. midae juveniles than a 14. °C exposure of the same duration, since exposure to higher temperature generally resulted in higher activities of the antioxidant enzymes measured but lower total antioxidant capacities. Haemolymph glucose levels responded to oxygen treatment at the 14. °C exposure, but the same response was not initiated in the 19. °C treatment, possibly because the animals exposed to the 19. °C treatment relied on proteins to a larger extent.Increased oxygen levels at the 19. °C treatment did not cause more DNA damage or protein carbonylation compared to lower oxygen levels. Supplementing feed with l-proline at the high temperature/high oxygen treatment caused a decrease in haemolymph haemocyanin (which may exhibit catalase function) content and a slight decrease in some of the antioxidant enzyme activities, while maintaining the same total antioxidant capacity compared with the same treatment where feed was not supplemented. The overall DNA integrity profile also changed with proline-supplementation, as did the induction level of hsp70. When projecting tissue growth over a 12. month period under these conditions, we estimate that H. midae juveniles in this study may exhibit a significant increase in mass when their feed was supplemented with l-proline, indicating that l-proline supplementation provides some benefit to the individual. It might therefore warrant conducting long-term growth trials on land-based mariculture facilities to further investigate its potential benefit to the mariculture industry. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.09.031,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885346627

This study explored the potential impact of the proposed disposal of over 7 million m3 of dredge spoil on a nearby fishery for the blackfoot abalone Haliotis iris. The range of sediment deposition predicted by models to occur on reefs inhabited by H. iris as a result of the dispersal of sediment from the disposal site was used to design controlled experiments between July and September 2011 to test the likely effects of sedimentation on: (a) behaviour and mortality of juvenile H. iris and (b) photosynthetic vitality of crustose coralline algae (CCA) that form nursery habitats for H. iris obtained from Brinns Point (45, 40. 3′S, 170, 39. 4′E). We observed no direct effects on the health or mortality of H. iris juveniles or the photosynthetic vitality of habitat forming CCA. H. iris did, however, avoid sediments by moving from predation refugia beneath cobbles to vertical surfaces on cobble edges significantly more often in sediment treatments compared to sediment-free controls. Deposited sediments were also found to inhibit righting response, key behaviour in allowing H. iris to reattach to the substratum following dislodgement. Results of this study suggest that indirect mortality from reductions in available refugia from predation and inability to recover from dislodgement could be significant. These results highlight the importance of understanding indirect impacts of stressors on key ecological processes in order to predict ecological responses. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s00227-013-2173-0,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876439541
Mann K.; Jackson D.J.,Characterization of the pigmented shell-forming proteome of the common grove snail Cepaea nemoralis,2014,BMC Genomics,15,1,,,249,"Background:With a diversity of pigmented shell morphotypes governed by Mendelian patterns of inheritance, the common grove snail, Cepaea nemoralis, has served as a model for evolutionary biologists and population geneticists for decades. Surprisingly, the molecular mechanisms by which C. nemoralis generates this pigmented shelled diversity, and the degree of evolutionary conservation present between molluscan shell-forming proteomes, remain unknown.Results:Here, using next generation sequencing and high throughput proteomics, we identify and characterize the major proteinaceous components of the C. nemoralis shell, the first shell-proteome for a pulmonate mollusc. The recent availability of several marine molluscan shell-proteomes, and the dataset we report here, allow us to identify 59 evolutionarily conserved and novel shell-forming proteins. While the C. nemoralis dataset is dominated by proteins that share little to no similarity with proteins in public databases, almost half of it shares similarity with proteins present in other molluscan shells. In addition, we could not find any indication that a protein (or class of proteins) is directly associated with shell pigmentation in C. nemoralis. This is in contrast to the only other partially characterized molluscan-shell pigmentation mechanism employed by the tropical abalone Haliotis asinina.Conclusions:The unique pulmonate shell-forming proteome that we report here reveals an abundance of both mollusc-specific and pulmonate-specific proteins, suggesting that novel coding sequences, and/or the extensive divergence of these sequences from ancestral sequences, supported the innovation of new shell types within the Conchifera. In addition, we report here the first evidence that molluscs use independently evolved mechanisms to pigment their shells. This proteome provides a solid foundation from which further studies aimed at the functional characterization of these shell-forming proteins can be conducted. © 2014 Mann and Jackson; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1471-2164-15-249,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897514264

In South Africa, the recently introduced polychaete Boccardia proboscidea has been recorded at the outflow of abalone farms where they are known to infest the shells of these mollusks. To determine if B. proboscidea can become established along the South African coast and subsequently expand its range, we assessed brood size, larval size at hatching, larval survivorship and developmental time and rate of this species under temperature regimes reflective of those found along the coast. We also investigated similar temperature dependent development in the well-established non-indigenous shell borer Polydora hoplura which can serve as a proxy for our predictions. Worms were cultured in glass capillary tubes at five different temperature treatments (12. °C, 17. °C, 21. °C, 24. °C, 28. °C) and planktotrophic and adelphophagic larvae were tracked from oviposition to settlement. We found that in P. hoplura, females producing adelphophagic larvae had smaller broods at the highest temperature treatment and higher temperatures resulted in significantly larger sizes at hatching. Survivorship of planktotrophic and adelphophagic larvae was highest at the intermediate to high temperature treatments (21. °C and 24. °C) and was generally lower at the lower temperatures (12. °C and 17. °C). Temperature had no significant effect on brood size of B. proboscidea whereas higher temperatures resulted in larger hatching sizes for planktotrophic and adelphophagic larvae. In B. proboscidea, larval types showed differences in survival optima with planktotrophic larvae exhibiting its highest survivorship at the colder temperatures and lowest at the warmer temperatures while adelphophagic larvae had its highest survivorship at 21. °C and its lowest at the extreme temperatures. There was a positive relationship between temperature and developmental rate for both species. The difference in larval sizes of the non-feeding planktotrophic larvae of B. proboscidea was attributed to a growth window that allowed for variability in reproductive traits based on exogenous factors such as temperature. More importantly, the results indicate that B. proboscidea will be capable of producing viable populations at different localities along the South African coast including those where P. hoplura has already been established. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jembe.2014.07.012,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907062204

E. arborea is the kelp with the largest and most southerly latitudinal distribution on the North Pacific East Coast capable of growing at higher temperatures and in relatively low nutrient conditions. The availability of M. pyrifera is frequently uncertain because it is strongly affected by El Niño events. In order to test E. arborea as a diet for farmed abalone, animals of two different sizes (6 and 2 cm) were fed separately for 12 months with these two seaweed species. The abalones were cultured in cages in an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture farm within San Quintín Bay, Baja California, Mexico. Seaweed was collected for chemical analysis, and every 3 months, animals were measured and weighed to estimate growth. Small size abalone doubled their size on both diets, with an average increase in length of 2.2 mm month−1. No significant differences were observed between both treatments. Large abalone fed with M. pyrifera had slighter higher growth rates compared to those fed with E. arborea (0.57 and 0.50 % day−1, respectively). Although M. pyrifera appeared to be a better diet for large animals, the growth rates obtained with E. arborea and the fact that this species could be cultivated in warmer conditions makes this seaweed species a good candidate to feed farmed abalone. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",10.1007/s10811-013-0138-9,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883726075

GIE time of greenlip abalone was evaluated using a marker diet containing chromic oxide and the total faecal collection technique. Additionally, GIE values were compared from samples collected from abalone that were sampled once only or repeatedly to compare the rigour of each method. GIE time was also assessed using radiography. GIE times were significantly affected by water temperature (P<. 0.001) and age (P<. 0.05). GIE times decreased for both age classes with increasing temperatures, and the GIE time of 2-y-olds was significantly faster than for 3-y-olds. GIE times never exceeded 60. h. There was no significant effect of either factor on the duration that the marker diet was voided, suggesting that differences in GIE times are due to factors other than the transit of feed through the intestine. Dry matter ADCs were not affected by temperature (P>. 0.05) but were affected by age (P<. 0.001; 2-y-old <. 3-y-old). Protein and energy ADCs were not affected by temperature or age.

Zhang G.; Li S.; Zhang Q.; Li X.; Mu C.,Optimization of microwave-vacuum drying for detoxified starfish,2015,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,31,16,289,295,,"Starfish is widely distributed in inshore aquaculture zones in China and it is the predator for many aquaculture animals such as oyster, scallop and abalone. Since starfish has strong fecundity and regenerative capacity, the number of starfish has been growing in recent years with the development of inshore aquaculture. The annual yield of starfish has reached 50000 tons in Dalian, which seriously imperils the development of aquaculture industry. Starfish is rich in nutrients such as protein and polysaccharide, but it contains some toxic substances (such as saponin) as well. It is accordingly a potential resource for feed processing industries after being detoxified. The drying of detoxified starfish has been paid more attention because the traditional drying methods are inefficient and hardly for product quality controlling. In this paper, microwave-vacuum drying of detoxified starfish was carried out and the drying rate, product quality and energy consumption were evaluated. The influences of microwave power density (3-7 W/g), pulse time (20-60 s) and relative vacuum degree (between -0.070 and -0.090 MPa) on the drying characteristics, energy consumption and protein retention rate were firstly studied by single-variable experiments. Results showed that when the microwave power density increased from 4 to 7 W/g, the drying time reduced from 18 to 11 min, the average drying rate increased from 2.95%/min to 4.87%/min, and the energy consumption decreased from 0.0130 to 0.0054 kW·h/g, but the protein retention rate dropped to 83.06% from 92.77%; meanwhile, when drying under the pulse time of 60 s, the average drying rate, energy consumption and protein retention rate would be respectively 1.17 times, 75.16% and 97.47% of that when drying under 20 s pulse time. Similarly, drying under -0.090 MPa relative vacuum degree, the average drying rate, energy consumption and protein retention rate were 1.19 times, 68.41% and 1.09 times of that drying under -0.070 MPa, respectively. It would be more favorite by controlling the microwave power density, pulse time and relative vacuum degree respectively within 4-7 W/g, 30-60 s and -0.080--0.090 MPa. In addition, the response surface methodology (RSM) was employed for the multi-variable experiments, and the regression model was accordingly established. Results of RSM experiments demonstrated that the drying process of detoxified starfish was significantly influenced by microwave power density, followed by pulse time and relative vacuum degree. The microwave power density and the pulse time had significant effect on the comprehensive score (P<0.01). An interaction worked between the microwave power density and the pulse time on comprehensive score (P<0.05). The average drying rate of starfish, energy consumption, protein retention rate and comprehensive score would be 2.95%/min, 0.0118 kW·h/g, 93.80% and 0.751, respectively, under the drying conditions of 4 W/g microwave power density, 60 s pulse time and -0.090 MPa relative vacuum degree. Under this condition, the energy consumption of 1 kg detoxified starfish dried with microwave vacuum drying method could be saved by 8 kW·h compared to hot air drying and the drying cost of starfish could reduce by 4 RMB. Meanwhile, a higher protein retention rate and good quality of the dried detoxified starfish could be obtained by microwave vacuum drying. Microwave-vacuum drying is an effective method for detoxified starfish processing and it is a promising approach for the industrial utilization of starfish. ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was used to isolate and quantify phlorotannins, which were identified by mass spectrometry and [1H]-nuclear magnetic resonance to be the P1 compound, 7-phloroeckol, and eckol. When E. bicyclis was used as feed, P1 compound accumulated to an average of 1.60 mg/g dry weight of abalone muscle tissue after 18 d, 7-phloroeckolol to 0.21 mg/g after 16 d, and eckol to 0.22 mg/g after 12 d. Saccharina japonica was used as a control feed, and the abalone showed little or no accumulation of phlorotannins in muscle tissue. Feed consumption and growth rate were very similar when either E. bicyclis or S. japonica was fed for 20 d. Half-maximal reductions in the levels of P1 compound, 7-phloroeckol, and eckol accumulation were attained in 1.5, 1.9, and 3.4 days, respectively, after the feed was switched from E. bicyclis to S. japonica.

However, current liquid formulations have short shelf life and high risk of bacterial contamination. The aim of our study was to develop a stable functional formulation. Analytical techniques (nano-differential scanning calorimetry and spectroscopy) and biological assays (cytotoxicity and plaque reduction) were employed to measure the effect of sugar addition on the physical properties and shelf life of the solid formulated hemocyanin. Sucrose improved thermal stability significantly by both increasing the aggregation onset temperature (70 C to >78 C) and enhancing the activation energy (18%). Lyophilisation without trehalose caused degradation and unfolding of the α-helices of hemocyanin. However, the addition of an optimal proportion of trehalose:protein (5:1 by weight) prevented the degradation and unfolding during lyophilisation, hence maintained the protein solubility. The estimated ED50 values of the formulated solid (0.43 ± 0.1) and liquid samples (0.37 ± 0.06) were similar in magnitude, and were significantly lower than the respective controls; thus, confirming enhanced antiviral activity of the formulation. Formulated compounds were stable for six months at 5 C storage. The enhanced shelf life and stable antiviral activity of the formulation offers its significant potential as effective therapeutic agent in future clinical applications. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Survival, shell length, and shell width of juvenile abalone were not affected by dietary DDG levels (P > 0.05). Weight gains of juvenile abalone fed DDG15 and DDG30 diets were not different compared to DDG0, but abalone fed DDG45 and DDG60 diets gained less weight than those fed DDG0 (P < 0.05). Soft body weight/body weight ratio of juvenile abalone fed the DDG60 diet was lower than that of those fed the DDG0 diet (P < 0.05), but proximate composition of the soft body was not affected by dietary DDG levels (P > 0.05).

In order to investigate this further, the objective of this study was to localise the bacterial probiont Vibrio midae SY9 and one of the extracellular proteases it produces in the digestive tract of the South African abalone Haliotis midae. This was accomplished by inserting a promotorless gfp gene into the chromosome of the bacterium which was incorporated in an artificial, fishmeal-based abalone feed. In situ histological comparison of abalone fed either a basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with V. midae SY9::Tn10.52 using a cocktail of DNA probes to the gfp gene localised the probiont to the crop/stomach and intestinal regions of the H. midae digestive tract. Generally, the ingested probiotic bacterium occurred in association with feed and particulate matter within the crop/stomach and intestinal regions, as well as adhered to the wall of the crop/stomach. Histological immunohistochemical examination using polyclonal anti-VmproA antibodies localised an extracellular protease produced by V. midae SY9 to the H. midae crop/stomach and intestine where it appeared to be associated with feed and/or other particulate matter in the abalone gut. Thus the data suggests that V. midae SY9 colonises and/or adheres to the mucous lining of the abalone gut. Furthermore, the close association observed between the bacterium, its extracellular protease and ingested feed particles supports the theory that V. midae SY9 elevates in situ digestive enzyme levels and thus enhances feed digestion in farmed abalone. © 2014 Huddy, Coyne.",10.1371/journal.pone.0086623,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899682964

The immune-stimulating potential of two hydrolysed protein sources (self-prepared fish silage and a commercial fish protein hydrolysate) at two dietary inclusion levels in abalone diets was therefore measured in the South African abalone Haliotis midae, using animals of initial mean weight of 123g-128g. Diets containing the high inclusion levels were also fed in two feeding regimes: continuous feeding, or phase feeding, where the hydrolysed protein diets were alternated monthly with the control diet. In low inclusion diets, hydrolysate inclusion contributed 6g·kg-1 protein in the final diet, whilst in high inclusion diets this was increased to 18g·kg-1. It was found that the low inclusion level of the commercial hydrolysate significantly increased the cellular immunity through increasing the phagocytic activity of haemocytes by 18% compared to the control diet, whilst none of the other diets showed any significant differences compared to the control. Both inclusion levels of the commercial hydrolysed protein significantly improved daily weight increase of animals. Phase feeding had no positive impacts on immunity or production performance. The inclusion of both types of hydrolysed protein sources significantly decreased the water stability of feeds compared to the control, except at the lowest inclusion level of the commercial hydrolysate. It is concluded that the use of dietary hydrolysed proteins can lead to improved cellular immunity and growth in abalone, however it is important to determine appropriate inclusion levels to prevent negative impacts on feed water stability and production performance. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.03.018,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897946337

It has been associated with conditions of high water temperature (>. 23. °C), low dissolved oxygen levels, and a range of other stressful factors in the culture water during summer months. This study aimed to alleviate mortality experienced by abalone at high water temperatures (26. °C), by dietary intervention using grape seed extract (GSE) and dried Ulva lactuca Linnaeus, two products which contain antioxidative and bioactive compounds. These products were formulated into a commercial abalone diet at levels of 5 and 30%.

Overfishing not only affects the targeted species, but also potentially influences the integrity and functioning of the ecosystem through associated changes in community composition. We assessed the herbivorous effects of H. midae on the benthos through a 6-month field experiment involving exclusion/inclusion plots. This showed that benthic community composition remained largely unchanged whether H. midae was present or absent and specifically revealed no evidence that H. midae diminishes algal biomass, probably because in the region where we worked, it feeds mainly by trapping drift kelp rather than grazing on attached algae. The absence of responses to the removal of abalone was additionally evident in comparison with indices of abundance and diversity, functional groups and individual species. In the absence of abalone, there were subtle increases in the green alga Codium stephensiae and the crustose brown alga Zeacarpa leiomorpha and decreases in the four species of foliose macroalgae, but none of these effects were significant. The presence of H. midae thus had no negative grazing effects on any elements of the epilithic community composition. It does, however, have other influences, including occupation of space and provision of habitat in the form of its shell, which supports a community significantly different from the surrounding rocks. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s00227-013-2338-x,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893148118

The effect of antibiotics on larval survival was first tested within negative (filtered seawater) and positive (GABA at 10-5, 10-4and 10-3mol L-1) control assays over 3 days. This experiment corroborated the effectiveness of using antibiotics to improve survival of larvae without obvious synergistic interactions with the GABA inducer or confounding effects of potential bacterial interactions. Chemical treatments (acetylcholine, potassium chloride, dopamine and glutamine) were then tested at various concentrations for their ability to modulate swimming behaviour and induce larval attachment and metamorphosis over 14 days. Generally, larval state shifted from swimming to attached, and from attached to metamorphosed, in the control and treatments over time. However, the peak percentage of attached and metamorphosed larvae varied in time among chemicals and concentrations. While overall percent metamorphosis was minimally enhanced after 14 days of exposure to some chemical treatments at certain concentrations, all treatments displayed significant capacities to down-regulate larval swimming and induce early attachment and metamorphosis. Mortality was recorded throughout the duration of the experiment, and was generally low (<20%) across controls and most treatments for exposures of less than 12 days. Interpretations of specific results from this study are used to elucidate neurophysiological control of larval activities for this abalone species.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling is considered as a prominent signaling pathway in vertebrate as well as invertebrate species. Within the signaling cascade, TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) and TNF receptor-associated protein (TTRAP) has been shown to have a crucial role in the modulation of immune signaling in animals. Here, we attempted to characterize a novel molluskan ortholog of TTRAP (AbTTRAP) from disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) and analyzed its expression levels under pathogenic stress. The complete coding sequence of AbTTRAP consisted of 1071 nucleotides, coding for a 357 amino acid peptide, with a predicted molecular mass of 40kDa. According to our in-silico analysis, AbTTRAP resembled the typical TTRAP domain architecture, including a 5'-tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase domain. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis revealed its common ancestral invertebrate origin, where AbTTRAP was clustered with molluskan counterparts. Quantitative real time PCR showed universally distributed expression of AbTTRAP in selected tissues of abalone, from which more prominent expression was detected in hemocytes. Upon stimulation with two pathogen-derived mitogens, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), transcript levels of AbTTRAP in hemocytes and gill tissues were differentially modulated with time. In addition, the recombinant protein of AbTTRAP exhibited prominent endonuclease activity against abalone genomic DNA, which was enhanced by the presence of Mg2+ in the medium. Collectively, these results reinforce the existence of the TNF signaling cascade in mollusks like disk abalone, further implicating the putative regulatory behavior of TTRAP in invertebrate host pathology. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.fsi.2014.06.014,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903885004

Thus, there is a need to supplement the naturally available kelp biomass with the development of mariculture techniques. In this study, we investigated whether it was possible to cultivate Macrocystis pyrifera sporophytes in the laboratory using gametophyte clones. We propagated gametophytes by periodic fragmentation and then mixed aseptically an equal number of male and female gametophytes to induce fertilization. Approximately 60 days after fertilization, numerous embryonic sporophytes emerged on the seed fibre. By using chlorophyll fluorescence technology, we investigated variation in the photosystem II (PSII) characteristics of M. pyrifera during development from the gametophyte to juvenile sporophyte stage. During this growth period, both the optimal (Fv/Fm) and effective (YII) PSII quantum yields increased significantly from the haploid gametophyte to diploid sporophyte stages. In addition, by comparing female gametophytes with male gametophytes, we found that female gametophytes were not only larger and more pigmented than the males, but also recorded higher values of Fv/Fm and YII. Our results supplemented information on the life cycle and PSII photosynthetic performance during the early development and confirmed the possibility of artificial seeding technology, both of which may contribute to mariculture of M. pyrifera in China in the near future. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",10.1111/are.12327,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930819977

The mean production of E. stolonifera obtained from the culture ropes was ca. 12 kg wet wt. m-1 of culture rope while production of E. cava was ca. 3 kg wet wt. m-1 of culture rope. The difference in production was attributed from the different growth strategies of the two algae, with only E. stolonifera being able to regenerate blades from the holdfast. The ability to regenerate blades from the holdfast therefore makes E. stolonifera the preferred species for biomass production for abalone feeds.

Abalone consumed Ulva sp. at a linear rate from 4:00 PM to 8:00 AM. In contrast, the apparent feed consumption rate of abalone fed the formulated diet was minimal from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM, and was highest between 7:00 PM and 1:00 AM. Apparent feed consumption rate of abalone significantly increased as water temperature increased from 18°C to 22°C, but the effect was greater for hybrid abalone compared with greenlip abalone. The total apparent feed intake of both greenlip and hybrid abalone fed Ulva sp. was significantly greater than for both types of abalone fed the formulated diet. The total apparent feed intake on dry basis, and nutrient intake for abalone fed Ulva sp. was significantly lower than for abalone fed the formulated diet. This study indicates that the upper temperature range for feed intake in hybrid abalone is higher than in greenlip abalone. Ulva sp. can stimulate abalone feeding, though the high moisture content in algae can reduce nutrient intake.",10.2983/035.034.0318,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954174464
Shi X.; Zhao Y.; Jiao Y.; Shi T.; Yang X.,ROS-Dependent Mitochondria Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Antitumor Activity of Pleurotus abalonus Acidic Polysaccharides in Human Breast Cancer MCF-7 Cells,2013,PLoS ONE,8,5,,,e64266,"Background:A greater reduction in cancer risk associated with mushroom diet rich in fungus polysaccharides is generally accepted. Meanwhile, edible Pleurotus abalonus as a member of Abalone mushroom family is a popular nutritional supplement that purportedly prevents cancer occurrence. However, these anecdotal claims are supported by limited studies describing tumor-inhibitory responses to the promising polysaccharides, and the molecular mechanisms underlying these properties have not yet been elucidated.Methodology/Principal Findings:We here fractionated the crude polysaccharide preparation from the fruiting bodies of P. abalonus into three fractions, namely PAP-1, PAP-2 and PAP-3, and tested these fractions for antiproliferative activity in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. The largest PAP-3, an acidic polysaccharide fraction with a molecular mass of 3.68×105Da, was the most active in inhibiting MCF-7 cancer cells with an IC50 of 193 μg/mL. The changes in cell normal morphology were observed by DAPI staining and the PAP-3-induced apoptosis was confirmed by annexin V/propidium iodide staining. The apoptosis was involved in mitochondria-mediated pathway including the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), the increase of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, caspase-9/3 activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) degradation, as well as intracellular ROS production. PAP-3 also induced up-regulation of p53, and cell cycle arrest at the S phase. The incubation of MCF-7 cells with antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly attenuated the ROS generation and apoptosis caused by PAP-3, indicating that intracellular ROS plays a pivotal role in cell death.Conclusions/Significance:These findings suggest that the polysaccharides, especially acidic PAP-3, are very important nutritional ingredients responsible for, at least in part, the anticancer health benefits of P. abalonus via ROS-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. It is a major breakthrough bringing new insight of the potential use of the polysaccharides as health-care food or medicine to provide significant natural defense against human cancer. © 2013 Shi et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0064266,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877755186

Genetic techniques may help to distinguish populations that are self-sustaining from those at risk of further decline, and demographic interdependence among subpopulations. We tested the use of genetic data for identifying stable and self-sustaining abalone populations, as well as the efficacy of a restoration technique for use in those populations that are not. We created an artificial aggregation of wild adult pink abalone (Haliotis corrugata) in the Point Loma kelp forest near San Diego, CA, USA. We genetically analyzed those individuals and additional adults and juveniles in the broader region. A self-sustained population should not be demographically reliant upon immigration. Temporal variability in relatedness among juvenile cohorts, and a lack of fine-scale spatial structure in adult and juvenile relatedness indicated complex recruitment dynamics and/or long distance larval delivery. We estimated a low effective population size (Ne=188) and a very low ratio of effective population to census population size (Ne/N=2.0×10-3). These data are consistent with sweepstakes reproductive success, and suggest that the population is at risk of genetic diversity decline. Parentage assignment revealed that none of the juveniles sampled one year after aggregating adults had parents from this aggregation. Collectively, our results suggest that restoration efforts will need to achieve a greater density (0.18m-2) and/or number of individuals (46) to improve local recruitment. Our results also suggest that the Point Loma kelp forest population of pink abalone is of insufficient density for long-term viability, may be reliant upon immigration, and cannot be defined as an independent ""local"" population unit. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jembe.2014.07.004,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905240701

L-ascorbyl-2-molyphosphate (LAMP) was added to the basal diet to formulate four experimental diets containing 0.0, 70.3, 829.8 and 4967.5mg AA equivalent kg-1 diets, respectively. Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of adult abalone in acrylic tanks (200L) in a flow-through seawater system. Each tank was stocked with 15 abalone. Animals were fed once daily (17:00) to apparent satiation for 24 weeks. The results showed that the dietary AA (70.3 mg kg-1) could significantly up-regulate the expression levels of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), feritin (FT) and heat shock protein 26 (HSP26) in the hepatopancreas of abalone in this treatment compared to the controls. However, the expression levels of Mn-SOD, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx), selenium-binding protein (SEBP), HSP70 and HSP90 were significantly down-regulated. Compared with those in the group with 70.3 mg kg-1 dietary AA, the expression levels of CAT, GST and HSP26 were decreased in abalone fed with very high dietary AA (4967.5 mg kg-1). In addition, significant up-regulations of expression levels of Mn-SOD, GPX, TPx, SEBP, FT, HSP70, HSP90 and NF-κB were observed in abalone fed with apparently excessive dietary AA (829.8 and 4967.5 mg kg-1) as compared to those fed 70.3 mg kg-1 dietary AA. These findings showed that dietary AA influenced the expression levels of antioxidant proteins, heat shock proteins and NF-κB in the hepatopancreas of abalone at transcriptional level. Levels of dietary AA that appeared adequate (70.3mgkg-1) reduced the oxidative stress by influencing gene expression of antioxidant proteins, but excessive dietary AA (829.8 and 4967.5 mg kg-1) induced oxidative stress in Pacific abalone H. discus hannai. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.fsi.2014.08.026,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907680791
Ye Y.-J.; Chen J.; Weng W.-Y.,In vitro antioxidant activity of abalone viscera hydrolysates isolated by ultrafiltration,2015,Modern Food Science and Technology,31,5,130,136and284,,"Abalone viscera hydrolysates were separated by ultrafiltration, and the chemical composition and antioxidant activity of the hydrolysates in different ranges of molecular-weight were investigated. Four fractions (FA, FB, FC, and FD) were obtained by membrane ultrafiltration with molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of 10000, 3000, and 500 u. In fraction FA, total sugar and protein contents were 34.06% and 17.20%, respectively. However, fractions FB, FC, and FD were mainly composed of proteins, and the free amino acid content was 23.20, 25.47, and 28.68 g/10 g, respectively. Based on the results from tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and β-elimination, the high molecular-weight fraction (HMWF) of FA in the spacer gel contained glycoproteins with N-glycosidic linkage, and components with molecular weight of 25 ku were proteins. Gel permeation chromatography data indicated that molecular weight of the fractions FB, FC, and FD were each approximately 300 u. Additionally, the result of in vitro antioxidant assay indicated that fraction FA had a relatively strong 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging ability and reducing power at low concentration. When the concentration was increased above 5 mg/mL, there were no significant differences in the DPPH radical-scavenging abilities among these fractions, but the reducing power of fraction FA was lower than that of other fractions. In both, low and high concentrations, the hydroxyl radical-scavenging abilities of fractions FB, FC, and FD were stronger than that of FA. ©, 2015, South China University of Technology.

Six experimental diets were formulated with CS to replace SWP at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% (Con, CS20, CS40, CS60, CS80, and CS100, respectively). Abalones averaging 0.44±0.01g (mean ± SD) were distributed into 18 tanks, and fed one of the six experimental diets in triplicate for 10 wk. After the feeding trial, abalone fed CS100 had a lower weight gain (WG) and specific growth rate than abalone fed the other diets; however, there was no significant difference among abalone fed Con, CS20, CS40, CS60, and CS80. Abalone fed Con, CS20, and CS40 had a higher feed efficiency and protein efficiency ratio than abalone fed CS100 diet, although there were no significant differences among abalone fed Con, CS20, CS40, CS60, and CS80. Abalone fed CS100 had a lower whole-body crude lipid content than did abalone fed Con. Broken-line analysis for WG indicated that dietary SWP was successfully replaced by CS up to 74.8%.

Small abalone (40.38±0.31 mm shell length and 14.69±0.39 g body weight for Trial 1 and 37.66±0.33 mm SL and 13.37±0.35 g BW for Trial 2) found in the area were collected by fishers and stocked in cages (50 cm X 50 cm X 20 cm). Two trials with two treatments were conducted with five replicates per treatment. Stocking density was 15 abalone per cage. Results of Trial 1 showed that those fed with a single species diet grew from 40.30±0.45 mm to 44.67±0.38 mm in shell length and 14.71±0.57 g to19.73±0.44 g in weight whereas those fed with mixed algal diet grew from 40.45±0.47 mm to 46.74±0.79 mm in length and 14.67±0.61 g to 23.20±1.08g in total weight after 135 d in culture. There was a significant difference in length and weight after 135 d using the t-test (P<0.05). Results for trial 2 were similar in that a significant difference was observed between the two treatments after 120 d using the t-test (P<0.05). In trial 2, abalone fed with a single-species diet grew from 37.48±0.56 mm to 43.72±0.35 mm in shell length and from 13.47±0.66 g to 19.00±0.59 g in weight whereas those fed with mixed-algae grew from 37.84±0.40 mm to 44.85±0.20 mm in shell length and from 13.27±0.32 g to 20.73±0.36 g in weight. In both cases, mixed-species of red algae produced better growth in shell length and weight. This may be because abalone in the wild rarely feed on single species and they frequently encounter a variety of drift algae. It may also be due to the fact that nutrients lacking in single-species diets may be provided and/or fortified using a variety of seaweeds, which are locally abundant.

Less attention has been given to the resulting quality of the seafood product from formulated feeds and the effect of the reduction of marine ingredients in these feeds. Marine n-3 fatty acids are particularly important nutritional factors of seafood that are lacking from feed ingredients at the base of the aquaculture production chain. Considering that this important category of nutrients is already deficient in the western diet, further erosion through cultivated seafood products is of concern. This study tested the effect of three diet categories on the fatty acid profiles of commercially farmed abalone. Two commercial formulated feeds, Ulva spp. macroalgae, and combinations of the formulated feeds and macroalgae were fed to six replicate baskets of 20 abalone (~62 mm) for 12 months in Victoria, Australia. The macroalgae diets represented overall lower fatty acid content, including eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA), but higher relative amounts of alpha linolenic acid (ALA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), than the formulated feeds. The total lipid content of abalone tissue did not vary substantially across diet categories; however, the ratio of n-6:n-3 fatty acids decreased incrementally with the increasing macroalgae content in the diet and by a factor of two with a 100 % macroalgae diet. Also, equal or higher content of all important long chain n-3 fatty acids was achieved with a macroalgae diet despite the lower dietary content of some of these fatty acids. Marine fatty acid-deplete aquaculture feeds can result in decreased n-3 fatty acid content in the abalone tissue. The inclusion of macroalgae in the diet of abalone can offset this reduction. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",10.1007/s10811-015-0530-8,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942551980

Three different temperatures (12, 16 and 20. °C) were chosen to measure the effect of fatty acid accumulation or synthesis compared to the control diet. After 200. days of experimentation, abalone exhibited different growth between each temperature, whereas no differences were observed between diets. However, a higher fatty acid accumulation was observed in muscle tissue at 12. °C. The relative amount of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) in the muscle tissue was similar between those individuals fed with the restriction (LC-PUFA free) and full diets. This was clearly observed within the LC-PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), but not with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), suggesting that H. tuberculata is able to synthesize the former FAs from their precursors. This pattern was also observed with arachidonic acid (ARA). In general abalone is able to synthesize and accumulate the necessary fatty acids to sustain growth at a wide range of temperatures and dietary sources, especially at lower temperatures, that could mean that this species is able to cope with a broad range of environmental conditions. However, DHA requirement in the H. tuberculata seems to be much inferior than previously reported, and its biosynthesis is undetectable under the present experimental conditions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.07.005,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882475380

This study aimed to evaluate post release behavior, recapture and growth rates of hatchery-reared abalone juveniles released in the Sagay Marine Reserve. From the two release trials conducted, results showed that abalone of shell length >3.0 cm had lower mortality during onsite acclimation and utilized transport modules as temporary shelter for a shorter period after release. Both wild and hatchery-reared abalone preferred dead branching corals with encrusting algae as their habitat. Recapture rates were comparable between the wild (7.97%) and hatchery-reared (HR2) abalone (6.47%). Monthly growth rates were almost the same between wild (0.25 cm, 4.0 g), hatchery-reared (HR1: 0.27 cm, 4.6 g; HR2: 0.35 cm, 3.8 g) abalone.

Ninety-seven cell populations derived from 30 individuals were cultured in different media with varying compositions of medium supplements, and initial attachment, subculture, and survival for ≥10 weeks were assessed according to medium composition and individual. We also examined the time required for subculture and the rate of cell death according to both culturing period and passage number within 10 weeks. A lack of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and hemolymph significantly inhibited the growth of cultured cells, while we detected no significant effect of medium composition on initial cell attachment. Through data reallocation, with the omission of data from cell populations cultured in FBS-free and hemolymph-free media, we showed that growth inhibition was also affected by individual differences among the abalones used. During the culture, we observed four different types of cell morphology. Moreover, considerable time was required for subculture—18.4 and 19.5 days for first and second subcultures, respectively—and cell death did not occur within 30 days or for passage 0.

Seven experimental diets were formulated to contain increasing amounts (0%, 0.875%, 1.75% and 3.5%) of GO or LO as dietary lipids. Tripalmitin (TP), rich in 16:0, was supplemented to reach 3.5% (dry weight) total lipid. These diets were named as 0%GO/LO (TP), 25%GO, 50%GO, 100%GO, 25%LO, 50%LO and 100%LO. With the increase of dietary GO or LO inclusion, growth parameters (such as specific growth rate of weight) first increased and then decreased (R2>0.72, P=0.000). The survival rate of abalone was not significantly correlated with dietary GO (R2=0.04, P=0.815) or LO inclusion (R2=0.50, P=0.046). The contents of muscle n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including LA, 20:2n-6, 20:4n-6, 22:2n-6, were significantly positive correlated with dietary GO inclusion (R2>0.895, P=0.000). A positive relationship was significantly noted between the values of muscle n-3 PUFA (ALA, 20:3n-3, 20:5n-3 and 22:5n-3) and the dietary LO inclusion (R2>0.905, P=0.000). DHA was significantly increased and then decreased with dietary LO increase (R2=0.937, P=0.000). The expression levels of putative δ5 Fads in 50%GO group were significantly higher than those of other GO groups (P<0.05). With the increase of dietary LO, expressions of putative δ5 Fads first increased and thereafter reached a plateau (R2>0.929, P=0.000). These results indicated that biosynthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid in muscle of abalone could be increased in response to increasing levels of dietary LA or ALA through increased expressions of putative δ5 Fads. High intakes of dietary LA and/or ALA inhibited the biosynthesis of DHA and compromised the growth performance of abalone. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.05.013,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878431056
Hai N.V.,The use of probiotics in aquaculture,2015,Journal of Applied Microbiology,119,4,917,935,,"This study aims to present comprehensive notes for the use of probiotics in aquaculture. Probiotics have been proven to be positive promoters of aquatic animal growth, survival and health. In aquaculture, intestines, gills, the skin mucus of aquatic animals, and habitats or even culture collections and commercial products, can be sources for acquiring appropriate probiotics, which have been identified as bacteria (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) and nonbacteria (bacteriophages, microalgae and yeasts). While a bacterium is a pathogen to one aquatic animal, it can bring benefits to another fish species; a screening process plays a significant role in making a probiotic species specific. The administration of probiotics varies from oral/water routine to feed additives, of which the latter is commonly used in aquaculture. Probiotic applications can be either mono or multiple strains, or even in combination with prebiotic, immunostimulants such as synbiotics and synbiotism, and in live or dead forms. Encapsulating probiotics with live feed is a suitable approach to convey probiotics to aquatic animals. Dosage and duration of time are significant factors in providing desired results. Several modes of actions of probiotics are presented, while some others are not fully understood. Suggestions for further studies on the effects of probiotics in aquaculture are proposed. © 2015 The Society for Applied Microbiology.",10.1111/jam.12886,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942191805

As feed for abalone postlarvae, the four diatoms promoted growth under all experimental conditions. Greater shell lengths were measured on Day 14 when Navicula sp. and Navicula incerta were used as feed. Postlarvae that were fed N. incerta and Navicula sp. had higher growth rates. In contrast, lower growth rates were observed on Day 7 with fresh and stored Nitzschia thermalis as food. Survival was high in postlarvae that were fed the four stored diatoms (100%).

Diets were formulated to be isoenergetic (12.5MJkg-1 digestible energy), containing a lipid level of ~3.6% and digestible protein from 17.99 to 28.57%. Abalone were fed to excess at 16:00h daily, and uneaten feed was collected the following day. The specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone improved significantly as water temperatures increased from 14 to 17 to 20°C. In addition, apparent protein deposition was significantly higher in abalone at 17 and 20°C compared to abalone at 14°C. There was no significant effect of dietary protein level on SGR, but faster growing abalone at 20°C compensated by consuming more feed when fed low dietary protein levels. In contrast, a significant positive relationship was observed between dietary protein level and feed consumption rate in slower growing abalone at 14 and 17°C. A non-significant tendency for the apparent feed conversion ratio (FCR) to improve was observed in abalone fed high protein diets at 20°C, while at 14°C, abalone had a significantly poorer FCR, especially when fed high dietary protein levels. Based on results from the current study, it is plausible to heat land-based nursery systems in order to gain accelerated growth of juveniles before transfer to grow-out systems. Additionally, no benefits were apparent by feeding abalone high protein diets at 14 or 17°C, and we therefore recommend a dietary protein level of 29% CP at 14 and 17°C. While the SGR of abalone at 20°C was not significantly influenced by dietary protein, the feed consumption rate decreased and there was a tendency for FCR to improve as dietary protein level increased. Therefore, it may be beneficial for abalone to be switched to a diet containing ~35% CP at water temperatures >20°C. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.10.033,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84909608113
Strain E.M.A.; Johnson C.R.; Thomson R.J.,Effects of a Range-Expanding Sea Urchin on Behaviour of Commercially Fished Abalone,2013,PLoS ONE,8,9,,,e73477,"Background:Global climate change has resulted in a southerly range expansion of the habitat modifying sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii to the east coast of Tasmania, Australia. Various studies have suggested that this urchin outcompetes black-lipped abalone (Haliotis rubra) for resources, but experiments elucidating the mechanisms are lacking.Methodology/Principal Findings:We outline a new framework involving experimental manipulations and Markov chain and Pareto modelling to examine the effects of interspecific competition between urchins and abalone and the effect of intraspecific competition in abalone, assessed as effects on behaviour. Manipulations of abalone densities had no detectable effect on urchin behavioural transitions, movement patterns or resightability through time. In contrast, additions of urchins resulted in abalone shifting microhabitats from exposed to sheltered positions, an increase in the proportion of mobile abalone, and declines in abalone resightability through time relative to controls without the urchins. Our results support the hypothesis of asymmetrical competitive interactions between urchins and abalone.Conclusions/Significance:The introduction of urchins to intact algal beds causes abalone to flee and seek shelter in cryptic microhabitat which will negatively impact both their accessibility to such microhabitats, and productivity of the abalone fishery, and will potentially affect their growth and survival, while the presence of the abalone has no detectable effect on the urchin. Our approach involving field-based experiments and modelling could be used to test the effects of other invasive species on native species behaviour. © 2013 Strain et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0073477,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884496886
Huddy R.J.; Coyne V.E.,Characterisation of the role of an alkaline protease from Vibrio midae SY9 in enhancing the growth rate of cultured abalone fed a probiotic-supplemented feed,2015,Aquaculture,448,,128,134,,"South Africa has a rapidly developing abalone aquaculture industry based largely on the cultivation of Haliotis midae. The prophylactic use of probiotic microorganisms has been shown to enhance the health, growth and nutritional status of a variety of cultured aquaculture species. Furthermore, research has shown that H. midae fed a high protein artificial diet supplemented with the proteolytic marine bacterium Vibrio midae SY9 have enhanced digestive protease activity levels, protein digestion and absorption, and growth. The predominant V. midae SY9 extracellular alkaline protease, VmproA, has been previously shown to be present in the crop/stomach and intestinal regions of H. midae fed a diet supplemented with V. midae SY9. Therefore, VmproA may be responsible for the probiotic properties of the bacterium in farmed abalone. In this study, the role of VmproA on abalone growth was investigated using the mutant strain V. midae SY9Mut2, which is unable to produce VmproA. Over the course of a 180. day laboratory-based growth trial the growth rate of small (28. mm) abalone improved by 6.5 and 14.5% following dietary supplementation with V. midae SY9 and V. midae SY9Mut2, respectively, in comparison to abalone fed a basal diet. In situ protease activity within the H. midae digestive tract was significantly increased in animals fed the V. midae SY9 supplemented diet compared to abalone fed either the basal feed or the V. midae SY9Mut2 supplemented diet. Thus, VmproA does not appear to be the factor responsible for increased growth of probiotic-supplemented abalone. Statement of relevance: The manuscript addresses the mechanism of how probiotics function in a farmed abalone species. This is important since probiotic supplementation of feed is proving successful in increasing the growth of these molluscs, and yet very little is known regarding the underlying relationship between the host animal and the probiont. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.05.048,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84936802392

This study examined the dietary effects of P yezoensis versus the kelps Saccharinajaponica and Saccharina ochotensis on the growth of juvenile sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus intermedius) and abalones (Haliotis discus hannai). Urchins fed P. yezoensis had significantly higher food conversion efficiency (42.0%) and digestibility (94.9%) compared to urchins fed S. japonica. For abalone, the conversion efficiency of P yezoensis was 14.0%. No significant differences in growth rates were detected between the urchins and abalones fed P yezoensis and kelp. These results suggest that the high concentration of protein in P yezoensis contributed to the high food conversion efficiencies ofjuvenile sea urchins and abalones and the high digestibility found in sea urchins. However, it is likely that the thin thalli of P yezoensis made them difficult to graze efficiently.

Twenty eight C. acutispina were kept individually in a concrete tank with running seawater (10-28°C) and fed mussels for sixteen months. Twenty one of them divided once or more during the experiment. Forty three underwent fission. One occurred from August to December when the water temperature was relatively high (>18°C). Under controlled water temperature conditions, 90% of C. acutispina divided at temperatures> 19°C, whereas only 7 % of them divided at temperatures 13°C. Fourteen sister pairs of two small individuals derived from one sea star by fission were kept under different nutritional conditions of either starved or fed mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) ad libitum for more than a year. The starved individuals never divided, while almost all the fed sea stars divided at least once.

Three diets were formulated to contain 0% (DDG0), 30% DDG (DDG1) replacing wheat flour and 30% DDG (DDG2) replacing fish meal and wheat flour. A commercial feed (CF) was also compared with experimental diets. Three replicate groups of abalone averaging 0.6 ± 0.01 g were fed one of the four diets for 14 weeks. The highest survival rate was observed in the abalone fed the DDG2 diet, which was higher than that of abalone fed the DDG0 diet. Weight gain, shell length, shell width and soft body weight of the abalone were not affected by dietary DDG and CF diet (P > 0.05). Proximate and amino acid composition of the soft whole body were not affected by dietary DDG and CF diet (P > 0.05). The result of this experiment suggests that DDG is a good ingredient to replace fish meal and wheat flour in the diet and could be used up to 30% in the diet without negative effects on the growth performance of juvenile abalone Haliotis discus hannai. © 2015 The Korean Society of Fisheries and Aquatic Science.",10.5657/FAS.2015.0159,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937030822

Undaria is an important species for both the abalone industry and for commercial seaweed mariculture. In an attempt to extend the culture period of Undaria we bred and cultured hybrid kelp that is a cross between free-living gametophytes of U. peterseniana and Undariopsis pinnatifida. The morphological characteristics of the F1 hybrid sporophytes were intermediate between those of the parent plants having shallow pinnated blades and forming both sorus and sporophyll. A F2 generation was produced by isolating zoospores from sorus and sporophyll separately from a F1 hybrid thallus. Using free-living gametophyte seeding and standard on-growing techniques, F0 (female U. pinnatifida and male U. peterseniana), F1, and F2 gametophytes were cultured from December 2011 to May 2013. The morphological differences between the F1 and F2 generations were assessed. The F2 hybrids were found to have longer pinnate blades and narrower midribs than the F1 hybrid and only formed sporophylls. Growth and morphology of F2 hybrids originating from the sporophyll or sorus of the F1 hybrids were not morphologically different from each other. Both of the F2 hybrids exhibited late maturation, with the early stages of sporophylls appearing in April. This late maturation of F2 hybrids is beneficial in the development of hybrid strains that extend the period of availability of Undaria for abalone feed and cultivation in Korea. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",10.1007/s10811-013-0164-7,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927642289

Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. Springer-Verlag, New York, 2005, pp. 200-210), most closely related to Caedibacter taeniospiralis and Fangia hongkongensis, within the Gammaproteobacteria, comprises the single type genus Francisella Olsufjev (J Hyg Epidemiol Microbiol Immunol, 14:67-74, 1970). The genus consists of small (0.7-1.7 μm), nonmotile, Gram-negative (staining faintly), aerobic coccobacilli, which may or may not require additional cysteine (or cystine) for culture, weakly catalase positive, and most (but not all) produce H2S when cultured in cysteine-containing media. Members of the Francisella grow with entire, slightly convex pale white or gray, semitranslucent, mucoid colonies. Incubation time and temperature is dependent on species and strain, but they are relatively slowly growing. Many are capable of facultative intracellular growth. The Francisella have a trans-global distribution, although most isolates have been recovered in the Northern Hemisphere. The type species is F. tularensis, which is further divided into four subspecies, i.e., tularensis, holarctica, mediasiatica, and novicida. Subspecies tularensis and holarctica commonly called biotypes A and B, respectively, can in turn be further divided into several subpopulations based on genetic analysis. F. tularensis causes the disease tularemia in mammalian species and represents a potential category A bioterror weapon. Several members of the genus, e.g., F. noatunensis (subspecies noatunensis and orientalis) and F. halioticida, are highly virulent pathogens of fish and molluscs. These species can be readily distinguished from the remainder of the genus by their lower optimal and cardinal growth temperatures. Despite the relatively small number of described species, an increasing body of evidence exists for the existence of a large and diverse environmental population of as-yet undescribed Francisella species. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

We aimed to determine if dietary intervention could alleviate mortality demonstrated by abalone at high water temperatures. As this issue is most relevant to farm production, we aimed to demonstrate that different mortality patterns are evident for 2- and 3-year-old greenlip abalone ( Haliotis laevigata Donovan), irrespective of reproductive state, and to provide potential, practical solutions to this issue. Growth rate, feed intake and haemolymph variables were measured. To test if dietary intervention could minimise mortality at high water temperatures, we selected a commercial diet routinely fed on-farm when SM occurred, as a negative survival control, and live macroalgae ( Ulva lactuca Linnaeus) as a positive survival control. In Experiment 1, 30. mm 2-year-old and 70. mm 3-year-old abalone were subjected to water temperatures of 18, 22 and 26. °C for 36. days. In Experiment 2, 60. mm 3-year-olds were subjected to 22 and 26. °C for 38. days. In Experiment 1, survival was >. 95% for all treatments at 18 and 22. °C ( P>. 0.05); whereas, survival was significantly reduced by 35% in 3-year-olds fed the commercial diet at 26. °C compared to all other treatments ( P<. 0.05). In Experiment 2, there was no mortality at 22. °C. At 26. °C, survival was significantly reduced by 50% ( P<. 0.05) for the commercial diet, whereas, survival was >. 97% for the U. lactuca diet. We demonstrated that dietary intervention reduced mortality in larger abalone at 26. °C. We also demonstrated a pattern of mortality in response to high water temperatures that differed for age classes. This information is invaluable for further systematic research to alleviate on-farm abalone mortality associated with high summer water temperatures, particularly in the areas of nutritional or therapeutic intervention. © 2014.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.03.047,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899852877

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of one formula, named Jueyin granules (JYG) in the mouse model of the vaginal epithelium and tail epidermis. Additionally, we also determined the anti-inflammatory effects of JYG in an imiquimod- (IMQ-) induced psoriasis-like skin mouse model. Our results show that JYG can attenuate the IMQ-induced psoriasis-like inflammation, accompanied with increased epidermal hyperplasia. We also measured estrogenic stage mitosis of vaginal epithelial cells and the formation of granular cell layers in male mouse tails per 100 scales, as well as the tissue nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels using the ELISA method. The results suggest that JYG significantly inhibited mitosis in mouse vaginal epithelial cells, promoted the formation of the squamous epidermal granular layer in mice tails, and reduced the levels of NO and MDA in an imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like skin mouse model after 14 d (P < 0.05). These results demonstrate that JYG might be an effective clinical treatment for psoriasis and the effects may be related to inhibited keratinocytes proliferation, improved parakeratotic epidermal cells, and reduced expression of NO and MDA. © 2014 Tian Ma et al.",10.1155/2014/512562,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84934936700

During the development of Phase II and III, Shell adopted an innovative integrated approach for the delivery, testing, installation and commissioning of the Subsea Production System. This approach led to significant gains in operational efficiency and overall helped in the optimization of the rig schedule. Some of the critical elements for success of the Project were the alignment of hardware delivery with logistics and custom clearance activities, a fit-for-purpose test facility in Vila Velha, a dedicated Multi Purpose Supply Vessel together with its ROV services, and a dedicated multidisciplinary team which leveraged the optimization of the learning curve through the execution of the project. 17 Tubing Head Spools (THS) and 17 Subsea Trees were successfully installed in water depths up to 1850 m. by Multi-Purpose Support Vessel (MPSV) Holiday in 2 separate campaigns that spanned roughly 2 years. The MPSV with its 150 T Active Heave Compensated (AHC) Crane showed excellent performance in executing its core hardware installation activities, and was then also used on multiple additional Inspection, Maintenance and Repair (IMR) jobs, optimizing the utilization for the specific field development. Most relevant among this peripheral work were: data acquisition from a permanent seabed seismic array, support in a Gas Export line remediation project and repair of a service line jumper. Additionally, for the 7 trees of Phase III, the vessel ROVs participated in commissioning activities, communicating with the tree control system, to anticipate cycling and opening of the downhole isolation valves, resulting in further savings of rig days. For this purpose a project specific ROV kit was arranged to communicate with the tree control pod, provide fail safe double barriers during the intervention, and inject conditioning fluids inside the shallow section of the well bore.

The flow field characteristics within the abalone containment structure were analyzed with computational fluid dynamic software. The hydrodynamic response of the moored containment structure was investigated with a Morison equation type finite element model that simulates fluid-structure interaction. Environmental forcing input to the model consisted of loading conditions representing combinations of currents with a magnitude of 1.0. m/s and irregular seas with a significant wave height of 8.01. m and peak period of 12.52. s. Simulations were performed with the abalone cage model in both surface and submerged configurations. From the simulations, the attachment loads were determined and used in a structural model to calculate local stresses. Structural analysis of the deployment and recovery operation was also investigated.

The polysaccharides' compositions were analysed, and their effects on HepG2 cell proliferation were assessed. AVAP I had a greater growth-stimulatory effect than AAP or AVAP II. The oligosaccharide of AVAP I (Oli-AVAP I) exhibited the same growth effects, but rhamnose, the primary monosaccharide of AVAP I and Oli-AVAP I, did not exhibit this activity. Moreover, AVAP I dramatically reduced the mRNA levels of CDK6 and Cyclin E1 but significantly increased Cyclin B1, CDK1 and Cyclin F. Interestingly, AVAP I remained able to induce cell proliferation in a low serum concentration medium. AVAP I could therefore promote HepG2 cell proliferation by regulating gene expression and accelerating the cell cycle process. AVAP I may be useful as a serum supplement for stimulating the proliferation of mammalian cells. Our results offer a comprehensive method for utilising the abalone viscera, which is usually discarded as waste. © 2014 .",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.01.032,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897398203

Open and semi-closed circuits in the marine water zones in the north and south of Chile are the preferred areas of culture. Coastal ecosystems are subjected to a wide variety of contaminants that generate stress that affects populations via their impacts to individuals at both physiological and genetic levels. This work investigated the genomic and cellular response of post-weaning juvenile Haliotis rufescens abalone under hatchery conditions, fed with probiotic diets, and subsequently challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The expression patterns of 16 selected genes associated with different metabolic pathways were analyzed using Real-Time PCR. Gene expression was then compared to immunological response parameters in the abalone and quantification of V. parahaemolyticus during the experimental period. Both transcriptomic and immunological analyses indicated significant alteration of physiological processes in H. rufescens correlated to exposure to the pathogenic bacteria, as well as to probiotic nutrition. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.jip.2013.03.004,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875926099
Mulvaney W.J.; Winberg P.C.; Adams L.,Comparison of macroalgal (Ulva and Grateloupia spp.) and formulated terrestrial feed on the growth and condition of juvenile abalone,2013,Journal of Applied Phycology,25,3,815,824,,"The culture of abalone is a growth industry in Australia that primarily utilises terrestrial crops to produce formulated pellet feeds. The use of cultivated macroalgae in place of such feeds could provide for better environmental, nutritional and/or economic outcomes for this industry. However, direct comparison trials using macroalgae and formulated crop feeds are rare, and it is therefore difficult to ascertain the benefits and costs of each feed type. This study compares the benefits to growth and performance of the cultivated hybrid abalone cross (Haliotis rubra 1814 Leach and Haliotis laevigata 1808 Donovan) which was fed one of eight dietary treatments, including two commercially formulated pellet feeds and six mixed macroalgae dietary treatments. Macroalgae dietary treatments comprised the three macroalgae species Grateloupia turuturu Yamada, Ulva australis Areschoug and/or Ulva laetevirens Areschoug. Four replicate tubs, each containing 40 juvenile abalone (10-15 mm), were used to test each dietary treatment over a 12-week period. Macroalgae dietary treatments provided for significantly higher specific growth rates of abalone compared to formulated feeds, by orders of magnitude, for both length (>0.2 % compared to <0.1 % day-1, F 7, 31 = 22.3, p < 0.0001) and weight (from <0.4 to >0.8 % day-1, F 7, 31 = 24.4, p < 0.0001). In addition, abalone health and condition increased, and the proximate composition of abalone tissue had a higher carbohydrate/protein ratio, higher ash content and lower lipid content. These findings suggest that the juvenile abalone may benefit from macroalgae diets in comparison to two formulated feeds as a result of optimal proximate composition of the algae biomass and improved condition of the abalone. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",10.1007/s10811-013-9998-2,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877626339

Lau C.C.; Abdullah N.; Shuib A.S.,"Novel angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides derived from an edible mushroom, Pleurotus cystidiosus O.K. Miller identified by LC-MS/MS",2013,BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine,13,,,,313,"Background: Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been reported to reduce mortality in patients with hypertension. Compared to chemosynthetic drugs, ACE inhibitors derived from natural sources such as food proteins are believed to be safer for consumption and to have fewer adverse effects. Some edible mushrooms have been reported to significantly reduce blood pressure after oral administration. In addition, mushrooms are known to be rich in protein content. This makes them a potential source of ACE inhibitory peptides. Hence, the objective of the current study was to isolate and characterise ACE inhibitory peptides from an edible mushroom, Pleurotus cystidiosus.Methods: ACE inhibitory proteins were isolated from P. cystidiosus based on the bioassay guided purification steps, i.e. ammonium sulphate precipitation, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. Active fraction was then analysed by LC-MS/MS and potential ACE inhibitory peptides identified were chemically synthesized. Effect of in vitro gastrointestinal digestions on the ACE inhibitory activity of the peptides and their inhibition patterns were evaluated.Results: Two potential ACE inhibitory peptides, AHEPVK and GPSMR were identified from P. cystidiosus with molecular masses of 679.53 and 546.36 Da, respectively. Both peptides exhibited potentially high ACE inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 62.8 and 277.5 μM, respectively. SEC chromatograms and BIOPEP analysis of these peptides revealed that the peptide sequence of the hexapeptide, AHEPVK, was stable throughout gastrointestinal digestion. The pentapeptide, GPSMR, was hydrolysed after digestion and it was predicted to release a dipeptide ACE inhibitor, GP, from its precursor. The Lineweaver-Burk plot of AHEPVK showed that this potent and stable ACE inhibitor has a competitive inhibitory effect against ACE.Conclusion: The present study indicated that the peptides from P. cystidiosus could be potential ACE inhibitors. Although these peptides had lower ACE inhibitory activity compared to commercial antihypertensive drugs, they are derived from mushroom which could be easily obtained and should have no side effects. Further in vivo studies can be carried out to reveal the clear mechanism of ACE inhibition by these peptides. © 2013 Lau et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1472-6882-13-313,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887331709

Changing the percentage dietary protein from 33% to 26% reduced the concentration of FAN (F42, 252 = 2.79; P < 0.0001) in a serial-pass system and did not reduce weight gain (F1, 12 = 1.09; P = 0.31) or length gain (F1, 12 = 1.08; P = 0.31). Low water pH was the most important variable to contribute to a reduction in abalone growth (weight gain: F1, 19 = 64.5; P < 0.0001; r2 = 0.76; length gain: F1, 19 = 41.9; P < 0.0001; r2 = 0.67). In addition, supplemental oxygen (103% saturation) improved length gain (t = 3.45, P = 0.026) in abalone exposed to an average FAN concentration of 2.43 ± 1.1 μg L-1) and an average pH value of 7.6 ± 0.13, relative to a treatment with no oxygen supplementation. Thus, in an abalone serial-use raceway with three passes, FAN was not the first growth-limiting variable. It is suggested that future studies should examine the major causes of reduced water pH in serial-use systems and their effect on the growth and health of H. midae. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",10.1111/j.1365-2109.2012.03217.x,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892438149
O'Mahoney M.; Rice O.; Mouzakitis G.; Burnell G.,"Towards sustainable feeds for abalone culture: Evaluating the use of mixed species seaweed meal in formulated feeds for the Japanese abalone, Haliotis discus hannai",2014,Aquaculture,430,,9,16,,"Given the growing importance of the aquaculture sector in contributing to global seafood production, there needs to be a concerted effort to develop commercially relevant and ecologically sustainable feeds for the cultivation of commercially important species. Limitations on the availability and use of fish meal through EU directives (EC Regulation 999/2001 & EC Regulation 183/2005) are focussing research efforts to find alternative sources of protein for aquaculture feeds. Marine algae, although low in protein, are widely being considered as a potential alternative to fish meal as not only do they have the potential to impart additional health benefits when ingested but they can also be cultured under enrichment conditions to enhance their nutritional profile as a feed additive. For abalone (a marine gastropod mollusc), several studies have highlighted the benefits of a diet of fresh mixed species seaweed for cultivation. However, the performance of a mixed species marine algae meal, consisting of Laminaria digitata meal, Palmaria palmata meal and Ulva lactuca meal, in a formulated diet for abalone has not apparently been investigated. In this study, the performance of five novel, isonitrogenous, konjac glucomannan-xanthan gum (KX) bound feeds for the abalone Haliotis discus hannai were evaluated in a 12-week experimental growth trial. Comparisons were made between a basal diet formulation (Diet A), a basal diet. +. lipids. +. choline chloride (Diet B) and diets containing mixed seaweed meal (Diet C) or fish meal (Diet D) or mixed seaweed meal. +. fish meal (Diet E). Freshly harvested L. digitata was included as a natural feed type and experimental control. Dry matter leaching was assessed and no significant differences in the dry matter loss over 3 and 4. days were observed between the experimental KX feeds, although L. digitata was a significantly more seawater stable feed type. Daily food consumption (DFC) of Diet C and Diet E was significantly lower than that of fresh L. digitata and the DFC of Diet D was significantly higher than that of L. digitata. Diet E had significantly higher food conversion efficiency than L. digitata, Diet A, Diet B and Diet D. There was no difference in the protein efficiency ratio (PER) between the formulated diets but the PER of Diet D was significantly different to L. digitata. L. digitata had significantly higher linear growth rates than Diet B, and significant differences in the specific growth rates were observed between Diet A and Diet D only. No significant differences in body weight to shell length ratios and percentage survival between treatments were observed. This study highlights the potential for a mixed species seaweed meal as a fish meal replacement in formulated feeds for abalone. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.02.036,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898909767

Abalone artificial diets generally include fishmeal, limiting their utilization in ecologically sustainable aquaculture and affecting abalone quality and acceptance by the consumers. A six month feeding trial was conducted to assess the nutritional value of four different dried seaweed meals: Ulva lactuca (Chlorophyta), Gracilaria cornea (Rhodophyta), Laminaria digitata (Phaeophyta) and Palmaria palmata (Rhodophyta), as ingredients to all-vegetable-based formulated feeds for abalone Haliotis tuberculata coccinea (33.1. ±. 0.8. mm and 4.7. ±. 0.6. g). A mixed fresh algae diet of G. cornea and U. Ulva rigida, reared in an Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) system, served as control. Survival rates were very high (95-98%), regardless of the diet fed. Enriched fresh algae produced a significantly higher growth for H. tuberculata coccinea (169% weight gain) than all the artificial diets (49-84% WG). Comparison among abalone fed the different formulated diets showed that the inclusion of P. palmata improved growth, condition index and dietary protein utilization. On the contrary, the use of L. digitata markedly reduced the efficiency of dietary protein since the protein-related nutritional index (PER), the percentage of protein deposited in the foot muscle as well as the meat to shell ratio recorded for animals fed this diet were the lowest, despite a higher feed intake. Large differences were found in the FA profile of fresh algae as compared with the three formulated diets. The n-3/n-6 ratio was much higher in the fresh algae and, consequently, in the foot tissues of abalone fed this diet in comparison to the one of those fed the formulated ones. The elevated contents of 20:4n-6 in the abalone fed the experimental diets and 20:5n-3 in abalone fed the fresh algae, as well as their respective metabolites, suggest that abalone have the ability to desaturate and elongate LA to ARA and ALA to EPA. Further studies are required to improve the growth obtained with these vegetable based diets, especially concerning the use of different seaweed combinations and inclusion levels, as well as the diet processing methods to improve diet water stability. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.05.031,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84934948490

The immune and inflammatory responses of invertebrate clade B SERPINs have not been widely reported. In the present study, three proteins with high similarity to clade B SERPINs, referred to as AbSERPIN-1, AbSERPIN-2 and AbSERPIN-3, were identified from disk abalone (. Haliotis discus discus). While AbSERPIN-1 (399 aa) was of a typical size for this protein class, AbSERPIN-2 (506 aa) and AbSERPIN-3 (532 aa) were relatively larger. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the characteristic SERPIN domain in each AbSERPIN. In addition, the N-terminal region of both AbSERPIN-2 and AbSERPIN-3 contained a predicted low complexity region (LCR) and a signal peptide, suggesting that these proteins are secretory proteins and are, thus, novel peptides. Tertiary structural models of the AbSERPINs highlighted their structural and functional conservation. Ubiquitous expression of AbSERPIN transcripts was evaluated by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) analysis in seven tissue types. AbSERPIN-1, AbSERPIN-2, and AbSERPIN-3 transcript levels were highest in mantle, hemocytes, and muscles, respectively. Temporal expression analysis revealed that AbSERPINs were significantly (. P<0.05) elevated in hemocytes during the early/middle stages following the injection of a bacterial pathogen (. Vibrio parahaemolyticus or Listeria monocytogenes) or an immuno-stimulant (lipopolysaccharide). Moreover, mantle tissue injury led to significant changes in the temporal expression of AbSERPIN mRNA. Specifically, transcription of AbSERPIN-1 and AbSERPIN-3 was considerably up-regulated, while expression of AbSERPIN-2 was suppressed. These results suggest a potential role of AbSERPINs in response to pathogen invasion and tissue injury in disk abalone. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.fsi.2015.04.020,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929580377
Potter P.,An overview of the indigenous and alien allergens of Southern Africa,2013,Current Allergy and Clinical Immunology,26,4,182,189,,"Since the allergens causing clinical disease in Southern Africa were first identified in 1956 there has been a steady rise in the prevalence of allergic diseases in all populations. Although initial allergens were found to represent alien or introduced species, e.g. Bermuda grass, maize, lucerne, it later became apparent that indigenous allergens were also allergenic. Other major alien allergens which were imported into our region include oak, plane, pine and eucalyptus trees, the American, German and Oriental cockroaches, and fruits, e.g. kiwi and olive. The first truly African indigenous pollen allergen to be characterised was kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum) followed by buffalo grass (Stenotaphrum secundatum).

Several indigenous food sources are suspected to be causing food allergies in Botswana and are currently being investigated for allergenicity. In addition to the indigenous allergens described in this overview, South African researchers have also contributed to investigating and understanding the immunogenicity of other 'global allergens' such as Imbuia wood, verbena hybrida and Anisakis.

Both Cu and Zn were effectively accumulated by the abalones from water or macroalgae, but their concentration factors and trophic transfer factors were low due to the regulation of Cu and Zn accumulation. Following waterborne or dietary exposure, the abalones exhibited different accumulation patterns of Cu and Zn. The tissue Zn burden decreased quickly after the initial accumulation, and the incoming Zn was mainly deposited in the viscera. In contrast, the tissue Cu burden increased rapidly and gradually reached a steady state. The abalone muscle exhibited a comparable storage capacity of Cu as the viscera and the accumulated Cu in muscle was mainly derived from the dissolved phase instead of trophic transfer. The feeding and growth of the abalone were not influenced in all the exposure regimes. Moreover, the significant induction of metallothionein indicated that the bioaccumulated metals were actively detoxified. In the metal-exposed abalones, more Cu was distributed into the biologically detoxified fractions (metallothionein-like protein and/or metal-rich granule), whereas no significant subcellular redistribution of Zn was observed. Our study suggested that the abalone may have high endurance to the contamination of Cuor Zn. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.01.002,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875248568

Gonad precocity may affect the aquaculture of small abalone. Polyamines, which are small cationic molecules essential for cellular proliferation, may affect gonadal development. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and antizyme (AZ) are essential elements of a feedback circuit that regulates cellular polyamines. This paper presents the molecular cloning and characterization of AZ from small abalone. Sequence analysis showed that the cDNA sequence of H. diversicolor AZ (HdiODCAZ) consisted of two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) and conformed to the +1 frameshift property of the frame. Thin Layer chromatography (TLC) analysis suggested that the expressed protein encoded by +1 ORF2 was the functional AZ that targets ODC to 26S proteasome degradation. The result demonstrated that the expression level of AZ was higher than that of ODC in the ovary of small abalone. In addition, the expression profiles of ODC and AZ at the different development stages of the ovary indicated that these two genes might be involved in the gonadal development of small abalone. © 2015 Li et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0135251,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84943339978

About 53,300 progeny representing 533 full-sib families from the mating between 308 sires and 533 dams were tested in concrete tanks for five generations. Breeding candidates in the base generation (G0) and first generation (G1) were selected based on their estimated breeding values for growth (recorded as shell length at tagging and harvest), while those in later generations (G2-G3) were selected according to a selection index including individual breeding values for growth and family breeding values for survival traits. Variance components and genetic parameters were estimated using animal models and the restricted maximum-likelihood method. The breeding values of all animals over five generations were estimated using the best linear unbiased prediction. Within generations, the heritability estimates for square root transformed tagging shell length and harvest shell length were moderate, ranging from 0.125 to 0.237 and from 0.196 to 0.308, respectively. Across generations, the heritability estimates for the two growth traits were relatively low; 0.109 and 0.169, respectively, and the heritability of survival was low (0.069), but suggestive of a significant additive genetic component. Including all data, the effects common to full-sibs other than additive genetic effects (c2) accounted for 5.1%, 2.6% and 3.1% of the total phenotypic variance for transformed tagging shell length, harvest shell length and survival traits, respectively, and the three values were significantly different from zero (P<0.05). Genetic correlations of harvest shell length with tagging shell length and survival were favorable and significantly different from zero; 0.633 and 0.467, respectively. The predicted response was obtained from the difference in the mean breeding values between generations. When using the LS mean of the base population (G0) as a baseline for comparison, the average selection response of harvest shell length expressed as proportions ranged from 6.1% to 12.6%, with an average of 9.2%. The average estimated selection response per population for survival was 4.1%, and the accumulated selection response was 16.5% after performing four generations of selection. Based on these results, the breeding population had considerable additive genetic variation in growth traits, and the ongoing selective breeding program resulted in considerable genetic improvement in growth and survival in H. diversicolor. © 2014.

Experiments were performed at controlled water temperatures under optimal (Phase 1) and sub-optimal (Phase 2) temperatures. During Phase 1 the organic acid and organic acid salt blends significantly enhanced mass growth rate (both linear weight increase [AGRW] and specific growth rate [SGR]) compared to both controls. Linear length increase (AGRL) was significantly higher than the negative control. SGR was increased by 15.8%-17.9% relative to the negative control; AGRW and AGRL were between 12.9%-22.9% and 11.7%-13.5% higher, respectively. No significant growth enhancement was observed during Phase 2. Avilamycin had no effect on growth and none of the treatments had significant effects on feed conversion ratio (FCR), relative incidence cost (RIC, relative to negative control) or feed intake during either phase. The mode of growth enhancement could not be established; it could not be shown that the acid and salt treatments or the AGP had any effects on intestinal microflora, but possible energy effects of the acids were eliminated as potential mechanism; it is unclear what role gut acidification played in the enhanced growth performance. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.09.019,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80055003438

Proteinase inhibitors play a key role in regulating the activity of the respective proteinases. Among serine proteinase inhibitors, kazal-type proteinase inhibitors (KPIs) are widely found in mammals, avians, and a variety of invertebrates. In this study, we describe the identification of a kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor (Ab-KPI) from the disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus, which is presumably involved in innate immunity. The full-length cDNA of Ab-KPI includes 600bp nucleotides with an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 143 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of Ab-KPI contains a putative 17-amino acid signal peptide and two tandem kazal domains with high similarity to other kazal-type SPIs. Each kazal domain consists of reactive site (P1) residue containing a leucine (L), and a threonine (T) located in the second amino acid position after the second conserved cysteine of each domain. Temporal expression of Ab-KPI was assessed by real time quantitative PCR in hemocytes and mantle tissue following bacterial and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) challenge, and tissue injury. At 6hpost-bacterial and -VHSV challenge, Ab-KPI expression in hemocytes was increased 14-fold and 4-fold, respectively, compared to control samples. The highest up-regulations upon tissue injury were shown at 9h and 12h in hemocytes and mantle, respectively. The transcriptional modulation of Ab-KPI following bacterial and viral challenges and tissue injury indicates that it might be involved in immune defense as well as wound healing process in abalone. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.fsi.2013.07.005,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882841913

The bacteria were Gramnegative, rod-shaped and motile by means of more than one polar flagellum, oxidase-positive, catalase-positive and able to grow in the presence of 0.5-8.0% NaCl (optimum 3.0-6.0 %) and at 10-37 °C (optimum 25-30 °C). On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) using five loci (2443 bp; gyrB, pyrH, ftsZ, mreB and gapA), the closest phylogenetic neighbours of strain TCFB 0772T were the type strains of Vibrio communis (99.8 and 94.6% similarity, respectively), Vibrio owensii (99.8 and 94.1 %), Vibrio natriegens (99.4 and 88.8 %), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (99.4 and 90.3 %), Vibrio rotiferianus (99.2 and 94.4 %), Vibrio alginolyticus (99.1 and 89.3 %) and Vibrio campbellii (99.1 and 92.3 %). DNA-DNA hybridization confirmed that the six isolates constitute a unique taxon that is distinct from other known species of Vibrio. In addition, this taxon can be readily differentiated phenotypically from other Vibrio species. The six isolates therefore represent a novel species, for which the name Vibrio jasicida sp. nov. is proposed; the novel species is represented by the type strain TCFB 0772T (=JCM 16453T =LMG 25398T) (DNA G+C content 45.9 mol%) and reference strains TCFB 1977 (=JCM 16454) and TCFB 1000 (=JCM 16455). © 2012 IUMS.",10.1099/ijs.0.025916-0,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857790651

Gastropod molluscs have proved to be particularly useful foci for such studies, but the developmental expression of FaRPs and the evolution of specific transcripts for different peptides are unclear within the molluscs. Here we show that FaRPs are encoded by two transcripts that appear to be splice variants of a single gene in the abalone, Haliotis asinina, which represents the basal vetigastropods. Has-FMRF1 comprises 1,438 nucleotides and encodes a precursor protein of 329 amino acids that can potentially produce two copies of FLRFamide, one copy each of TLAGDSFLRFamide, QFYRIamide, SDPDLDDVIRASLLAYSLDDSPNN, and SVATAPVEAKAVEAGNKDIE, and 13 copies of FMRFamide. The second 1,241-nucleotide transcript, Has-FMRF2, encodes a 206-amino acid precursor protein with single copies of FLRFamide and FMRFamide along with such extended forms as NFGEPFLRFamide, FDSYEDKALRFamide, and NGWLHFamide, in addition to SDPGEDMLKSILLRGAPSNNGLQY and DTUDETTUNDNAHSRQ. Both transcripts are present early in life and are expressed in different but overlapping patterns within the developing larval nervous system. Mass spectrometry and immunocytochemistry demonstrate that FaRPs are cleaved from larger precursors and localize to the developing nervous system. Our results confirm previous evidence that FaRPs are expressed early and potentially play many roles during molluscan development and suggest that the last common ancestor to living gastropods used alternative splicing of an FMRFamide gene to generate a diversity of FaRPs in spatially restricted patterns in the nervous system. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",10.1002/cne.22621,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956272416

It is suspected that supplementation of wild populations with hatchery-reared abalone will be necessary for the recovery of this species. This study examines the magnitude, timing, and causes of post-outplanting mortality of hatchery-reared late-juvenile northern abalone. Abalone survivorship declined precipitously following outplanting, with 83% of abalone surviving 24 h after release and only 34% surviving 2 weeks in the wild. Handling, tagging, and temperature variations experienced during the outplanting procedure did not cause mortality. The majority of the abalone mortality in this study was attributable to predators. Additional factors accounted for only 1-2% mortality over 7 d. A 1-week acclimatization period within predator exclosures did not improve subsequent survival of outplants. These results demonstrate that the ouplanting of hatchery-reared abalone as a method of restoring wild populations of this endangered species is primarily constrained by high mortality during the first few days after outplanting, and that almost all of this early mortality is caused by predation. Predation mortality will therefore have to be overcome if outplanting of hatchery-reared juvenile abalone is to be an effective restoration strategy. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",10.1002/aqc.2315,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876411206

In this study, survival rates of the abalone, Haliotis diversicolor supertexta, against Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and its non-specific immune parameters such as the total haemocyte count (THC), phenoloxidase (PO) activity, respiratory bursts, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, phagocytic activity, and clearance efficiency to V. parahaemolyticus by H. diversicolor supertexta were determined when abalone (4.5 ± 0.4 g) were fed diets containing sodium alginate at 0, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 g kg-1. Abalone fed a diet containing sodium alginate at 2.0 and 3.0 g kg-1 for 14 days and at 1.0 g kg-1 for 21 days had significantly higher survival rates than those fed the control diet after challenge with V. parahaemolyticus. The relative survival percentages of abalone fed the 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 g kg-1 sodium alginate-containing diets for 14 and 21 days were 16.1%, 40.0%, and 48.0%, and 63.6%, 27.3% and 22.6%, respectively. The PO activity, respiratory bursts, SOD activity, and phagocytic activity and clearance efficiency of V. parahaemolyticus of abalone fed the sodium alginate-containing diets at 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 g kg-1 were significantly higher than those of abalone fed the control diet for 14 days. After 21 days, the PO activity, respiratory bursts, SOD activity, and phagocytic activity and clearance efficiency of V. parahaemolyticus by abalone fed the sodium alginate-containing diet at 1.0 g kg-1 were significantly higher than those of abalone fed the other diets. It was concluded that sodium alginate can be used as an immunostimulant for abalone through dietary administration to enhance immune responses of abalone and resistance against V. parahaemolyticus, which were related to the dose and timing of administration.

To determine stability at different temperatures, the virus was held at 4, 15, or 25 °C for 1, 5, and 12. days prior to immersion challenge of naïve abalone. Mortality curves indicated that when held for 1. day in sea water at 4 °C and 15 °C the virus remained infectious and highly pathogenic. In addition, the virus retained partial infectivity after 5. days held at 4 °C. Histological examination of abalone tissues following viral exposure confirmed the presence of lesions typical of abalone viral ganglioneuritis in animals showing morbidity signs. An additional experiment was performed to determine the virucidal efficacy of three disinfectants (calcium hypochlorite, Buffodine and the non-ionic surfactant Impress). The disinfectants were used at various doses and durations to treat AbHV prior to injection and immersion challenges. Results showed that Buffodine and the non-ionic surfactant Impress were effective at inactivating the virus with no detectable adverse effects on the abalone's health. In addition, calcium hypochlorite showed a virucidal effect when used on lower titres of virus prior to immersion challenge. © 2011 .",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.11.031,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84655162032

Ten diets were tested on 600 hatchery reared urchins (mean start weight = 0.11 g) for 6 mo with three replicate groups per diet. Nine of the diets were prepared specifically for urchins and varied in protein (16-40% protein) and carbohydrate (29-49% carbohydrate) levels. The other two diets consisted of a commercially available abalone diet and the kelp, Saccharina latissima. Weight measurements were carried out at 6-wk intervals, and at the end of the study urchins were individually weighed and a subsample from each treatment was analyzed for gonad weight and color. End weights after 6 mo ranged from 2.56 g for urchins fed the abalone diet to 6.11 g for urchins fed one of the prepared diets. Most of the prepared feeds outperformed kelp, and significant differences in growth were detected between some of the diets. In general, diets with lower protein levels (16-22% protein) and higher carbohydrate levels (>40% carbohydrate) produced the fastest growth. However, further diet refinement and/or use of finishing diets may be necessary to optimize gonad quality. © by the World Aquaculture Society 2012.",10.1111/j.1749-7345.2012.00560.x,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859339553

As monitoring progresses and restoration efforts evolve to include population supplementation, a reliable and robust method of tagging individual abalone is needed. Current abalone tagging methods are unsatisfactory, particularly for long-term studies as a result of tag loss, shell erosion, and encrustation. Observing tag numbers of cryptically positioned abalone can be difficult. To obviate these issues, we evaluated passive integrated transponders (PITs) as tags for pinto abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana kamtschatkana). We applied 9-mm PITs with cyanoacrylate glue to the dorsal exterior of the shell and to the ventral anterior of the shell, and by injection into the foot muscle of small adults (trial 1), and applied PITs to the ventral anterior of the shell of juveniles (trial 2). We subsequently tracked growth, survival, and tag retention over 15 mo in trial 1 and 6 mo in trial 2 in captivity. Among small adults (trial 1), differences in relative growth rate and survival were not significant. PIT retention by adhesion to the ventral anterior and dorsal exterior was significantly greater than injection into the foot in trial 1. Between controls and tagged animals in trial 2, differences in survival were not significant. There was no significant difference in ventral anterior tag retention between trial 1 and trial 2. Gluing PITs on the ventral anterior of the shell is a promising method because abalone quickly formed nacre over the tags, incorporating them into the shell, which does not appear to affect tag detection by the PIT reader. Trials are underway to characterize PIT retention in natural habitats, to determine tag longevity, and to use PITs to track adults reintroduced to aggregations.",10.2983/035.031.0324,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866646439

The control diet contained 1.5% FO supplement (0% CO). Four other diets contained FO/CO in ratios of 3:1 (CO 25%), 1:1 (CO 50%), 1:3 (CO 75%) and 100% CO. The result demonstrated that abalone fed the diets supplemented with 25% and 50% CO showed similarly high levels of total omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) (P < 0.05) as the 0% CO group. The highest levels of total PUFA and total monounsaturated fatty acids were found in the 100% CO group (P < 0.05). The results also showed that Δ-6 desaturase and elongase 2 gene expression was increased in a graded manner by increasing dietary CO (P < 0.05).

Dyck M.; Roberts R.; Jeffs A.,"Assessing alternative grazing-tolerant algae for nursery culture of abalone, Haliotis iris",2011,Aquaculture,320,1-Feb,62,68,,"Feeding during the nursery stage of abalone aquaculture, from larval settlement to 10. mm in shell length (SL), is a major challenge in the intensification of abalone aquaculture. Commercial abalone nurseries typically settle larvae onto vertical plastic plates coated with algae that act as a settlement cue and an important post-settlement food source. It becomes increasingly difficult to maintain an adequate algal food supply as the abalones grow and for this purpose many nurseries use the alga, Ulvella lens, as it is a very effective settlement cue as well as offering a resilient food source for the developing abalones. However, juvenile abalones can deplete a film of diatoms on the plates before they are capable of ingesting U. lens, and once abalone reach ~. 5. mm SL the high grazing pressure may exceed even what U. lens can support, requiring nurseries to provide additional cultured algae or prematurely wean the juveniles onto manufactured diets. Three prospective microfilamentous algal species isolated from the tanks of a commercial abalone facility, were selected as potentially suitable nursery algae as they demonstrated resistance to intensive juvenile grazing pressure, displayed rapid vegetative growth, and could be triggered to mass sporulate as a means of rapidly coating nursery tanks. The current study involved two experiments and assessed the suitability of each species as a live algal feed for juvenile abalones compared to U. lens. These experiments measured: (1) ingestibility and grazing resistance of each alga against juvenile abalone 1-8. mm SL, and (2) the ability of each species to recover once grazers had been removed. Two algae (Ulvophyceae sp. 1 and 3) demonstrated the desirable properties of being easily grazed by abalones of a smaller size (average SL 2.33. mm and 2.20. mm respectively) than U. lens (2.89. mm) yet provide an algal film that is likely to be resilient and durable under grazing pressure. These algae also displayed significantly greater rates of recovery following grazing than U. lens (p < 0.01), an important attribute for restoring algal films in nursery systems between grazing events or between batches of juvenile abalones. The results of this study indicate that these novel algae have a combination of desirable characteristics for use in commercial abalone nurseries. Further experiments in commercial scale nursery systems should be pursued to assess the food value and performance of these species as a feed for juvenile abalones. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.07.033,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052910087

This study examines the effect of macroalgae Ulva lactuca and Spyridia filamentosa, cyanobacteria Arthrospira maxima, and microalgae Dunaliella salina on the growth and immunity of Haliotis laevigata, in comparison to a commercially formulated pellet. Over 12 weeks, U. lactuca or S. filamentosa produced the lowest growth rate, indicating lack of nutrients for abalone growth in a single macroalgae diet. Pellets supplemented with 10% A. maxima or D. salina resulted in increased abalone shell length (13.3 and 30.7%, respectively) and body weight (19.9 and 33.4%) over the pellet control diet. The impact of algal supplementation on hemolymph immunity was mainly represented by a drop in total hemocyte counts (THC) and some diet specific effects on superoxide anion and antibacterial activity against Vibrio anguillarum. No effect of diet was observed on phagocytosis, phenoloxidase, or antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1. It is conceived that the humoral antimicrobial factors in abalone hemolymph are innately biosynthesized rather than dietary derived compounds. Nevertheless, concomitant with strong antiviral activity against HSV-1 in a lipophilic extract of U. lactuca and S. filamentosa, higher antiviral activity was detected in the digestive lipid extract of abalone fed U. lactuca (64.2% at 650 μg ml-1) or S. filamentosa (69.51%) compared to abalone fed pellets (47.42%) or pellets supplemented with A. maxima (46.3%) or D. salina (46%). This suggests that abalone may also derive some protection against oral pathogens by algal derived bioactive compounds. These results indicate that abalone growth rate could be optimized by A. maxima and D. salina supplementations, whereas U. lactuca and S. filamentosa could be useful supplements for abalone aquaculture, especially in areas with high risk of herpesvirus infection. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.08.009,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052889827

Abalone are well known for exhibiting spatial heterogeneity in their biological properties. Each population in the simulation was represented by a size-based population dynamics model and had biological properties of growth, maturation, emergence from crypsis, and mortality specific to each population; the range of these properties varies to different degrees in the different quota zones around Tasmania. The simulation was used to compare the effects of applying different legal minimum length (LML) regulations on the fishery. Because of spatial heterogeneity in growth, a single LML within a zone has always been a compromise between underprotecting some populations and overprotecting others. The simulation was used to determine the protection afforded the overall mature biomass and the variation likely among different populations, and how these populations then responded to exploitation. In addition, when setting an LML within a zone, an analysis was made, using the simulation, of the potential trade-offs between the total allowable catch (TAC), the number of abalone needed to take that TAC, the proportion of the mature biomass protected by the LML, and the stock depletion level after fishing with different LMLs but the same TAG.",10.2983/035.032.0126,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877273699
Whitaker A.R.; Byrd B.F.,Boat-based foraging and discontinuous prehistoric red abalone exploitation along the California coast,2012,Journal of Anthropological Archaeology,31,2,196,214,,"Temporally and spatially discontinuous pulses of heavy prehistoric exploitation of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) have been documented along the southern and central California coast. This article examines the very late (post-950. cal BP) appearance of numerous red abalone processing sites on the Monterey Peninsula in central California. We test three prominent explanations offered for the sudden onset of red abalone processing sites: trophic cascades resulting from human predation on sea otters, logistical foraging by inland residents, and changes in sea surface temperature. A trophic cascade appears to have occurred but does not fully explain the nature or timing of the phenomenon in the region. We present an alternative explanation that argues that intensive procurement of red abalone emerged at a time when both population pressure and social complexity increased greatly in central California. We argue that a new exploitation strategy-diving from boats-was employed to exploit a much larger portion of the red abalone habitat. This strategy entailed logistical forays by divers who worked new patches in tandem with boaters, gathered large quantities in a single foray, and then field processed them in bulk on the shore before transporting the meat to coastal residences. This strategy provided an additional source of food, and both tradable dried meat and numerous large shells that could be manufactured into ornaments and traded as decorative accoutrements. We conclude our discussion with a consideration of the factors that created such a discontinuous record of red abalone exploitation along the California coast. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.jaa.2011.12.001,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857913452

The molecular mass of the deduced protein is approximately 25.37. kDa with an estimated pI of 5.00, and it shares highest 41% identity to IGFBP7 of . Amblyomma americanum. Analysis of conserved domains revealed the presence of an IGFBP N-terminal domain (IB), a kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor domain (KI), and an immunoglobulin-like C2 domain (IgC2) in saIGFBP7. Furthermore, the 12 cysteine residues and the signature amino acid motif 'xCGCCxxC' which are characterized by the amino terminus region of the IGFBP superfamily are all presented in saIGFBP7. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot were employed to investigate the tissue distribution of saIGFBP7, and its expression under bacterial challenge. The saIGFBP7 mRNA and protein could be detected in all examined tissues, with the highest expression level in hemocytes, higher expression level in gills, and was up-regulated in hemocytes and gills after bacterial injection. In addition, . saIGFBP7 mRNA transcripts were observed in a subset of the branchial epithelium and the nucleus of hemocytes using the . in situ hybridization method. Interestingly, saIGFBP7 was detected mainly in the goblet-like cell of the branchial epithelium by immunohistochemistry. These results suggested that saIGFBP7 was likely to be involved in a function associated with pathogenic infection and may play an important role in the adult abalone immune system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.fsi.2012.04.016,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863218517

Hannon C.; Officer R.A.; Le Dorven J.,Review of the technical challenges facing aquaculture of the European abalone Haliotis tuberculata in Ireland,2013,Aquaculture International,21,2,243,254,,"Insufficient supply of available market size abalone from the wild stocks has resulted in increasing efforts since the early 1990s to culture this valuable marine shellfish. Despite significant financial investment and the establishment and expansion of farms around Europe, the production of a saleable end product has remained undefined. The technical barriers to producing viable juvenile abalone spat still impair growth of the industry in Ireland. Critical developments required in the industry are identified. Uptake of these developments from research remains slow due to the trial-and-error approach taken by operators. Using technologies and procedures from producing countries and implementing them into Irish culture conditions will aid the development and expansion of the industry. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",10.1007/s10499-012-9584-7,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878277324
Heinemann F.; Gummich M.; Radmacher M.; Fritz M.,Modification of CaCO3 precipitation rates by water-soluble nacre proteins,2011,Materials Science and Engineering C,31,2,99,105,,"Mineral growth in nacre and other CaCO3-containing biominerals is controlled by biopolymers. Water-soluble proteins were extracted from nacre of the sea snail Haliotis laevigata by dissolving the mineral phase with 6% acetic acid. The influence of this protein mixture on CaCO3 precipitation rates was investigated at different concentrations. A well-established assay for measuring the pH-value during CaCO3 precipitation with and without protein additives was extended by calculating maximum precipitation rates from the pH-values. It could be shown that precipitation rates are greatly influenced by the mixtures of water-soluble nacre proteins. At very low protein concentrations (0.02 μg/ml) a rate enhancement in comparison to the pure supersaturated calcium carbonate solution by a factor of 1.4 was observed. At higher protein concentrations, a strong inhibitory effect occurred, with total inhibition at concentrations of 1.0 μg/ml and higher. Two unspecific proteins (bovine serum albumin and lysozyme) showed little or no modification of precipitation rates. In vivo, the function of the strong inhibition of CaCO3 precipitation by nacre proteins at higher concentrations is presumably to prevent uncontrolled crystallization in the extrapallial fluid. The rate-enhancing capability of proteins at low concentrations may be explained by the presence of acidic and/or hydrophilic moieties. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The study involved three growth experiments: (E1) diets containing 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5% of FO, respectively; (E2) diets in which FO was serially replaced by 25, 50, 75 and 100% FlaxO, respectively; and (E3) diets in which FO was serially replaced by 25, 50, 75 and 100% CO, respectively. Results: In Experiment 1, abalone fed a diet supplemented with 1.5% FO showed a significantly higher (121.2 ± 1.1 mg day-1) daily growth rate of weight (DGRw) compared to control (70.1 ± 1.71 mg day-1). In Experiment 2, abalone fed 1.5% FO diet and diets containing 25-75% FlaxO showed no significant differences in DGRw. The diet containing 100% FlaxO showed significantly lower (63.3 ± 6.7 mg day-1) DGRw. In Experiment 3, abalone fed diets containing 25% and 50% CO showed similar DGRw as those fed a 1.5% FO diet. The diet containing 75% and 100% CO showed significantly lower (63.7 ± 5.0 to 95.4 ± 5.1 mg day-1) DGRw. Conclusion: Supplementation with 1.5% of dietary FO can improve growth performance in cultured abalone. It is feasible to replace 75% of dietary FO with FlaxO and 50% of dietary FO with CO, without negative effect on growth performance. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.",10.1002/jsfa.5905,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875591849

This study was conducted to identify the microalgal species suitable for the growth of early larvae of H. discus hannai. The growth and attachment rates of 31 microalgal species were examined. Acrylic plates were used as the substrate. Among the 31 microalgal species, nine showing high growth and attachment rates were selected and tested for their dietary values via factors including settlement, metamorphosis, and survival rates of abalone larvae. Tetraselmis hazeni and Rhaphoneis sp. induced the highest settlement rate (65-69%) in abalone larvae. The metamorphosis rate was highest (57%) in larvae fed Rhaphoneis sp. and was also significantly higher in larvae fed Oscillatoria splendida (29%) and T. hazeni (22%) than in those fed other species. The highest survival rate of the larvae during the 15 days after metamorphosis was 67% in those fed Rhaphoneis sp., followed by T. hazeni (42%) and O. splendida (35%). In conclusion, Rhaphoneis sp. is the most suitable diatom for use as a live food for the culture of early larvae of H. discus hannai.

Seventy juvenile abalone averaging 4.7 g were randomly distributed into each of 18, 50-L plastic rectangular containers. Six containers were placed into each temperature condition of three 1.3 ton concrete flow-through raceway systems. Abalone were daily fed with either the formulated diet or dry sea tangle once a day to satiation level. Survival was affected by feed type, but not by temperature. Weight gain of abalone was affected by both feed type and temperature. Regardless of temperature, weight gain of abalone fed the formulated diet was better than that of abalone fed the dry sea tangle. Shell length and width were affected by feed type, but not by temperature. In conclusion, weight gain of abalone was affected by both feed type and temperature, but feed type had a stronger effect than temperature.

Shakouri B.; Yazdi S.K.,The sustainable marine aquaculture,2012,Advances in Environmental Biology,6,1,18,23,,"Aquaculture is the keeping, breeding, hatching or culturing of fish. Fish used for aquaculture include nonpearl oysters, mussels, yabbies, marron, crayfish, abalone, prawns, freshwater and marine finfish, trochus and algae for beta carotene (ie any marine organism other than reptiles, birds and mammals). Aquaculture has an important role in the development of many national economies and plays a key role in world development. As the expansion of aquaculture product, there is a growing concern over the impacts of aquaculture on the environmental sustainability and also over the requirements on quality and food safety by consumers and regulators. Global wild fisheries are in decline, with valuable habitat such as estuaries in critical condition. The aquaculture or farming of piscivorous fish, like salmon, does not help the problem because they need to eat products from other fish, such as fish meal and fish oil. Apart from fish and shrimp, some aquaculture undertakings, such as seaweed and filterfeeding bivalve mollusks like oysters, clams, mussels and scallops, are relatively benign and even environmentally restorative. Filter-feeders filter pollutants as well as nutrients from the water, improving water quality. Some profitable aquaculture cooperatives promote sustainable practices. New methods lessen the risk of biological and chemical pollution through minimizing fish stress, fallowing netpens, and applying Integrated Pest Management. Vaccines are being used more and more to reduce antibiotic use for disease control. Onshore recirculating aquaculture systems, facilities using polyculture techniques, and properly sited facilities (e.g. offshore areas with strong currents) are examples of ways to manage negative environmental effects. It is a need to improve aquaculture technology and management system to address the need for eco-friendly production process and food safety concerns in the sustainability of national aquaculture. Fisheries Management should be done for job opportunity, and for fisher, farmer and related community welfare, and also for fisheries resources and environmental sustainability. In addition, it is mentioned also that the product from both capture and aquaculture fisheries should meet quality standard and product safety.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857381895

Although some nutrition research has been done to identify the optimum dietary protein level, typically farms use only 1 diet for grow-out after the juveniles are weaned. Little consideration has been given to the effects of fluctuating water temperatures and dietary protein levels on the morphology of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of abalone. Because these factors are known to impact growth in other aquatic species, it is important that they are investigated further to improve growth in abalone species. In this study, the histological changes of the GIT of greenlip abalone in response to 2 water temperatures and 4 dietary levels of crude protein (juvenile, 27% and 36%; subadult, 24% and 33%) for juveniles (1.75 g) and subadults (22.93 g) were investigated. The epithelial thickness of the stomach and crop; intestinal villus height, width, and area; lamina propria height; and stomach, crop, and intestinal neutral and acidic goblet cell numbers were measured. The stomach epithelium was significantly thicker at 14°C than 22°C in both juveniles and subadults, whereas the crop epithelium was significantly thicker at 22°C than 14°C in juveniles. The crop epithelial thickness of subadults was reduced by increasing dietary protein; however, juveniles did not show the same response. Juvenile abalone were more sensitive to temperature fluctuations than subadults, whereas significant effects of dietary protein levels were only observed in subadults. The alterations in the morphology of the GIT did not appear to be detrimental to the health and growth of the abalone. Further research is required to investigate the interactive effects of water temperature and dietary ingredients, particularly in regard to antinutritional factors, on the morphology and function of the GIT to improve our understanding of abalone physiology.",10.2983/035.032.0119,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877249550

The growing industry has led to increased intensification. Farms are concentrated in certain areas, notably Hermanus on the South coast, and may be close to wild abalone populations and processing facilities. These factors contribute to increased risk of disease emergence. Data on parasite prevalence generated from the abalone health management program between 2000 and 2004 was analysed for trends. Abalone were sampled systematically from participating farms and subjected to gross and histological examination. Data on age, size, gonad development, diet and type of system were recorded. This paper presents the most significant results for gut protozoa, digestive gland protozoa and rickettsia like prokaryotes, which are all gut associated. Prevalence was found to increase with increasing age and size. Higher parasite prevalences were found on the West coast than on the South coast, and outside Hermanus compared to within Hermanus, suggesting that concentration of farms is not leading to increased prevalence. Gut associated parasites were significantly more prevalent in animals fed on kelp than artificial feed. It was found that animals younger than 24. months are more at risk of infection when fed kelp than older animals. The results indicate that separation of age groups, removal of poor performers and use of artificial feed, especially in younger animals, are likely to reduce risk of infection with gut associated parasites. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.01.003,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952069961

Three isoenergetic diets contained 33% (P33), 26% (P26), and 22% (P22) protein. Biomass of abalone was 7.6 ± 0.1 kg/300-L tank (45-55 g/abalone). TAN and FAN concentrations were significantly correlated with dietary protein (P) (P < 0.0001) and flow index (FI; as measured by liters per hour per kilogram; P < 0.0001), and could be estimated using the models TAN = 9.73 P - 110.3 log (FI), and FAN = 0.132 P - 1.10 log (FI). Mean FAN concentration in the P22 and P26 treatments was 67% and 41% lower, respectively, than in tanks fed the P33 diet. Because this species can grow well on low-protein diets, it is hypothesized that a reduction in percentage protein will improve the carrying capacity of serial-use systems.

Larval settlement was the highest on CCA (61 %) tailed by a 45-day-old mix of U. lens and U. rigida (52%) and 45-day-old U. rigida (46%). Settlement was the lowest (about 3%) on a mix of 4-day-old U. lens and U. rigida and 45-day-old enriched or unenriched U. lens. In all treatments, postlarvae were fed for 4 wk with a mix of diatoms (Amphora sp., Proschkinia sp., Nitzschia sp., and Navicula incerta); postlarval growth was the best on the 45-day-old mix of U. lens and U. rigida. This substrate was also the best of the green macroalgae germlings substrates tested for settlement induction and provided good survival rates. The substrate protein content correlated negatively with larval settlement and survival. The algal cues were differentiated by their fatty acid composition. Fatty acids such as 18:ln-7, 18:2n-6, 16:4n-3, arachidonic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid were suggested to affect settlement and survival. The fatty acids correlated with settlement were different from the ones associated with survival rates, except eicosapentaenoic acid, which correlated with both.

Larvae were settled on Ulvella lens and Ulva rigida germlings at a density of 0.5larvaecm2 of substrate. Growth and survival, in each dietary treatment, were monitored during ten weeks. Experimental nursery tanks were weekly inoculated with 2L of the different diatom inoculums (105-106cellsmL-1). Proximate biochemical compositions were significantly different for the four diatom species. Amphora sp. presented a significantly higher lipid and protein contents with 7.11±0.29% DW and 18.50±0.97% DW respectively, while Proschkinia sp. presented the lowest protein content and the highest ash content. The fatty acid profiles of the diatoms were variable but remained typical of the diatom family. Larvae contained significantly more lipids (25.30±0.93% DW) than juveniles. The different fatty acid compositions found for the various diatom species were dissimilar to the ones of larvae, juveniles and substrates; (Courtois de Viçose et al., in press-a) the fatty acid compositions of these last two not being different among treatments. 16:4n-3, 20:4n-6 (arachidonic acid, ARA) and 22:5n-3 (docosapentaenoic acid, DPA) were the most abundant fatty acids in juveniles while 20:5n-3 (ecosapentaenoic acid, EPA) was the dominant polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), present at a comparable level in all diatoms. This suggests that the post-larvae and juveniles are capable to absorb a selection of fatty acids from the food source or that they are able to synthesise them from precursor dietary fatty acids. Growth rates obtained in the present study are presenting different phases and diatom diets made little difference to growth rate of post-larvae until reaching around 0.8-1mmSL, after which divergence in growth rate among diets became significant. Post-larvae fed the diatom with the highest protein and lipid contents (Amphora sp.) showed the best daily growth rate (DGR) of 50±3μm over the feeding trial, highlighting the joint influence of diatoms' protein and lipid content on growth. Around 2mmSL, juveniles exhibited increased growth rates, in all treatments, reaching 94μmday-1, indicating a possible shift in nutrition towards green macroalgae germlings and suggesting that U. lens and U. rigida are used as a complement to the diatom diet at this stage. 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 found in high amount in all juveniles as well as in all substrates could be an indication of that nutritional shift and could be involved in growth enhancement. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.12.040,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857108990

The health indicators included survival, goblet cell counts, and epithelium thickness of the tentacle region. Proximate analyses and amino acid and fatty acid profiles were also determined on the diets, soft body tissues and shell materials to evaluate the nutrient contents (diet and animal) and requirements (animal). Measurements of soft body, gonad, and shell growth parameters indicated that white and red fishmeals generally result in better growth. Animals fed blood meal had the lowest survival rates and crude protein contents. Spirulina produced animals with the heaviest shells and soybean treatments produced animals with the highest gonad to soft body ratios. Significantly lower acid/basic amino acid ratios were found in fishmeal diets, indicating that animals fed fishmeal may incorporate more aragonite than calcite in their shells. © by the World Aquaculture Society 2012.",10.1111/j.1749-7345.2011.00545.x,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856432031

Those well characterized so far are waprins from snakes, perlwapins from bivalves and crustins from decapod crustaceans. Waprins are venom proteins with a single WAP domain at the C-terminus. They display antimicrobial, rather than proteinase inhibitory, activities. Perlwapins, in contrast, possess three WAP domains at the C-terminus and are expressed in the shell nacre of abalones. They participate in shell formation by inhibiting the growth of calcium crystals in the shell. The crustin group is the largest of all WFDC-containing proteins in invertebrates with the vast majority being highly expressed in the haemocytes. Most have a single WAP domain at the C-terminus. The presence and type of the domains between the signal sequence and the C-terminus WAP domain separate the different crustin types. Most of the Type I and II crustins are antimicrobial towards Gram-positive bacteria, whereas the Type III crustins tend to display protease inhibition. Expression studies show that at least some crustins have other important biological effects, as levels change with physiological stress, wound repair, tissue regeneration or ecdysis. Thus WAP domains are widely distributed and highly conserved, serving in diverse physiological processes (proteinase inhibition, bacterial killing or inhibition of calcium transport). ©The Authors Journal compilation ©2011 Biochemical Society.",10.1042/BST0391403,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053366469

Abalones were fed on macroalgae diets, Gracilaria cornea, with three different protein levels, Low-N, Medium-N, and High-N. After inducing spawning, a higher number of eggs released per gram of abalone and the greatest egg and cytoplasm diameters were found in abalones fed on Medium-N and High-N G. cornea diets. Feeding High-N G. cornea increased the level of arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6) in the mature gonad tissue in H. tuberculata coccinea. Likewise, a histological study on the gonadal morphology revealed that ripe-stage individuals fed on a Low-N G. cornea diet had a larger macrophage populations and the areas of degenerated oocytes increased. These results suggest that macroalgae cultivated in seawater enriched with ammonium may be a good choice for producing food for female H. tuberculata coccinea broodstock in the Canaries. © by the World Aquaculture Society 2012.",10.1111/j.1749-7345.2012.00617.x,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870790701
Rossetto M.; de Leo G.A.; Bevacqua D.; Micheli F.,Allometric scaling of mortality rates with body mass in abalones,2012,Oecologia,168,4,989,996,,"The existence of an allometric relationship between mortality rates and body mass has been theorized and extensively documented across taxa. Within species, however, the allometry between mortality rates and body mass has received substantially less attention and the consistency of such scaling patterns at the intra-specific level is controversial. We reviewed 73 experimental studies to examine the relationship between mortality rates and body size among seven species of abalone (Haliotis spp.), a marine herbivorous mollusk. Both in the field and in the laboratory, log-transformed mortality rates were negatively correlated with log-transformed individual body mass for all species considered, with allometric exponents remarkably similar among species. This regular pattern confirms previous findings that juvenile abalones suffer higher mortality rates than adult individuals. Field mortality rates were higher overall than those measured in the laboratory, and the relationship between mortality and body mass tended to be steeper in field than in laboratory conditions for all species considered. These results suggest that in the natural environment, additional mortality factors, especially linked to predation, could significantly contribute to mortality, particularly at small body sizes. On the other hand, the consistent allometry of mortality rates versus body mass in laboratory conditions suggests that other sources of mortality, beside predation, are size-dependent in abalone. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/s00442-011-2163-1,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858008350

This study was conducted in a recirculation facility in which four KX binder configurations were evaluated in a series of isonitrogenous experimental feeds and freshly harvested Laminaria digitata was included as a natural feed type. Dry matter leaching of the experimental feed treatments was assessed with no significant difference in the dry matter leaching between treatments observed. No differences (P>0.05) were found in percentage survival, daily food consumption (DFC) and linear growth rate (LGR) between treatments. Food conversion efficiency (FCE), specific growth rate (SGR) and body weight/shell length (BW/SL) ratio were significantly higher when offered L. digitata.

Five semipurified diets with 35gkg-1 total lipid were formulated to contain graded LA/EPA ratios (1:0, 0.75:0.25, 0.5:0.5, 0.25:0.75, and 0:1, respectively). Twenty-five juveniles were stocked in a rearing unit, a plastic basket (20× 20×10cm), as a replicate, and there were three replicates for each dietary treatment. The results showed that abalone survival rates were generally high (90.1-98.3%) and independent of the dietary treatments. However, abalone growth was significantly affected by LA/EPA ratio (P< 0.05). The LA/EPA ratio of 0.25:0.75 (Diet 4) produced the highest weight gain rate (WGR, 416.3%), closely followed by the ratio of 0:1 (Diet 5, 412.9%), the ratio of 0.5:0.5 (Diet 3, 399.7%) and the ratio of 0.75:0.25 (Diet 2, 372.1%), but no significant differences were observed among these treatments. The abalone fed the diet without 20:5n-3 (Diet 1) had the lowest WGR (Diet 1, 363.8%), which was significantly lower than that of Diet 4. Fatty acid profiles in abalone body reflected those of dietary lipids, especially for the polyunsaturated fatty acids. The contents of arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4n-6) in abalone tissues were positively correlated with dietary level of 18:2n-6 (P<0.05). Similar correlation was also observed between the level of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) in abalone tissues and the level of dietary EPA. It is suggested that abalone, H. discus hannai, have the capacity to synthesize 20:4n-6 from 18:2n-6, and maybe 22:6n-3 from 20:5n-3. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1365-2095.2010.00802.x,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953299513

Larvae were settled (1.5 μM gamma-aminobutyric acid) in 2-L plastic vessels (total area, 701 cm2) and were subjected to the following treatments: static conditions, static conditions with aeration (NF + A), flow opened after 10 d, flow opened after 17 d, and flow opened after 24 d. The experiment was conducted at constant temperature (17.5 ± 0.5°C) and light intensity (∼750 lux). Water was changed daily in static treatments, and flow treatments received filtered seawater at ∼60 mL/min. Postlarvae were fed the benthic diatom Navicula incerta per standardized protocols. Every week, all organisms in each experimental unit were counted to estimate survival, and samples of 15 postlarvae were recorded under an inverted microscope and measured using digital image analysis. At the end of the experiment, greater survival occurred in treatment NF + A (68.2%) and was the lowest in the treatment in which flow was opened after 10 days (26.9%); however, no significant differences were found (P > 0.37). The greatest growth rate was observed in the treatment in which flow was opened after 24 days (61.6 μm/d), and the lowest was seen in static conditions (47.6 μm/d and 44.6 μm/d for static conditions and NF + A treatments, respectively). An inverse relationship between final growth rates and postlarval densities was found.

Between 2002 and 2005, the Bamfield Huu-ay-aht Community Abalone Project released 4. 5 million larvae and 152,000 juveniles of the northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana) into Barkley Sound, BC. The purpose of this study was to estimate the long-term survival of outplanted abalone 3-7 years after their release and thus determine their contribution to local population densities at three different outplanting sites. We identified outplanted abalone by genotyping epipodal tentacles sampled from wild-caught abalone for seven microsatellite loci. We then used three different pedigree reconstruction programs: one that used genotypes from hatchery-reared siblings (PEDIGREE 2. 2), one that used the wild parent genotypes that were available (CERVUS 3. 0), and one that used both sources of information (COLONY 2. 0). Each program identified different but partially overlapping subsets of hatchery-outplanted offspring. From this we inferred that up to 26% of the individuals sampled at the main outplanting site were from hatchery spawnings. Despite this large contribution of hatchery-reared stock, the density of mature abalone at each site was below the level required for successful fertilization. More intensive outplanting efforts might increase population densities of this broadcast spawner above this minimum sustainable level. However, for supplementation to be successful, other factors that could reduce outplanted juvenile survival, including the low genetic diversity of hatchery-produced offspring and the low habitat quality of some outplanting sites, need to be monitored. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",10.1007/s10592-012-0330-5,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860473763

At multiple locations, we examined the hypothesis that diversity and abundance in temperate reef fish assemblages were independent of bait type. We used 3 bait types (abalone viscera, pilchards and crushed urchin) and quantified commonly used metrics for the fish assemblage, including species richness, time of first arrival and relative abundance on 3 shallow rocky reefs in southeastern Australia over 2 yr. We distinguished the following 6 feeding guilds: herbivore, zooplanktivore, alga/invertebrate consumers, invertebrate carnivore, macroinvertebrate carnivore and generalist carnivore. The response of fishes was dependent on bait type, with urchin bait performing particularly poorly. Although we did not detect statistical differences between the performance of pilchards and abalone viscera as bait, pilchards produced more consistent outcomes. Importantly, we also observed strong spatial effects. In general, bait type had a marked effect on species richness, but little influence on relative abundance. Overall we conclude that oily bait such as pilchards, which have been widely used in most studies, yield the most consistent outcomes. Consequently, bait type and spatial variation in fish assemblages needs to be considered in sampling designs to assess the limitations of BRUVS.

However, the health beneficial effects of abalone have rarely been reported. In the present study, we examine the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of abalone Haliotis discus hannai in macrophage cells. The results showed that abalone intestine digest (AID) has antioxidant activities against lipid peroxidation, ROS stress and DNA damage in H2O 2-treated RAW264.7 macrophages. In the lipopoly-saccharide (LPS)-induced macrophages, AID suppresses LPS-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in a dose-dependent manner. It also significantly reduced the generation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-6. Furthermore AID significantly suppresses the phosphorylation of mito-gen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as ERK, JNK, and p38. These results indicated that AID inhibits oxidative damage by ROS and LPS-induced inflammatory response via blocking the MAPK signaling pathway in murine macrophages.

The results showed that PAEs could significantly reduce embryo hatchability, increase developmental malformations, and suppress the metamorphosis of abalone larvae. The possible toxicological mechanisms of PAEs to abalone embryos included, affecting the Na+-K+-pump and Ca 2+-Mg2+-pump activities, altering the peroxidase (POD) level and the malondialdehyde (MDA) production, damaging the extraembryonic membranes structure, as well as disrupting endocrine-related genes (gpx, cyp3a, and 17β-hsd 12) expression properties. Taken together, this work showed that PAEs adversely affected the embryonic ontogeny of abalone. The abilities of PAEs affecting the osmoregulation, inducing oxidative stress, damaging embryo envelope structure, and causing physiological homeostasis disorder, are likely to be a part of the common mechanisms responsible for their embryonic toxicity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The 2163-bp cDNA contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1878. bp, a 42-bp 5'-untranslated region (UTR), and a 243-bp 3'-UTR including a stop codon (TAG), a poly A tail, and a putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) 14. bp upstream of the poly A tail. The ORF encoded a protein of 626 amino acids (aa) with a predicted molecular mass of 71.3. kDa and an estimated p. I of 5.55. The grouper Mx sequence contained putative functional domains including a tripartite guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding motif (GDQSSGKS, DLPG, and TKPD), the signature of the dynamin family (LPRGSGIVTR), and a putative leucine zipper in the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein. Sequence comparison showed that the Mx gene of this grouper had overall respective identities of 70%-96%, 51%-56%, and 34% to those of teleosts, mammals, and the abalone (Haliotis discus discus), respectively. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that the cloned Mx (TGMx) from tiger grouper was more-correlated with orange-spotted grouper MxII (gMxII). TGMx was constitutively expressed in all tissues, and its expression was upregulated by poly I:C and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), especially after a poly I:C injection. The Mx expressions had significantly increased in the eyes, head kidney, spleen, intestines, liver and gills after the LPS injection, and in all tested tissues after the poly I:C injection as compared to the groupers injected with PBS. The quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that Mx mRNA expression in the spleen and head kidney of grouper fed a diet containing sodium alginate and then injected with poly I:C after 12 h significantly increased, compared to those of fish fed a control diet (without sodium alginate). We therefore recommend an LPS and poly I:C injection to induce TGMx expression which was further enhanced by dietary sodium alginate administration. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.10.032,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83555165275

We then released 30 large juvenile abalone (mean SL, 51.5 mm) into each plot. The number of live outplanted abalone remaining in the complex substrate plots was significantly greater than in the control plots during the first 6 days. Surveys of a 4-m radius around each plot showed that emigration was lower from complex substrate plots than from control plots, and fewer shell fragments were found. The addition of complex substrate to plots provided crypsis from large predators but also resulted in significantly higher densities of small predators. Outplanting lower densities of abalone into larger plots of natural high-substrate complexity might attract fewer predatory sea stars and crabs, and thus result in higher survival rates.",10.2983/035.032.0123,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877250641

A new method employing an electronic scale and automated data capturing is evaluated as an alternative to current practices. A pilot study was conducted to determine feasibility of the concept. Sample data collected proved the system to be suitable for full scale implementation. © 2012 CIE & SAIIE.",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892951008
Chandia L.A.P.; Alfaro A.C.; Aguilar R.F.; Godoy M.; Venegas A.G.,"Histological evidence of accumulation of iron in postlarvae of red abalone, Haliotis rufescens",2012,Aquaculture Research,43,11,1635,1642,,"The effect of iron on abalone postlarvae (Haliotis rufescens) was investigated in a controlled-culturing system. Three iron concentrations (0.15, 1.5 and 15 mg L-1 of Fe) and a control (no iron added) were used to culture H. rufescens postlarvae while being fed the diatom Navicula inserta over 10 days. Results indicate that H. rufescens postlarvae accumulate iron granules in the stomach, digestive gland and mantle, but not in the gills or other tissues. The number and diameter of iron granules in tissues increased with increasing iron concentration in the culturing environment. The iron accumulation is assumed to have been acquired in the digestive system through the iron-enriched diatom feed and in the mantle through subcutaneous iron transfer. The lack of iron granules in the gills suggests that iron is not absorbed through the respiratory system, as is the case for many filter feeding bivalves. Exposure to the highest iron concentration (15 mg L-1) resulted in tissue abnormalities where granules accumulated, and may have significantly affected the health of H. rufescens postlarvae. These findings provide valuable information for the regulation of appropriate iron levels within aquaculture settings and highlights the importance of monitoring iron levels within abalone larval culturing environments. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1365-2109.2011.02969.x,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867340961

This 12-wk study investigated the interactions between 2 abalone year classes (1 y old, 1.8 g; 2 y old, 22.9 g), 3 water temperatures (14°C, 18°C, and 22°C), and 4 dietary protein levels (1 y old: 27%, 30%, 33%, and 36% crude protein; 2 y old: 24%, 27%, 30%, and 33% crude protein) to evaluate the potential to use diets to suit specific water temperatures and aged animals. Diets were formulated to be isoenergetic (∼12.5 MJ/kg digestible energy), and contain fat levels of ∼3.6% and digestible protein levels ranging from 17.99%-28.57%. Feed was fed to excess daily and uneaten food was collected. Temperature significantly affected the specific growth rate of both year classes of abalone. There was no significant effect of dietary protein level on specific growth rate; however, abalone compensated for a reduction of dietary protein by consuming more feed. This observation was evident with significant increases in feed conversion ratios as dietary protein levels decreased for both year classes. With the exception of abalone grown at 14°C, when protein deposition decreased with increasing dietary protein level, protein deposition increased with an increase in dietary protein for both year classes. For 1-y-old abalone, as temperature increased from 14-22°C, the optimum crude dietary protein levels increased from -29%-∼35%. For 2-y-old abalone, the optimum crude protein level appeared to be less, and increased from 24% at 14°C to 34% at 22°C.

Yazdi S.K.; Fashandi A.,The sustainable marine aquaculture,2012,Advances in Environmental Biology,6,1,9,12,,"Aquaculture is the keeping, breeding, hatching or culturing of fish. Fish used for aquaculture include nonpearl oysters, mussels, yabbies, marron, crayfish, abalone, prawns, freshwater and marine finfish, trochus and algae for beta carotene (ie any marine organism other than reptiles, birds and mammals). Global wild fisheries are in decline, with valuable habitat such as estuaries in critical condition. The aquaculture or farming of piscivorous fish, like salmon, does not help the problem because they need to eat products from other fish, such as fish meal and fish oil. Studies have shown that salmon farming has major negative impacts on wild salmon, as well as the forage fish that need to be caught to feed them. Apart from fish and shrimp, some aquaculture undertakings, such as seaweed and filterfeeding bivalve mollusks like oysters, clams, mussels and scallops, are relatively benign and even environmentally restorative. Filter-feeders filter pollutants as well as nutrients from the water, improving water quality. Some profitable aquaculture cooperatives promote sustainable practices. New methods lessen the risk of biological and chemical pollution through minimizing fish stress, fallowing netpens, and applying Integrated Pest Management. Vaccines are being used more and more to reduce antibiotic use for disease control. Onshore recirculating aquaculture systems, facilities using polyculture techniques, and properly sited facilities (e.g. offshore areas with strong currents) are examples of ways to manage negative environmental effects.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857403140

To test this hypothesis, a marine finfish, silver kob Argyrosomus inodorus, and a detritivorous polychaete, bloodworm Arenicola loveni loveni, were cultured in abalone farm effluent and the results compared to controls reared in unused seawater. The silver kob were fed a nutritionally complete pelleted diet whereas the bloodworm were placed in shallow tanks with a low water velocity that allowed suspended organic solids to settle for the detritivorous worms to feed on. Silver kob growth rate (0.48% body weight d -1; SE = 0.01%), mortality (1.8 ± 0.5%), feed conversion ratio (3.0 ± 0.2) and protein efficiency ratio (1.0 ± 0.1) did not differ significantly between the effluent and control treatments. Bloodworm reared in abalone effluent grew well on the particulate organic waste matter in the effluent (0.39% body weight gain d -1; SE = 0.07%), whereas those in the seawater control lost weight at 0.19 ± 0.04% body weight d -1 over the experimental period. Bloodworm mortality did not differ significantly between effluent (6 ± 3%) and unused seawater (11 ± 8%) treatments. The faster growth of bloodworm in the abalone farm effluent was ascribed to the higher deposition rate of enriched organic solids (182 ± 56 g m -2 d -1) compared with those grown in the seawater control (46 ± 13 g m -2 d -1).

Vásquez-León M.,"Policies of conservation and sustainable development: Fishing communities in the gulf of California, Mexico",2012,Neoliberalism and Commodity Production in Mexico,,,165,185,,"Since the late 1990s, Mexico's marine fisheries and coastal resources, like much of Mexico's rural sector, have been undergoing deep structural transformations as the country insists on rigorously implementing the neoliberal model. As in much of Latin America, neoliberal reforms have involved macroeconomic, agrarian, and environmental policies. These policies include the privatization of key economic sectors and state-owned industries, the liberalization of markets and establishment of international free trade agreements, major changes to banking and credit systems, the elimination of subsidies, and decentralization of state control. Even though the declared objectives of the neoliberal model are to sustain economic growth, improve life, and combat poverty, its impacts have been rather contradictory, as indicated by the numerous studies produced on the subject (e.g., Harvey 2005; Taylor 2002). The case of marine fisheries and coastal resources in the Gulf of California offers an interesting example of how the neoliberal model has subordinated local economic development efforts and generated a model of intensive and extensive exploitation of natural resources. Parallel to the privatization of ejidos (communally owned properties) in the Mexican agricultural sector (see Haenn 2006), marine fisheries also went through a process of privatization and commoditization. This process contradicts decades of state intervention in which fishers organized in cooperatives that held exclusive rights to capture such commercially valuable species as shrimp, lobster, and abalone. Starting in the 1930s the interests of local fishing cooperatives were represented at the national level by regional federations that formed part of a complex national organizational structure headed by the National Confederation of Cooperatives. Arguing corruption and inefficiency in the cooperative sector, the Carlos Salinas de Gortari administration officially dismantled the cooperative system in 1992. The first sally into the privatization process began in the late 1980s with the closure of the Banco Nacional Pesquero y Portuario (BANPESCA), the statecontrolled fisheries bank. Set up in the 1970s to develop the fishing industry, BANPESCA provided loans to fishing cooperatives for the purchase of boats and equipment at relatively benign rates. Through the 1970s and 1980s loans from BANPESCA led to a sharp increase in the number of shrimp boats, Mexico's most important commercial fishery. As the number of shrimp boats increased, catch per boat and total catch generally declined (see figures 8.1 and 8.2). By the end of the decade most cooperatives found themselves unable to repay their loans. This provided the justification to close the bank in the midst of allegations of corruption within the bank itself. The closure of BANPESCA crippled the fishing cooperatives, forcing many into bankruptcy and preparing the stage for privatization of the sector.1 In 1992, fishing rights to reserved species were transferred to private investors. The implementation of neoliberal reforms led to a considerable loss of local control over resources as small-scale and offshore fishers lost political representation and negotiating power with financial institutions, the private sector, and the state (Alcala 2003; Vasquez-Leon and McGuire 1994). At the same time, a strong trend toward conservation was set in motion in 1993 with the approval of the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation, an environmental side accord that addressed the lack of environmental provisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Under the arguments of resource overexploitation and an increase in the number of endangered species, a number of highly productive marine regions have been declared protected areas (Arbuto-Oropeza and Lopez-Sagastegui 2006), changing the legal status of fishing communities that in some cases are excluded from traditional fishing grounds (McGuire and Greenberg 1993). Today, as Daniel Lluch-Cota and colleagues (2007:2) point out, the Gulf of California is ""one of the marine systems most closely watched by the worldwide conservation sector."" By contrast, despite general concern over resource decline, the passage of NAFTA-a key piece in engineering neoliberal goals of free trade-made it easier for private investors, both Mexican and foreign, to invest in such capital-intensive enterprises as shrimp aquaculture and tourism infrastructure. As projected by the Mexican government, 30 percent of the once remote Gulf coastline would be under intensive economic use by 2010 (Diario Oficial 2006); this, in fact, did happen. These developments, as I shall discuss, increase pressures on marine and coastal resources and displace fishing communities, and they are unlikely to contribute in any substantial way to the economic well-being of local fishing households and communities. Instead, since the early 1990s, disputes among strong economic interests have led to conflicting views as to who should benefit from the region's resources. In this chapter I focus on the impact of neoliberal reform policies on the Gulf of California's small-scale fishers. These policies include privatization of marine and coastal resources, ""sustainable development"" strategies promoted by the state and private capital, changes in the structure of markets, and loss of credit and basic social services for small-scale producers. Socioeconomic studies in the Gulf of California since the early 1990s (Aubert 1997; Fernandez 2003; Greenberg 2006 [1998]; Lozano-Montes, Pitcher, and Haggan 2008; McGuire and Greenberg 1993; Vasquez-Leon 1995) have identified a progressive deterioration of the economies of marine-dependent communities and a decline in the productivity of a variety of commercial fisheries. After more than a decade of neoliberal reforms, poverty and resource scarcity have worsened, and today small-scale fishing households are being pressured to the point where marine-dependent livelihoods are becoming unviable. Even though neoliberal reforms-including environmental policies-have been undertaken in the name of efficiency and sustainability, fishers find themselves increasingly vulnerable as the state withdraws support for this sector in favor of industrial producers in offshore fisheries and shrimp aquaculture, tourism development, and conservationist concerns. I begin by examining the major problems impacting fishing communities in the Gulf of California. I then analyze the solutions proposed by the state, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and local communities to revive economies and conserve resources. Finally, I focus on traditional small-scale fishers and their communities to show how they perceive and are impacted by the problems and the proposed solutions. The problems discussed in this chapter are not unique to small-scale fishers in the Gulf of California; in Mexico, small-scale producers in other rural sectors are facing similar challenges (Haenn 2006; Vasquez-Leon and Liverman 2004; in this volume see Greenberg on coffee, Carter and Alexander on grapes, Weaver on forestry, and Emmanuel on ranching). © 2012 by University Press of Colorado.

Infected abalone are characterised by multifocal areas of necrosis of the epithelium, underlying muscle fibres and connective tissues of the foot, epipodium and mantle. The lesions are typically 2-3. mm in diameter and contain numerous hyphae. Affected aquaculture facilities have suffered significant production losses, with up to 90% mortality among spat and up to 30% mortality among older animals. The pathogen has been identified as Halioticida noduliformans Muraosa, Morimoto, Sano, Nishimura and Hatai, 2009 from the morphological characteristics, the physiological characteristics that were investigated and molecular analysis of the large subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU rRNA) gene. Although the optimum temperature for growth of the fungus was 20-25°C, it grew at a wide range of temperatures (10-25°C). No growth occurred at 5 and 30°C. The fungus grew well in peptone yeast glucose saline (PYGS) agar containing 50-100% seawater, with optimum growth occurring in full strength seawater (~. 35. ppt salinity). No vegetative growth was observed on PYG agar without seawater or supplemented exclusively with varying concentrations (0-5%) of NaCl. The isolate grew at a wide range of pH (4.0-10.0) with the optimum pH value of 7.0-8.0. The disease was reproduced in juvenile abalone (30-50. mm shell length) by artificial infection and the fungus was re-isolated from moribund abalone, demonstrating that the isolated H. noduliformans fungus is the cause of abalone tubercle mycosis disease that has been occurring in South Africa since 2006. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.02.004,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955022126

Two size classes (25-30 and 65-70mm) of Haliotis midae were fed diets with graded levels of lipid (4-16%), in which total protein varied (34-39%) to maintain a constant P:E (22g protein MJ -1). For both size classes, overall performance was best on diets containing 4% and 7% lipid. Above 7% lipid, specific growth rate, shell length increment and protein efficiency ratio decreased while feed consumption and FCR increased significantly. The observed deterioration in growth and nutritional performance in diets with >7% dietary lipid was more marked in the 65-70mm size class than in the 25-30mm class, indicating that the smaller size class were better equipped to metabolize higher levels of dietary lipid. We concluded that the observed decrease in growth and feed utlization with the increasing dietary lipid was not due to an imbalance of dietary protein relative to energy, but rather that H. midae is unable to effectively utilize lipids as an energy source at levels in excess of 7% due to inherent physiological constraints. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1365-2109.2010.02742.x,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052869570

Exposure of abalone to PST supplemented feed for 50 days did not affect behaviour or survival but saw accumulation of up to 1.6 μg STX-equivalent 100 g -1 in the abalone foot tissue (muscle, mouth without oesophagus and epipodial fringe), which is ∼50 times lower than the maximum permissible limit (80 μg 100 g -1 tissue) for PSTs in molluscan shellfish. The PST levels in the foot were reduced to 0.48 μg STX-equivalent 100 g -1 after scrubbing and removal of the pigment surrounding the epithelium of the epipodial fringe (confirmed by both HPLC and LC-MS/MS). Thus, scrubbing the epipodial fringe, a common procedure during commercial abalone canning, reduced PST levels by ∼70%. Only trace levels of PSTs were detected in the viscera (stomach, gut, heart, gonad, gills and mantle) of the abalone. A toxin reduction of approximately 73% was observed in STX-contaminated abalone held in clean water and fed uncontaminated food over 50 days. The low level of PST uptake when abalone were exposed to high numbers of A. minutum cells over a prolonged period may indicate a low risk of PSP poisoning to humans from the consumption of H. laevigata that has been exposed to a bloom of potentially toxic A. minutum in Australia. Further research is required to establish if non-dietary accumulation can result in significant levels of PSTs in abalone. © 2011.",10.1016/j.toxicon.2011.05.010,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959372610

Larvae and early juveniles were fed daily with diatoms, whereas late juveniles and adults were fed with artificial food and the green algae Ulva fasciata. Shell length and total wet weight from 40-80 randomly selected specimens in various experiments were measured monthly, and sex and gonad maturity stage were defined visually. The water parameters in tanks reflected the ambient condition of the Arabian Sea. The growth pattern of the abalone was very similar in the 3 experimental trials. Larvae and early juveniles have very fast growth rates, reaching an average 53-56 mm and 19-25 g after 1 y. Better results were obtained in the second and third experiments, when at the end of 2 y of rearing, abalone mean length was 67-72 mm and the weight was 46-54 g. At the age 3 y, abalone attained a mean length of 83-85 mm and a weight of 89-93 g. After 6 y, the abalone from the first experiment (2001 to 2005) showed, on average, 88.5 mm and 110.9 g. The length increments were the highest during the first year of the culture, whereas weight increments reached maximum values during the third (second and third trials) and fourth year (first trial) of rearing. After 4 y, abalone growth increments in weight decreased significantly. Males generally but not always have larger increments in length and weight when compared with females. During cultivation, a decrease in abalone weight was sometimes observed that, in most cases, coincided with decrease in water temperature during the southwest monsoon period (June to September). Some abalone sexually matured in tanks after 1 y, and mature males and females occurred almost year-round, with peaks in April to May and November to December. The length at first maturity was found to be 65.2 mm for males and 67.1 mm for females. Growth parameters for a von Bertalanffy function were calculated using data from different experiments. The growth rate coefficient in the first experiment was lower (K = 0.65), but in third experiment it appeared higher (K = 0.80) than in natural conditions from data other authors calculated based on length-frequency distribution analysis, which indicates faster growth rates of abalone in tanks when compared with those in the wild.

To investigate the development of gut microflora in the small abalone Haliotis diversicolor and the effect of various diets on the bacterial communities, we analyzed the composition of gut microbial flora and the bacterial digestive enzymes in connection with four important development stages, i.e., larva, early-juvenile, late-juvenile and grow-out. Among these cultivated bacteria, the Firmicutes group was isolated from both the larval and early-juvenile stages; the CFB (Cytophaga/. Flexibacteria/. Bacterioides) group was detected in early juveniles, late juveniles and grow-out; the γ-proteobacteria existed throughout the four development stages. The isolated Bacillus sp. and Pseudoalteromonas sp. dominated in the larvae and were rarely detected in other stages. Subsequently, the genus Vibrio predominated in the latter three phases after the first feeding. Cluster analysis of the DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis) patterns was basically congruent with the result of culture-dependent method in which the gut bacterial community indicated the successional change in the development stages. And the artificial diets contribute to the change of gut bacterial composition to some extent. The enzyme assay showed that the gut bacteria isolated from the early juveniles produced the greatest diverse digestive enzymes compared with those isolated from other development stages. Most cultivated bacteria in each development stage showed protease, lipase or alginate-degrading activities which could help the farmed abalone H. diversicolor to digest diets.

It is shown that when abalone Haliotis rufescens of different sizes were fed with a natural diet composed of fronds of the macroalga Macrocystis integrifolia supplemented with a mixture of Vibrio sp. C21-UMA, Agarivorans albus F1-UMA and Vibrio sp. F15-UMA bacteria, there was a significant increase (P<0.05) in the average monthly growth rate and survival (%)in a period of 210 days, compared with the control without a probiotic supplement. The permanence of the probiotics in the digestive tract of the animals was monitored, and it was found that the number of culturable C21-UMA and F1-UMA bacteria decreased significantly (P<0.05) in recently weaned and adult abalone, and they almost disappeared completely on day 19 of the bioassay. However, the culturable Vibrio sp. F15-UMA disappeared completely from the digestive tract on day 22 of the bioassay, and these were the bacteria that remained at the highest concentration compared with the other two bacterial strains over the experimental period. It is therefore shown that it is feasible to use a probiotic mixture to improve the profitability of the H. rufescens culture. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1365-2109.2010.02678.x,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958753463

In this study, an hsp90 gene was isolated from disc abalone (Haliotis discus). The complete nucleotide sequence of the hsp90 gene contains an open reading frame of 2,184 base pairs, encoding an 84 kDa protein. Disk abalone hsp90 shares high sequence similarity with other hsp90 family proteins. Although the phylogenetic analysis did not classify it into the hsp90α group, the inductivity of this gene was confirmed by heat shock and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge test. Disk abalone hsp90 gene displayed a rapid and reversible induction response to both an exposure of typical heat shock and the LPS challenge. Once given the sublethal heat shock treatment, the transcription of disk abalone hsp90 gene was significantly up-regulated. With a recovery of 12 h, the transcription of disk abalone hsp90 gene gradually attenuated to the control level. These observations reflected the feedback regulation of abalone heat shock responses faithfully. In response to LPS challenge, the transcription of disk abalone hsp90 gene was significantly increased within 2 h and it approached maximum induction at 4 h later and recovered finally the reference level in 24 h. Take all together, the cloning and expression analysis of disk abalone hsp90 gene provided useful molecular information of abalone responses in stress conditions and potential ways to monitor the chronic stressors in abalone culture environments and diagnose the animal health status.",10.1007/s11033-010-9972-x,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052470373

Performance relates directly to the nutritional value of algae - or any feedstock - which in turn is driven by the amino acid content and profile, and specifically the content of the limiting essential amino acids. However, the relationship between feeding preferences, consumption and amino acid content of algae have rarely been simultaneously investigated for abalone, and never for the emerging target species Haliotis asinina. Here we found that the tropical H. asinina had strong and consistent preferences for the red alga Hypnea pannosa and the green alga Ulva flexuosa, but no overarching relationship between protein content (sum of amino acids) and preference existed. For example, preferred Hypnea and Ulva had distinctly different protein contents (12.64 vs. 2.99 g 100 g-1) and the protein-rich Asparagopsis taxiformis (>15 g 100 g-1 of dry weight) was one of the least preferred algae. The limiting amino acid in all algae was methionine, followed by histidine or lysine. Furthermore we demonstrated that preferences can largely be removed using carrageenan as a binder for dried alga, most likely acting as a feeding attractant or stimulant. The apparent decoupling between feeding preference and algal nutritive values may be due to a trade off between nutritive values and grazing deterrence associated with physical and chemical properties. © 2012 Angell et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0038857,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862240438

The current study quantified the protein contents of Ulva rigida and Ulva capensis from natural populations and Ulva lactuca from a commercial, integrated seaweed/abalone aquaculture system. Three methods of protein quantification were used: the Bradford method, crude protein, and specific nitrogen to protein (N-Prot) conversion factors, and results were compared to each other. The results showed that values obtained with the ""traditional"" conversion factor of 6. 25 were on average higher than Bradford values by factors of 64. 1 % in U. capensis, 77. 1 % in U. rigida and 58. 9 % in U. lactuca. This pattern is in line with other published work on seaweed and microalgae. Analyses of amino acid composition showed that aspartic acid was the most abundant amino acid and that these species were also rich in glycine and alanine but poor in histidine, methionine and cysteine. N-Prot factors were as follows: U. capensis, 5. 58; U. rigida, 5. 12 and U. lactuca, 5. 65.

These results enable a realistic depiction of the formation of the terraced cones that comprise the principal biomineralization mechanism in this gastropod. In all cases, the growth initiated through spherulites, followed by tile formation. The transient stage with spherulitic formation was shorter at higher temperature; this is indicative of a greater activity of the animal at 21 °C. The growth rate in a normally fed gastropod was found to be higher compared with one provided with limited food. The effect of water temperature (seasonal) was also established, with growth proceeding faster in the summer (T ∼ 21 °C) than in winter (15 °C).

Wild and cultured abalone both attract premium prices, but generally this is not based on sensory characteristics. Yet, abalone aquaculture is developing to provide an alternative to a dwindling supply of wild abalone, and this provides an opportunity to optimize the sensory properties if they are better understood. In most natural food products, farming practices and growing environment are responsible for the sensory properties of the final product; therefore, the comparison of both wild and aquacultured abalone's sensory characteristics could contribute to a better understanding of the impact of the growing and farming practices on the sensory properties. Our study focused on the development of a descriptive sensory analysis methodology to measure abalone sensory properties, and the observation of differences among the abalone sampled. Wild and aquacultured abalone were prepared according to a standardized cooking protocol. A sensory panel of trained assessors developed and defined a descriptive vocabulary and a method of assessment, and then quantified the sensory properties of abalone. A vocabulary of 16 terms describing aroma, texture, flavor, and aftertaste of the abalone was developed. Very significant differences were found between abalone sourced from the wild and aquacultured abalone from different sources. The wild-caught blacklip abalone, which were larger in size, were perceived as more firm, springy, and chewy, but also rated significantly higher in aroma, flavor, and aftertaste impact as well as earthy and metallic flavors. Significant differences in sensory properties were also found between cultured abalone fed different diets. Compositional analysis showed significant differences between abalone in their content of glycogen (range, 4.8%-23.2% of dry weight (DW)), moisture (69.4%-73.7% live weight), and taste-active free amino acids, especially glycine (3.4-18.2 mg/g DW) and glutamate (1.0-3.6 mg/g DW). Correlations were found between sensory attributes and some chemical compounds. This study indicates that growing conditions as well as growing techniques may have a large influence on abalone sensory characteristics. However, because the design of the study was not balanced for key growth or production variables, additional studies are required to identify and quantify which factors were most influential.

In this study, a novel TLR homolog from disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) was identified and characterized at molecular level. The open reading frame (ORF) of AbTLR is 3804bp in length and encodes a 1268 amino acid peptide with a calculated molecular mass of 143.5kDa. The deduced protein shows typical TLR domain architecture, with leucine rich repeats (LRR) and the toll-interleukin receptor (TIR) domain. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close evolutionary relationship for AbTLR to its invertebrate counterparts, with close clustering to the molluscan homologs. Quantitative real-time PCR detected ubiquitous transcription of AbTLR in healthy tissues, but with highest levels in hemocytes. Differential transcriptional modulation of AbTLR was observed in abalone hemocytes and gills upon immune challenge, whereby Vibrio parahaemolyticus and purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced the transcript level prominently. In addition, the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus induced AbTLR transcription in hemocytes and gills, representing the first evidence of viral-induced immune response in mollusks to date. Collectively, our findings support a putative role for AbTLR in abalone antiviral and antibacterial defense. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.fsi.2013.04.031,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880036143

Abalone were fed Gracilaria sp. within a randomized 2 × 3 factorial experiment using 2 stocking densities (Tl (500 pieces/m 2) and T2 (1,000 pieces/m2)) and 3 cages (D1, box; D2, mesh cage; D3, prefabricated multitier trays). In addition, 3 stocking densities (T1, 50 pieces/m ; T2, 100 pieces/m; T3, 200 pieces/m) were evaluated in the prefabricated multitier trays. We found that, in the nursery experiment, 4-mo-old tropical abalone juveniles reared for 90 d showed no significant differences in growth (shell length and body weight) and survival rates among the 3 nursery cages used (Tukey's post hoc test, P > 0.05). Feed conversion ratio, however, was lowest for the high-density treatment T1D3 (7.8 ± 0.76) and was significantly different from the low density treatment T1D1 (11.32 ± 1.2) and intermediate density treatment T1D2 (12.39 ± 1.12; t-test, P > 0.05). Conversely, at higher densities (T2), the same trend applied with abalone reared in multitier basket systems (T2D3), having the highest growth rates and survival rates (29.3 ± 0.07 mm average shell length (ASL) and 5.16 ± 0.52 g average body weight (ABW)), followed closely by those reared in mesh cages (T2D2) and boxes (T2D1). Feed conversion ratio was also lowest for T2D3 (7.56 ± 0.79) and was significantly lower than T2D1 and T2D2. Between treatments, however, abalone reared at lower densities (T1) had significantly higher growth and survival than those reared at higher densities (T2), regardless of the nursery cage used, indicating an inverse relationship between stocking density, growth, and survival. For the grow-out study, tropical abalone reared in multitier trays at low densities (T1) attained the highest growth in shell length and body weight (49.7 ± 0.11 mm ASL and 29.8 ± 2.6 g ABW, respectively) at 180 d of culture, which was significantly greater than those reared in the high-density treatment (T3) with significantly smaller shell length and body weight (43.8 ± 0.18 mm ASL and 21.2 ± 2.0 g ABW), but not significantly different than the intermediate density treatment. This trend started from day 60 of culture onward when analyzed using Duncan's multiple range test (P > 0.05). Survival rates were not significantly different among stocking density treatments, nor were feed conversion ratios. We recommend, for nursery rearing of abalone juveniles, using multitier trays (D3) or boxes (D1) at 500 pieces/m2 stocking density to attain a grow-out size of 26-30 mm in shell length in 90 days. A stocking density of 100 pieces/m2 is recommended to grow abalone in multitier trays to attain a cocktail size of 50 mm ASL and 30 g ABW in 180 d with survival rates between 85.6% and 83.1%.",10.2983/035.032.0105,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877284288

Research has shown that their emergent mechanical properties are owed in part to their specific self-organization in hierarchical molecular structures, from nanoscale to macroscale, as well as their mixing and bonding. To apply these findings to manmade materials, researchers have devoted significant efforts in developing a fundamental understanding of multiscale mechanics of materials and its application to the design of novel materials with superior mechanical performance. These efforts included the utilization of some of the most promising carbon-based nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, and graphene, together with a variety of matrix materials. At the core of these efforts lies the need to characterize material mechanical behavior across multiple length scales starting from nanoscale characterization of constituents and their interactions to emerging micro- and macroscale properties. In this report, progress made in experimental tools and methods currently used for material characterization across multiple length scales is reviewed, as well as a discussion of how they have impacted our current understanding of the mechanics of hierarchical carbon-based materials. In addition, insight is provided into strategies for bridging experiments across length scales, which are essential in establishing a multiscale characterization approach. While the focus of this progress report is in experimental methods, their concerted use with theoretical-computational approaches towards the establishment of a robust material by design methodology is also discussed, which can pave the way for the development of novel materials possessing unprecedented mechanical properties.

At the same time and locations, theoretical reproductive outputs were computed by combining estimates of abalone densities and size structure with literature data on size-dependent fecundity and size at sexual maturity. We found that observed settlement rates correlated positively and significantly with estimated reproductive output, suggesting that greater production of eggs by large and fecund individuals can result in predictably high recruitment rates. In addition, the slope of the linear relationship suggests that the proportion of eggs that settle and metamorphose to become postlarvae is between 0.2% and 0.3%. Although affected by great uncertainty, this value constitutes a unique estimate of larval survival for the genus Haliotis in a natural environment.",10.2983/035.032.0122,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877263862

Under applied stress these components slide on one another, generating inelastic deformations and toughness at the macroscale. This mechanism is prominent in nacre, a remarkable material which is now serving as model for biomimetic materials. In this work the microstructure, performance and mechanics of nacres from four species (red abalone, top shell, pearl oyster and pen shell) were determined and compared in order to gain new insights into structure-performance relationships in staggered structures. Fracture tests revealed that all nacres display a rising crack resistance curve, but that some nacres are tougher than the others. In addition all nacres generated inelastic deformations ahead of the crack tip, whose size correlated well with the amount of toughening, which confirmed that energy dissipation in these inelastic regions is a prominent source of toughness. Nacre from pearl oyster was found to be the toughest, suggesting it as a potential model for biomimetic materials. For the first time remarkable deformation and fracture patterns were observed in that material using in-situ optical and atomic force microscopy. Under stress, stair-like thin deformation bands deform at an angle from the loading direction, forming a dense, tree-like network. This marks a clear difference from the now well documented ""columnar"" failure mode observed in red abalone, where deformation bands perpendicular to the loading direction form homogeneous inelastic region. A micromechanics model revealed that the transition between columnar and stair failure modes is controlled by the amount of overlap between the tablets and local shear stresses induced by inhomogeneities in the material. Large scale numerical models of staggered structures confirmed this observation. Similar ""stair"" failure scenario may also occur in bone, which has a microstructure in many ways similar to sheet nacre.",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865627960

In the current study, we identified, cloned, and characterized a gene that encodes an invertebrate-type lysozyme from the disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus (abLysI). The full-length cDNA of abLysI consisted of 545bp with an open reading frame of 393bp that encodes 131 amino acids. The theoretical molecular mass of mature abLysI was 12.3kDa with an isoelectric point of 8.03. Conserved features in other homologs, such as catalytic sites for lytic activity (Glu30 and Asp41), isopeptidase activity (His107), and ten cysteine residues were identified in abLysI. Genomic sequence analysis with respect to its cDNA showed that abLysI was organized into four exons interrupted by three introns. Several immune-related transcription factor binding sites were discovered in the putative promoter region. Homology and phylogeny analysis of abLysI depicted high identity and closer proximity, respectively, with an annelid i-type lysozyme from Hirudo medicinalis, and indicated that abLysI is a novel molluscan i-type lysozyme. Tissue-specific expressional studies revealed that abLysI is mainly transcribed in hepatopancreas followed by mantle. In addition, abLysI mRNA expression was induced following bacterial (Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes) and viral (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus) challenges. Recombinantly expressed abLysI [(r)abLysI] demonstrated strong lytic activity against Micrococcus lysodeikticus, isopeptidase activity, and antibacterial activity against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, (r)abLysI showed optimum lytic activity at pH 4.0 and 60°C, while exhibiting optimum isopeptidase activity at pH 7.0.

Selenium concentration in the soft body and the activity of glutathione peroxidase in serum were significantly (P<0.05) increased with dietary selenium. Significant higher activities of phenoloxidase (PO) and lysozyme in serum were observed in the treatment with 0.88. mg. Se/kg diet, compared with those in 9.16. mg. Se/kg diet. However, the protein concentration in serum maintained relatively constant regardless of dietary treatments. The dietary selenium requirement of juvenile abalone was estimated to be 1.408. mg/kg, using second-order polynomial regression analysis. The toxicity of high level of dietary selenium (9.16. mg/kg) to juvenile abalone was characterized by depressed growth performances and decreased activities of PO and lysozyme in serum. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.11.032,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856329015
Tung C.-H.; Alfaro A.C.,Effect of dietary protein and temperature on the growth and health of juvenile New Zealand black-footed abalone (Haliotis iris),2011,Aquaculture Research,42,3,366,385,,"The protein requirements for optimal growth and health of juvenile New Zealand black-footed abalone (Haliotis iris) under different water temperatures were investigated. Six diets with different crude protein amounts (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 45%) and two temperature regimes (13-21 and 8-16°C) were used to culture juvenile abalone over a 4-month period. Growth (shell lengths and animal weights) and health (survival, activity and mucous production) parameters were recorded for animals within all protein and temperature combinations. Proximate analyses and amino acid profiles were also performed on the diets, soft bodies (including gonad), and shells to evaluate the overall nutrient contents (diet and animal) and requirements (animal). The results indicate that the protein requirements for juvenile H. iris are higher when the environmental temperatures are low. Thus, increasing the dietary protein level results in better growth [i.e. increase in soft body (including gonad) crude protein and mean protein gain] and health (i.e. more goblet cells and thicker epithelial layers). Results from amino acid profiles in abalone soft bodies (including gonad) and shells show that these parameters did not change considerably with different dietary protein levels, but temperature did affect the concentration of several amino acids in both soft bodies (including gonad) and shells. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1365-2109.2010.02631.x,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551616144

In the present study, the GABARAP full-length cDNA and its genomic DNA were firstly cloned from small abalone (Haliotis diversicolor), which was named as saGABARAP. Its full-length cDNA is 963 bp with a 354 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 117 aa, a 276 bp 5'-UTR, and a 333 bp 3'-UTR including a poly(A) tail, two typical polyadenylation signals (AATAA) and two RNA instability motifs (ATTTA). The deduced protein has an estimated molecular weight of 13.9 kDa and a predicted PI of 8.73. Its genomic DNA comprises 4352 bp, containing three exons and two introns. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that saGABARAP was constitutively expressed in all examined tissues, with the highest expression level in hepatopancreas, and was upregulated in hepatopancreas and hemocytes after bacterial challenge. In addition, saGABARAP was ubiquitously expressed at all examined embryonic and larval development stages. These results suggested that saGABARAP could respond to bacteria challenge and may play a vital role in the adult innate immune system against pathogens and the development process of abalone embryo and larvae. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.fsi.2012.05.003,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866769359

The effects of asparagus straw substrate on yield, polysaccharides content and antioxidant properties of these two mushrooms were studied. On non-supplemented asparagus straw substrate, the yield of P. geesteranus (199g/bag) was significantly higher than that of P. abalones (140g/bag) while the polysaccharides content of P. abalones was significantly higher than that of P. geesteranus. Addition of appropriate amounts of glucose, MgSO 4 and K 2HPO 4 to the substrate increased the mushroom yield of P. geesteranus significantly. Addition of saccharides and inorganic salts to the substrate had no remarkable effect on the polysaccharides content of P. geesteranus fruit bodies, whereas caused the significant decrease of the polysaccharides content of P. abalones fruit bodies compared with the control. According to the scavenging effect on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicals and reducing power of ethanolic extracts from two mushrooms, it was shown that the antioxidant properties of P. abalones was superior to that of P. geesteranus on non-supplemented asparagus straw substrate, and the supplementation of sucrose+MgSO 4 to the substrate was favorable to the enhancement of antioxidant activity of two mushrooms. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scienta.2011.11.005,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855597281

Thirty juvenile abalone averaging 15.7 g were randomly stocked into 18 50-L plastic rectangular containers each. Six treatments were prepared in triplicate: Abalone were fed the dry sea tangle once a day at a satiation level with a little leftover for 16 wk as the control (Con) and other abalone were fed the dry sea tangle once a day at a satiation level with a little leftover for 15 wk after 1-wk starvation (S1 treatment), 14 wk after 2-wk starvation (S2 treatment), 13 wk after 3-wk starvation (S3 treatment), 12 wk after 4-wk starvation (S4 treatment), and 10 wk after 6-wk starvation (S6 treatment), respectively. A linear relationship between weight change of abalone and wk of starvation was observed: Y (Weight of abalone) = -0.17X (Wk of starvation) + 15.89 (R 2 = 0.9462) (P < 0.0001). The highest survival of abalone was achieved in the S2 treatment, but not different from that of abalone in the Con, S1 and S3 treatments.

Taking into account that sustainable, eco-friendly production methods are to be a part of future expansion of the abalone industry, growth performance of juvenile abalone reared in an integrated culture system was evaluated and compared with that of abalone fed non-enriched macroalgae. Four macroalgae treatments, three monospecific: Ulva rigida (UN), Hypnea spinella (HN) and Gracilaria cornea (GN) and a composite one (MN), were produced out of fishpond wastewater effluents, while other four control treatments consisted of the same species reared in fresh seawater (U; H; G; M). Seaweeds reared in fishpond wastewater effluents increased their protein content from 11-17% to 29-34%. Lipids consisted mainly of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (43-60%), palmitic acid being the most abundant fatty acid (40-47%). Highest EPA percentage was found in red algae H. spinella (6.9%), being ten times higher than that of U. rigida (0.7%). All the algae tested contained very low levels of arachinodic acid (0.1-1.6%) and docosahexaenoic acid (0.5-3%). Protein levels in foot muscle (74-76%) did not differ significantly (P < 0.05) among treatments. Survival was generally high, ranging from 85 to 100%. Weight gain (17-561%) and SGR (0.2-2.3%) were positively related to protein content; whereas, protein efficiency ratio (PER) (0.5-3.7) was negative correlated. PE ratios increased by 82-159% (DW) as a function of the enrichment among the different diets. Food conversion ratio (FCR) (7-188) improved according to the increase in PER. Overall, biofilter-produced macroalgae showed a significantly higher dietary value compared to the control treatments. Similarly, animals fed the mixed diets performed significantly better than those fed a single algal diet. Feeding G. cornea led to the lowest growth performance probably due to the lowest feed intake. The results clearly indicate that H. tuberculata coccinea growout can efficiently take place in an integrated-culture system suggesting that on-farm seaweed-abalone production could be part of future development of the abalone industry in the Canary Islands. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.07.024,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052357617

N 2O is generated during microbial nitrification and denitrification, which are common in aquaculture systems. To date, few studies have been conducted to quantify N 2O emission from aquaculture. Additionally, very little is known with respect to the microbial pathways through which N 2O is formed in aquaculture systems. This review suggests that aquaculture can be an important anthropogenic source of N 2O emission. The global N 2O-N emission from aquaculture in 2009 is estimated to be 9.30 x 10 10 g, and will increase to 3.83 x 10 11g which could account for 5.72% of anthropogenic N 2O-N emission by 2030 if the aquaculture industry continues to increase at the present annual growth rate (about 7.10%). The possible mechanisms and various factors affecting N 2O production are summarized, and two possible methods to minimize N 2O emission, namely aquaponic and biofloc technology aquaculture, are also discussed. The paper concludes with future research directions. (Figure Presented). © 2012 American Chemical Society.",10.1021/es300110x,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862540853

The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the isolated antibacterial peptides, named as Nod1 and Nod2, were identified by Edman degradation and did not show any similarity to other proteins and peptides in databases based on results of BLAST homology analysis. Molecular masses of Nod1 and Nod2 were 6145.06 and 6360.07 Da, respectively, as determined by mass spectrometric analysis. The two peptides displayed pH-dependent antibacterial activity against various bacteria that was more potent at pH 5.4 than pH 7.4, but they did not inhibit fungal growth at either pH levels. Their antibacterial activity was due to membranolytic action, which was assayed by SYTOX-green uptake. In addition, both peptides were virtually noncytolytic for human erythrocytes and mammalian cells. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",10.1021/jf3006646,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863959037

Twenty microalgal strains, isolated from rocky shores and sandy estuaries, were grown in the laboratory to produce young and matured monospecific biofilms. Abalone larvae were exposed to the different biofilm treatments and controls (no biofilms) for 7 (attachment and metamorphosis) and 14 (shell stage and survival) d. The larvae performed significantly better in biofilms compared with controls across microalgal strains, but attachment, metamorphosis, shell stage, and survival were generally less than about 50, 35, 25, and 25%, respectively. Some microalgal strains belonging to the same species but collected from different sites had different effects on the larvae, likely due to variations in biochemical composition and activity among strains. Although no clear relationship was found between the microalgal amino acid profiles and larval processes, percentage biofilm cover and total amino acids were positively correlated with some of these processes. In addition, abalone performed significantly better when exposed to mature compared with young biofilms. These results may be due to the greater amounts of microalgal cells and their extracellular polymers within older biofilms, which may cue larvae toward more nutritionally favorable environments. © Copyright by the World Aquaculture Society 2011.",10.1111/j.1749-7345.2011.00454.x,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953290345

Most abalone actively fed on all algal diets, but large variations in the growth rate were observed among the diets and abalone growth stages. Mean growth rates of abalone fed Nitzschia sp. were similar or higher than those fed the macroalgal gametophytes in 1.4-4.6mm SL, but lower in 4.4-8.3mm SL. For all of the three macroalgal gametophytes, growth rates of the abalone increased linearly from 2-3mm SL and were highest at around 6mm SL. However, mean growth rates of larger individuals (7.6-12.0mm SL) dropped to less than 45μmday-1 in all treatments with the macroalgal or diatom diets. These results indicate that gametophytes of the three brown algae are favorable diets for juvenile H. diversicolor of 3-8mm SL.

Fish and shellfish are the most common seafood that cause adverse allergic reactions among nations; the symptoms ranged from oral allergy syndromes to urticaria and anaphylaxis. The major identified allergens are parvalbumin in fish and tropomyosin in shellfish. Nevertheless, such studies are lacking from some regions with high fish and seafood consumption.

Examples span polar (Antarctic krill fishery), temperate (west coast pelagic fishery, abalone and rock lobster), and tropical (Torres Strait rock lobster) commercially important fisheries. Responses of these fisheries to either past observed environmental changes or projected future changes are used to deduce some anticipated implications of climate change for fisheries management, including economic impacts and governance considerations. We evaluate the effectiveness of current single-species assessment models, management strategy evaluation approaches and multispecies assessment models as future management tools to cope with likely climate-related changes. Non-spatial stock assessment models will have limited ability to separate fishery effects from the impacts of climate change.

Hybrid exhibiting additivity or overdominance accounted for 73.9% of these 46 identified proteins. The 46 differentially expressed proteins were shown to be involved in major biological processes, including muscle contraction and regulation, energy metabolism, and stress response. The proteins involved in energy metabolism included adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase β subunit, fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase, triosephosphate isomerase, enolase, arginine kinase, and tauropine dehydrogenase. These proteins exhibited additivity in their offspring. The proteins involved in stress responses included HSP Hsp70 (exhibiting overdominance in the offspring) and Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (exhibiting additivity).

This process, known as ocean acidification, is a potential threat to marine populations via alterations in survival and development. To date, however, little research has examined the effects of ocean acidification on rare or endangered species. To begin to assess the impacts of acidification on endangered northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana) populations, we exposed H. kamtschatkana larvae to various levels of CO2 [400ppm (ambient), 800ppm, and 1800ppm CO2] and measured survival, settlement, shell size, and shell development. Larval survival decreased by ca. 40% in elevated CO2 treatments relative to the 400ppm control. However, CO2 had no effect on the proportion of surviving larvae that metamorphosed at the end of the experiment. Larval shell abnormalities became apparent in approximately 40% of larvae reared at 800ppm CO2, and almost all larvae reared at 1800ppm CO2 either developed an abnormal shell or lacked a shell completely. Of the larvae that did not show shell abnormalities, shell size was reduced by 5% at 800ppm compared to the control. Overall, larval development of H. kamtschatkana was found to be sensitive to ocean acidification. Near future levels of CO2 will likely pose a significant additional threat to this species, which is already endangered with extinction due in part to limited reproductive output and larval recruitment. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jembe.2011.02.002,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955081673

Relative to the mainland and other Channel Islands, San Miguel Island (SMI) consistently maintains cooler water temperatures and supports significant populations of red abalone Haliotis rufescens, presumably owing to increased food production and diminished expression of the bacterial disease known as withering syndrome.We conducted a laboratory experiment to examine the effects of La Nĩna and El Nĩno conditions on the health and survival of red abalone from SMI. Six replicate tanks per treatment, each containing six abalone, were subjected to one of the following three temperature regimes (treatments): Bodega Bay, California ambient (AMB; mean, 11.4°C), SMI La Nĩna regime (LAN; mean, 13.8°C), and SMI El Nĩno regime (ELN; mean, 16.5°C). After 328 d, survival in the ELN treatment was significantly lower than in the AMB and LAN groups. A body condition index was significantly lower in the ELN group than in the AMB group, and the LAN group was in between. A visual score of body shrinkage was significantly higher in both the LAN and ELN groups than in the AMB group. Other clinical signs of withering syndrome and the prevalence and infection intensity of the causative agent, Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis, increased as temperature increased in the three treatment groups from AMB to LAN to ELN, although the differences were not statistically significant.

Abalone growth was temperature dependent, declining from 4.33gmonth -1 at 18°C to 0.77gmonth -1 at 24°C. Shell length and weight gain were independent of dietary protein, provided that the digestible energy content of the diet was not lower than 13.5MJkg -1. Dietary energy levels below 13.5MJ kg -1 resulted in significant reductions in shell growth, weight gain and increased mortality from 5% to 27%.

The strains were phenotypically characterized and sequenced (16S rDNA). Strain GHrC11 was a Gram-positive coccobacillum, while strains GHrC13 and GHrC15 were Gram-negative bacilli. Strain GHrC11 was identified as Exiguobacterium sp. The strains GHrC13 and GHrC15 were identified as Vibrio splendidus. The effects of these strains for the development of early abalone postlarvae (2 days old) were evaluated following a completely randomized design with three replicates using 5-mL-volume Petri dishes as experimental units. The experiment considered two different bacterial concentrations of each strain (103 and 105 cells ml-1) and two controls (with and without the benthic diatom Navicula incerta). After 10 days of experimentation, the highest mortality (90 ± 5.8 %) and the lowest growth rate (4.1 ± 0.1 μm day-1) were recorded for the strain GHrC11. In contrast, the lower mortality (16.7 ± 3.3 %) and the highest growth rate (11.2 ± 0.9 μm day-1) corresponded to the control fed N. incerta. Our results suggest that pathogenic effects of these bacterial strains were stronger than any potential benefits derived from the ingestion of bacteria by early abalone postlarvae.

Ojima T.,Polysaccharide-degrading enzymes from herbivorous marine invertebrates,2013,"Marine Enzymes for Biocatalysis: Sources, Biocatalytic Characteristics and Bioprocesses of Marine Enzymes",,,333,371,,"Herbivorous marine molluscs such as abalone, sea hare and small snails possess various kinds of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes that efficiently depolymerize seaweed polysaccharides, e.g., alginate, mannan, laminarin and cellulose. These enzymes play important roles in the molluscs to digest seaweed fronds and obtain oligosaccharides and monosaccharides as carbohydrate nutrients. On the other hand, such seaweed poly- and oligosaccharides are known to exhibit various beneficial functions on humans, e.g., easing intestinal disorders, mollification of blood-sugar increase, antitumor and antihypertensive functions. In addition, such seaweed saccharides are recognized as potential raw materials for biofuels that will not cause serious conflicts between foods and fuels, unlike land crops. In this context, enzymes that can degrade seaweed polysaccharides are regarded as key biocatalysts for the production of value-added carbohydrates from seaweed. The enzymes from herbivorous marine molluscs appear to have some advantageous properties compared with the enzymes from terrestrial organisms since the molluscan enzymes should have evolved under the seaweed-feeding constraints of the animals. Therefore, investigation for such enzymes would provide us with useful information about how we should digest seaweed to produce value-added oligo- and monosaccharides in a reasonable way. In this chapter, we review the general properties of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes of herbivorous molluscs, specially focusing on alginate lyase, mannanase, laminarinase and cellulase. © 2013 Woodhead Publishing Limited.

Based on viral genome sequence information, a virus-specific real-time TaqMan assay was developed for detection and identification of the abalone herpes-like virus (AbHV). The assay was shown to be specific as it did not detect other viruses from either the Herpesvirales or the Iridovirales orders which have genome sequence similarities. However, the TaqMan assay was able to detect DNA from the Taiwanese abalone herpes-like virus, suggesting a relationship between the Taiwanese and Australian viruses. In addition, the assay detected <300 copies of recombinant plasmid DNA per reaction. Performance characteristics for the AbHV TaqMan assay were established using 1673 samples from different abalone populations in Victoria and Tasmania. The highest diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 96.7 (95% CI: 82.7 to 99.4) and 99.7 (95% CI: 99.3 to 99.9), respectively, at a threshold cycle (CT) value of 35.8. The results from 2 separate laboratories indicated good repeatability and reproducibility. This molecular assay has already proven useful in confirming presumptive diagnosis (based on the presence of ganglioneuritis) of diseased abalone in Victorian waters as well as being a tool for surveillance of wild abalone stocks in other parts of Australia. © Inter-Research 2010.",10.3354/dao02277,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049478169

Five macroalgae, Ulva sp. (Chlorophyta), Eisenia arborea, Macrocystis pyrifera, Egregia menziesii (Phaeophyta) and Porphyra perforata (Rhodophyta) were tested. The macroalgae promoted growth, although, depending on the species, there were considerable differences in growth, feed efficiency and biochemical composition of the digestive gland and muscle. Mean growth rate in length and weight and survival rate varied within the ranges 1.6-15.1 μm day-1, 1.4-8.1mgday-1 and 44-69%, respectively. Significantly, higher growth rates were obtained from Egregia menziesii, M. pyrifera and P. perforata. Feed conversion ratio ranged from 6.5 to 42.4 for P. perforata and Ulva sp. Protein, carbohydrates and lipid contents in the digestive gland ranged from 113 to 180, 98.3 to 448 and 17.2 to 23.3mgg-1, respectively. In muscle, the ranges were 66.9-123, 9.5-23.2 and 2.8-3.9mgg-1, respectively. This study shows that rehydrated Egregia menziesii, M. pyrifera and, particularly, P. perforata are more efficient in promoting growth than Ulva sp. and E. arborea which match results reported by other authors when using the same fresh macroalgae. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1365-2095.2009.00733.x,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952497803

In this study, we have demonstrated the presence and distribution of two isoforms of GnRH-like peptides in neural ganglia and ovary of reproductively mature female abalone, Haliotis asinina, using immunohistochemistry. We found significant immunoreactivities (ir) of anti-lamprey(l) GnRH-III and anti-tunicate(t) GnRH, but with variation of labeling intensity by each anti-GnRH type. lGnRH-III-ir was detected in numerous type 1 neurosecretory cells (NS1) throughout the cerebral and pleuropedal ganglia, whereas tGnRH-I-ir was detected in only a few NS1 cells in the dorsal region of cerebral and pleuropedal ganglia. In addition, a small number of type 2 neurosecretory cells (NS2) in cerebral ganglion showed lGnRH-III-ir. Long nerve fibers in the neuropil of ventral regions of the cerebral and pluropedal ganglia showed strong tGnRH-I-ir. In the ovary, lGnRH-III-ir was found primarily in oogonia and stage I oocytes, whereas tGnRH-ir was observed in stage I oocytes and some stage II oocytes. These results indicate that GnRH produced in neural ganglia may act in neural signaling. Alternatively, GnRH may also be synthesized locally in the ovary where it could induce oocyte development. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.",10.1016/j.acthis.2009.06.002,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957136467
Krug P.J.; Riffell J.A.; Zimmer R.K.,Endogenous signaling pathways and chemical communication between sperm and egg,2009,Journal of Experimental Biology,212,8,1092,1100,,"Red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) sperm detect a waterborne chemical cue released by conspecific eggs, and change their swimming behavior to increase the likelihood of fertilization success. Previously, we isolated the natural sperm attractant by bioassay-guided fractionation and high-performance liquid chromatography, and chemically identified it as the free-amino acid ltryptophan (L-Trp). In the present study, levels of this ecologically meaningful compound were quantified in various abalone tissues, and in freshly spawned eggs. Tryptophan was the least abundant of 19 dissolved free amino acids (DFAAs) in ovary, testis, foot muscle, gill, stomach and hemolymph. As a proportion of the DFAA pool, however, Trp concentrations were significantly elevated in eggs (three- to seven-times higher) relative to all other sampled tissues. Natural rates of Trp release from eggs also were measured and correlated with fertility. Fertilization success peaked during an initial 30min period (post-spawn), but decreased to nil over the next 50min. Closely paralleling these events, Trp accumulated in seawater around freshly spawned eggs for the first 45min (post-spawn) before decaying rapidly from solution. Older eggs stopped releasing Trp approximately when they became infertile, revealing a critical link between gamete physiology and chemical signaling. This apparent negative feedback loop did not arise from tryptophan oxidation, uptake by bacteria in seawater, or a degrading enzyme released by eggs. As a metabolic precursor critical to development of the larval nervous system, Trp could be an honest indicator of egg fitness for prospective sperm suitors. Our results suggest that endogenous signaling pathways have been co-opted for external communication between gametes, as an adaptation to increase reproductive success by promoting sperm navigation towards fertile eggs.",10.1242/jeb.027029,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-63849154067

Most abalone actively fed on these diets, but there were large variations in the growth rate among the diets and among the growth stages of abalone. Growth rates of abalone fed on Nitzschia sp. were highly variable within each growth stage, but showed no clear differences among growth stages. In contrast, in abalone fed gametophytes or juvenile sporophytes, growth rates linearly increased as abalone grew. Growth rates of >60 μm SL/day were observed in juveniles of >3 mm SL fed gametophytes, and juveniles of >5 mm SL fed juvenile sporophytes. These results indicate that the dietary value of the juvenile stages of E. bicyclis for the abalone changes as they grow, and with growth juvenile abalone begin to efficiently utilize gametophytes and juvenile sporophytes in that order. © 2010 The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.",10.1007/s12562-010-0250-6,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954427419

The three populations were collected from Qingdao (Q) and Dalian (D) in China, and Miyagi (M) in Japan. We measured the shell length, shell width, and total weight. The magnitude of the general combining ability (GCA) variance was more pronounced than the specific combining ability (SCA) variance, which is evidenced by both the ratio of the genetic component in total variation and the GCA/SCA values. The component variances of GCA and SCA were significant for all three traits (P< 0.05), indicating the importance of additive and non-additive genetic effects in determining the expression of these traits. The reciprocal maternal effects (RE) were also significant for these traits (P< 0.05). Our results suggest that population D was the best general combiner in breeding programs to improve growth traits.

Ab1 treatment,2010,Aquaculture,305,1-Apr,59,65,,"This study demonstrated that host-derived Pediococcus sp. Ab1, a potential probiotic, can colonize the gut of abalone (Haliotis gigantea) for 12 days from cessation of feeding with Ab1-supplemented commercial diet. The effective colonization by Ab1 of H. gigantea fed a supplemented diet led to the alteration of microbial populations, increased in situ alginate lyase activity, and increased volatile short chain fatty acids (VSCFAs) production in the abalone gut. Vibrio halioticoli clade dominated the gut microflora of abalone fed an Ab1-supplemented diet, while other Vibrio species were dominant in the abalone fed an unsupplemented commercial diet alone. The same species of bacteria were found in the gut of abalone fed diet with and without supplementation; however, the representation of the V. halioticoli clade was much higher in the gut of abalone fed the Ab1-supplemented diet compared to the gut of abalone fed the unsupplemented commercial diet. The alginate lyase activity and production of formate, a VSCFA, were also higher in the gut of abalone fed the Ab1-supplemented diet compared to the gut of abalone fed unsupplemented commercial diet. These results indicate that the host-derived Pediococcus sp.

Consequently, it is becoming increasingly important to characterise the abalone immune system in order to better understand their ability to combat infection. This study reports the identification and characterisation of a perforin-like protein, designated hmMpeg1, which is believed to be involved in the H. midae immune system. hmMpeg1 encodes for a 78 kDa protein that has significant sequence similarity to Mpeg proteins from other abalone species and includes the conserved cytolytic membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain of perforin. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis demonstrated expression of hmMpeg1 mRNA in haemocytes and epipodia samples from H. midae exposed to a heat-killed, Gram-negative bacterial pathogen, Vibrio anguillarum 5676. hmMpeg1 mRNA in haemocytes increased significantly 48 h post-infection (h.p.i) (8.2 fold; P < 0.05), coinciding with a decrease in the total number of circulating haemocytes, and reached a maximum at 96 h.p.i (17.2 fold; P < 0.05). Similarly, a significant increase in the level of hmMpeg1 mRNA occurred at 24 h.p.i in epipodia samples (3.8 fold; P < 0.05), reaching a maximum at 48 h.p.i (4.5 fold; P < 0.05). In addition, western blot analysis detected a significant increase in hmMpeg1 between 24 h.p.i (4.2 fold; P < 0.05) and 48 h.p.i (3.1 fold; P < 0.05) in the epipodia, and between 48 h.p.i (1.7 fold; P < 0.05) and 96 h.p.i (1.9 fold; P < 0.05) in haemocytes, sampled from abalone exposed to the abalone pathogen V. anguillarum 5676.

At the blastula stage, the normal embryonic development of H. diversicolor supertexta showed a good dose-response decrease when exposed to DMP, DEP, DBP, BBP, and DnHP. 9-h EC50 values of DMP, DEP, DBP, BBP, and DnHP were 55.71, 39.13, 8.37, 2.65, and 3.32 mg/l, respectively. 9-h EC 50 values of DEHP and DOP were not available due to their low solubility. The toxicity order of seven tested PAEs was BBP>DnHP>DBP> DEP>DMP>DOP>DEHP. With the completion of metamorphosis as an experimental endpoint, the 96-h no-observed effect concentration values of DBP, DEHP and the other five tested PAEs were 0.022, 0.021, and 0.020 mg/l, respectively. Due to simple obtainment, convenient stimulation to spawn in the lab, greater sensitivity than mature species, and short culture time, the embryos of H. diversicolor supertexta have the potential to be utilized in acute toxicity test for at least PAEs. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",10.1007/s10646-008-0283-0,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61349096605
De Zoysa M.; Jung S.; Lee J.,First molluscan TNF-α homologue of the TNF superfamily in disk abalone: Molecular characterization and expression analysis,2009,Fish and Shellfish Immunology,26,4,625,631,,"Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) is considered as a multifunctional immune modulator that plays an important role in the innate and adaptive immune systems in vertebrates. Here, we described the characterization and expression analysis of the first TNF-α homologue in mollusk abalone, named as AbTNF-α. It has 930-bp full length with a 717-bp open reading frame (ORF), encoding 239 amino acids. The AbTNF-α amino acid sequence shows the characteristic TNF family signature, N-terminal transmembrane domain consisting of a hydrophobic amino acid cluster and cell attachment sequence at 155RGD157. Phylogenic analysis results showed that AbTNF-α is more related to the invertebrate Ciona savignyi TNF superfamily ligand member (CsTL). Quantitative real-time PCR expression results showed that AbTNF-α was constitutively expressed in both immune and non-immune tissues in a tissue specific manner. The highest constitutive expression was in the gill tissue with a 1.5-fold compared to hemocytes expression. The AbTNF-α mRNA expression in gill tissue was monitored in vivo stimulated by a mixture of pathogenic bacteria (Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahemolyticus, and Lysteria monocytogenes), viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The AbTNF-α expression was significantly (p < 0.05) induced by bacteria, VHSV and LPS compared to the control animals. Moreover, the highest level expressions of each induction were at 24 h (5.2-fold), 48 h (2.8-fold), and 48 h (3.3-fold) by bacteria mixture, VHSV and LPS, respectively. These results indicate that AbTNF-α could respond to pathogenic infection or stimulation and may play an important role in the abalone immune system. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a molluscan IRAK-4 gene, saIRAK-4, was cloned for the first time from the small abalone (Haliotis diversicolor). Its full-length cDNA sequence was 2062 bp, with a 1548 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 516 aa. The molecular mass of the deduced protein was approximately 57.8 kDa with an estimated pI of 5.23, and showed highest identity (47%) to acorn worm Saccoglossus kowalevskii. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed saIRAK-4 shares conserved signature motifs with other IRAK-4 proteins, including the death domain (DD), serine/threonine/tyrosine protein kinase domain (STYKc), protein kinases ATP-binding region signature, serine/threonine protein kinases active-site signature and prokaryotic membrane lipoprotein lipid attachment site. Quantitative real-time PCR was employed to investigate the tissue distribution of saIRAK-4 mRNA, and its expression in abalone under bacteria challenge and larvae at different developmental stages. The saIRAK-4 mRNA could be detected in all examined tissues, with the highest expression level in gills, and was up-regulated in hemocytes and gills after bacteria injection. Additionally, saIRAK-4 was constitutively expressed at all examined developmental stages. These results indicate that saIRAK-4 could respond to pathogenic infection and may play an important role in the adult abalone immune system and early innate immunity in the process of abalone larval development. © 2011.",10.1016/j.fsi.2011.02.018,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953323818

The survival, growth (shell length and body weight), condition index (body weight/shell length), and feed utilization were measured. Survival was excellent (100%) in all groups. Growth rate (body weight) was highest in the abalone fed kelp exclusively, followed by the mixed diet of kelp and G. lemaneiformis. The abalone fed S. pallidum had the lowest increase in body weight and the lowest feed intake. The mixed diet of kelp and G. lemaneiformis yielded the biggest increase in shell length. There were no significant differences in the condition index among all the treatment groups.

Vosloo D.; Vosloo A.,"Response of cold-acclimated, farmed South African abalone (Haliotis midae) to short-term and long-term changes in temperature",2010,Journal of Thermal Biology,35,7,317,323,,"In its natural environment, the South African abalone, Haliotis midae, occurs at average monthly water temperatures between 12 and 21 °C. In the present study we aimed to describe selected physiological and molecular responses of winter acclimated, cultured H. midae after acute and chronic exposure to 16, 19 and 22 °C. During acute (24 h) exposure to 16, 19 and 22 °C we found a significant increase in specific rates of oxygen consumption and nitrogen excretion with higher temperature. This corresponded with a higher reliance on proteins to fuel metabolism and coincided with high d-lactate levels at the 16 °C and high levels of Hsp70 proteins at all three temperatures. After chronic (1 month) exposure to 16, 19 and 22 °C animals compensated for changes in temperature by decreasing their specific oxygen consumption and nitrogen excretion rates with increase in temperature, showing that the animals had a high level of reliance on carbohydrates as food source at 22 °C. d-lactate levels were lower than after acute exposure and Hsp70 protein levels were lower at 16 and 19 °C, but remained high at 22 °C. Total muscle protein levels were lower in 16 and 19 °C animals and very high at 22 °C, indicating that animals incorporate proteins into their tissue, because they do not rely on protein catabolism to the same extent compared to lower temperatures. We conclude that cold acclimated H. midae have the ability to adapt to high temperatures, within their optimal range for growth, provided that they are exposed to sustained stable temperatures and do not experience short, high temperature spikes. These findings will aid in a better understanding of feed utilization and growth patterns of H. midae in the thermally variable intensive mariculture environment. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.jtherbio.2010.06.006,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956717024

By combining field studies with epidemiologic tools, we evaluated the relationship between key factors impeding southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) population growth: disease and resource limitation. This threatened population has struggled to recover despite protection, so we followed radio-tagged sea otters and evaluated infection with 2 disease-causing protozoal pathogens, Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis neurona, to reveal risks that increased the likelihood of pathogen exposure. We identified patterns of pathogen infection that are linked to individual animal behavior, prey choice, and habitat use. We detected a high-risk spatial cluster of S. neurona infections in otters with home ranges in southern Monterey Bay and a coastal segment near San Simeon and Cambria where otters had high levels of infection with T. gondii. We found that otters feeding on abalone, which is the preferred prey in a resource-abundant marine ecosystem, had a very low risk of infection with either pathogen, whereas otters consuming small marine snails were more likely to be infected with T. gondii. Individual dietary specialization in sea otters is an adaptive mechanism for coping with limited food resources along central coastal California. High levels of infection with protozoal pathogens may be an adverse consequence of dietary specialization in this threatened species, with both depleted resources and disease working synergistically to limit recovery. © 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",10.1073/pnas.0806449106,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-60549097039

With limited vision, abalone primarily sense their world chemically, and pheromones may play an important role in settlement, attraction, recognition, alarm, and reproduction. Despite this, there has been no detailed investigation into pheromone substances, both in their precise biochemical nature or pheromonal function. In this study, we investigated the presence of pheromonelike substances from the hypobranchial gland of the abalone Haliotis asinina using bioassays, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The hypobranchial gland of many prosobranchial marine molluscs has been classified as a sex auxiliary gland releasing unknown substances during spawning. In our study, cephalic tentacle assays demonstrated that the cell extracts of the hypobranchial gland contain chemical cues that are sensed by conspecifics. An antibody against the sea slug ""attractin"" pheromone was used as a probe to localize a similar protein in the mucin-secreting cells of the epithelial lining the hypobranchial gland of both male and female abalone. The approximate molecular weight of this abalone attractin-like protein is 30 kDa in both males and females. Fractionation of hypobranchial gland extracts by C5 RP-HPLC could not selectively purify this protein, and no sex-specific differences were observed. We predict that the attractin-like protein could be one of a number of important proteins involved in maturation, aggregation, and/or spawning behavior of abalone. In future research, additional hypobranchial gland components will be tested further for these types of behavior.",10.2983/035.029.0321,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78449298735

The cephalic, epipodial and mantle tentacles bear papillae with ciliary tufts at their tips. Chemoreceptors with 14-21 ciliated cells were found at high density on the snout. When the tentacles were touched with a bamboo rodor a piece of plastic sheet, the abalone contracted the tentacle stimulated, indicating mechanoreception. The contact of a piece of brown algae Laminaria japonica to any of three tentacles elicited a typical feeding response: shell lifting, pedal sole expansion and lifting, and food seizing with pedal sole. The response disappeared when the algae was separated from the tentacles, indicating that the ciliated cells were contact chemoreceptors as well as mechanoreceptors. A possibility of distant chemoreception was examined in a Y-maze in which seawater flowed over the algae and was directed towards the abalone. The algal stimulant triggered the food searching movement of the abalone which randomly chose both the stimulant containing water from the algal containing side and the control water without stimulant. This implies the possession of distant chemoreception possibly by the osphradium, but the abalone lacks a function to detect the origin of the smell.",10.2331/suisan.76.185,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952905243

The full length of HdhGPx cDNA was 963 bp with a 669 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 222 amino acids and a 101 bp eukaryotic selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) in 3′ untranslated region (UTR). It was showed that HdhGPx has a characteristic codon at 235TGA237 that corresponds to selenocysteine (SeC) as U72. Sequence characterization revealed that HdhGPx contains a characteristic GPx signature motif 2 (96LGLPCNQF103), an active site motif (179WNFEKF184). In addition, two potential N-glycosylation sites (112NGTE115 and 132NLTQ135) were identified in HdhGPx. 3D modeling analysis showed that the overall structure of HdhGPx monomer had more similarity to human GPx3 than human GPx1. Relatively higher-level mRNA expression was detected in hepatopancreas, mantle and gonad by real-time PCR assays. The relative expression levels of HdhGPx mRNA in hepatopancreas and haemocytes were detected by real-time PCR in abalone fed with nine different diets containing graded levels of selenium (0.15, 1.32 and 48.7 mg kg- 1), zinc (6.69, 33.85 and 710.63 mg kg- 1) and iron (29.17, 65.7 and 1267.2 mg kg- 1) for 20 weeks, respectively. The results showed that the expressions of HdhGPx mRNA were statistically higher at adequate dietary selenium (1.32 mg kg- 1), zinc (33.85 mg kg- 1) and iron (65.7 mg kg- 1) than those in low dietary minerals, respectively. But HdhGPx mRNA expression levels were down-regulated by high contents of dietary selenium (48.7 mg kg- 1), zinc (710.63 mg kg- 1) and iron (1267.2 mg kg- 1), respectively. These results indicated that adequate dietary minerals could increase the mRNA expression of HdhGPx, and then to increase the total antioxidant capacities in abalone. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Its capacity to capture the toxic cellular iron in excess in a compact and safe manner, gives to this protein a key role in detoxification and iron storage. It has a main role in cellular homeostasis and in cellular defense against oxidative stress produced by the reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this research, the cDNA coding sequence of ferritin for Red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) was obtained, which had an open reading frame (ORF) of 516 bp. The deduced amino acid sequence was consisted of 171 residues with a calculated molecular weight of 19.77 kDa. In addition, tissue expression profiles of ferritin in Red abalone were induced by thermal stress showed an expression peak from 16 °C to 22 °C.

In this study, we describe a novel transcription factor activator protein-1 (Ap-1) gene from disk abalone Haliotis discus discus (AbAp-1) for the first time in mollusk. It was identified by homology screening of an abalone normalized cDNA library. The cloned AbAp-1 consists of a 945 bp coding region that encodes a putative protein containing 315 amino acids. The AbAp-1 gene is composed of a characteristic Jun transcription factor domain and a highly conserved basic leucine zipper (bZIP) signature similar to known Ap-1 genes. The AbAp-1 shares 46, 43 and, 40% amino acid identities with fish (Takifugu rubripes), human and insect (Ixodes scapularis) Ap-1, respectively.Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis confirmed that AbAp-1 gene expression is constitutive in all selected tissues. AbAp-1 was upregulated in gills after bacteria (Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahemolyticus and Lysteria monocytogenes) challenge; and, upregulated in hemocytes and gills by viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) challenge. Shell damage and tissue injury also increased the transcriptional level of Ap-1 in mantle together with other transcription factors (NF-kB, LITAF) and pro-inflammatory TNF-α. All results considered, identification and gene expression data demonstrate that abalone Ap-1 is an important regulator in innate immune response against bacteria and virus, as well as in the inflammatory response during tissue injury. In addition, stimulation of Ap-1 under different external stimuli could be useful to understand the Ap-1 biology and its downstream target genes, especially in abalone-like mollusks. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.fsi.2010.08.014,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957751881

During the experiment, a pre-determined amount of seaweed (Gracilaria verrucosa) was added to feed the animals once every 2-3 d. Water quality measurements were taken weekly and the mortality rate of abalone was observed in the morning. In the first experiment, four stocking densities (40,60,80, and 100 pieces/cage) with ten replicates were used. After six months, growth in terms of shell length and total weight of abalone at 60 pes/cage were the highest with values of 35.5 ± 2.8 mm, and 13.5 ± 3.3 g, respectively. The survival rate (78.2%) at this stocking density was also the highest. The stocking density of 60 pes/cage was chosen for the second experiment, where abalone of three initial size ranges (4-5, 7-8, and 10-11 mm) in shell length were investigated in the same manner as the first experiment. It was found that abalone with an initial size range of 10-11 mm showed the best survival rate (82%) compared with 4-5 mm (46.2%) and 7-8 mm (64.8%).

Given the unique features of the COE gene, its proposed ancestral role in the specification of chemosensory neurons and the wealth of functional data from vertebrates and Drosophila, the evolutionary history of the COE gene can be readily investigated. We have examined the ways in which COE expression has diversified among the Metazoa by analysing its expression from representatives of four disparate invertebrate phyla: Ctenophora (Mnemiopsis leidyi); Mollusca (Haliotis asinina); Annelida (Capitella teleta and Chaetopterus) and Echinodermata (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus). In addition, we have studied COE function with knockdown experiments in S. purpuratus, which indicate that COE is likely to be involved in repressing serotonergic cell fate in the apical ganglion of dipleurula larvae. These analyses suggest that COE has played an important role in the evolution of ectodermally derived tissues (likely primarily nervous tissues) and mesodermally derived tissues. Our results provide a broad evolutionary foundation from which further studies aimed at the functional characterisation and evolution of COE can be investigated. © The Author(s) 2010.",10.1007/s00427-010-0343-3,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651339941

The potential of this new commercial crop is analysed. Material is collected from natural free-floating populations and at least four species are commonly grown, with different ecophysiological characteristics. A brown epiphyte, Myrionema strangulans, causes a disease of the Ulva, which is currently managed by farmers by re-stocking. The main potential threat is that some farmers are wary of integrated systems, fearing they may promote disease in abalone, although Ulva has been grown in abalone effluent and fed back to the abalone on one farm for 6years without adverse effects. Opportunities exist for the expansion of Ulva cultivation via further spread of the abalone industry, the inclusion of seaweed raceways in proposed fish-farming activities, or the potential for the inclusion of high quality cultivated Ulva as a constituent in aquafeed. A conservative estimate of production over a full year from these raceway systems was 26.1g dw m-2 day-1 (2006) and 19.7g dw m-2 day-1 (2007), similar to maximum figures for total annual microalgal biomass production in outdoor systems. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2008.",10.1007/s10811-008-9385-6,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350385204

Hatchery-reared Haliotis rubra larvae and juveniles were successfully batch-tagged with distinct and persistent marks, enabling unambiguous differentiation from wild conspecifics when recaptured. Larvae were batch-tagged with the epifluorescent dye calcein. Experiments demonstrated that the batch-tagged larval shell was clearly visible in the spire of juvenile shells after 260 days. The recapture of batch-tagged and released larvae from natural reefs after 533 days at liberty also confirmed the persistence of this tag. A reliable and cost-effective method for batch-tagging juveniles was achieved with the use of an artificial diet that resulted in a distinctive blue-green coloration of the shell. This coloration differentiated released juveniles from wild conspecifics, was easily observed with the naked eye, and persisted on the spire of individuals for 777 days at liberty.

Increasing feed ration by 20% boosted biomass by significantly increasing abalone growth during the first 3 months by 4%, but was less effective as the animals grew. Growth, mortality and food conversion ratios were optimized in tanks with a low density and a low feed ration, but economic gains were dominated by the increased biomass return from tanks with a higher stocking density. It is thought that reduced dissolved oxygen and differing access to food contributed to the patterns observed. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1365-2109.2009.02250.x,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-69949148101

In the present study, it was further observed that long-term chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of BaP modulated the immunocompetence of abalones in terms of the change in activity of the antioxidant and immune associated parameters tested. In addition, the effect of tributyltin (TBT), another important genotoxicant in the aquatic environment, was investigated. Exposure of abalones to sublethal concentrations of TBT and BaP for 21 days resulted in significant decrease of total hemocyte count, phagocytosis, membrane stability and lysozyme activity. Conversely induction of extra and intra cellular superoxide generation, nitric oxide, nitric oxide synthase and myeloperoxidase activity was present when the abalones were exposed to TBT and BaP. Most of the immune associated parameters tested showed clear time dependent response to both toxicants. Within 14 days after the 21 day exposure to BaP, recovery was observed as evidenced by most of the parameters returning to their normal level. However, no recovery was observed within 14 days after the 21 day exposure to TBT as evidenced by continued elevation of intra cellular superoxide and nitrite production and decrease in THC, membrane stability and lysozyme activity. This suggested a prolonged TBT-induced impact on the immune reaction and possibly more damage than that caused by BaP. Overall the results suggest that chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of TBT or BaP causes modulations in the immunocompetence of abalones with most of the immune associated parameters tested being stimulated, and this might be harmful to the host. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The different diets were provided to groups of 20 abalone during 120 days in independent triplicates. Though no significant differences in growth (P < 0.05) were registered among all formulated diets, a tendency to accumulate different fatty acids in muscle was observed. The proximate composition of abalone tissue showed that the diet containing 6.8% HUFA resulted in higher lipid accumulation in muscle tissue than that observed in the other treatments. Our results suggest that H. tuberculata coccinea, contrary to to abalone species from colder environments, does not have high HUFA requirements; however, the fatty acid profile of muscle and viscera tissues of abalone may be modulated by the fatty acid content in diets.",10.7773/cm.v35i1.1442,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-65749102615

The objective of this work was to compare the growth rate and survival of red abalone cultured in two systems. Flow through (daily water exchange rate of 800%) and recirculating systems consisted of a 250 L fibreglass tank and constant aeration, but biofiltration in the recirculating system was provided with a 28 L (1 ft3) bubble-washed bead filter. Water variables were measured either daily (dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH and salinity) or three times a week (total ammonia nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen and alkalinity). Shell length was measured every 2 weeks for 18 weeks. Only the alkalinity and pH were significantly different due to the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the recirculating system. Abalone growth rate was 26.1 ± 15.96 μm day-1 in the recirculating systems and 22.21 ± 18.69 μm day-1 in the flow-through systems. The final survival was 78.74% in the recirculating systems and 71.82% in the flow-through systems. Significant differences in the final size and survival of the abalones were found between systems (P<0.05). Therefore, recirculating aquaculture systems is a feasible alternative for juvenile red abalone culture. © 2010 CICESE.

Strain E.M.A.; Johnson C.R.,"Competition between an invasive urchin and commercially fished abalone: Effect on body condition, reproduction and survivorship",2009,Marine Ecology Progress Series,377,,169,182,,"Incursion of the urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii into Tasmania, Australia, and its establishment at high densities raises questions about its potential interactions with another large herbivore on subtidal rocky reefs, the commercially fished abalone Haliotis rubra. Surveys on the southeast coast of Australia show a negative relationship between densities of C. rodgersii and H. rubra at several spatial scales, suggesting negative interactions. In intact algal beds, we used enclosures to estimate the effects and relative magnitude of intra- and interspecific competition on the body condition, gonad development and survival of C. rodgersii and H. rubra. An increased density of conspecifics led to declines in the dry gonad weight of C. rodgersii and in the dry foot and stomach content weights of H. rubra. The effects of interspecific competition were asymmetrical. Manipulations of H. rubra densities had no detectable effect on C. rodgersii. In contrast, in enclosures with added C. rodgersii, H. rubra showed reduced total and dry weights of stomach contents and increased mortality relative to controls without urchins. The effects of C. rodgersii on H. rubra could be linked to differences in feeding habits and morphology. C. rodgersii is a generalist herbivore, which, even at low densities, reduced the cover and standing biomass of total, brown and red algae relative to controls without urchins. In contrast, H. rubra is a specialist herbivore, which, even at high densities, had little effect on the cover and standing biomass of algae relative to the effect of C. rodgersii. This study suggests that the invader C. rodgersii is the superior competitor in interactions with H. rubra, and that its presence, even at low densities, affects the abalone fishery. © Inter-Research 2009.",10.3354/meps07816,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-62149135843
Garcia-Esquivel Z.; Felbeck H.,"Comparative performance of juvenile red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, reared in laboratory with fresh kelp and balanced diets",2009,Aquaculture Nutrition,15,2,209,217,,"Juvenile Haliotis rufescens were reared in the laboratory in order to investigate the extent to which fresh kelp and formulated feeds with 250 g kg-1 (25P) and 380 g kg-1 protein content (38P) affected their growth rate, gut residence time (GRT), food consumption (C), food conversion ratio (FCR) and digestibility. Abalone from 38P attained the highest growth rate (70.5 ± 4.2 μm day-1; 98.3 ± 6.95 μg day-1), followed by 25P (47.9 ± 2.79 μm day-1; 67.4 ± 2.82 μg day-1) and kelp (23.6 ± 3.36 μm day-1; 28.2 ± 4.11 μg day-1). No significant differences were observed in consumption rate among treatments (0.61-0.68% body weight per day), yet kelp-fed abalone exhibited higher FCR (2.44), protein efficiency ratio (4.42), and apparent digestibility of dry matter (69.5%), protein (69.8%) and gross energy (79.2%) than 38P organisms (59.8, 62.4 and 62.2%, respectively). They also showed longer GRT (23.1 ± 0.93 h). This study demonstrated that formulated diets with 250 g kg-1 and 380 g kg-1 protein inclusion can sustain higher growth rates of juvenile H. rufescens than fresh algae. These differences seem to be due to the amount of dietary protein. Kelp meal appears to improve the consumption and digestibility of balanced diets, and its inclusion in formulated diets is recommended. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1365-2095.2008.00585.x,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-61849085909

A semiclosed recirculating land-based system was used with stocking densities of 368, 735, and 1,100 individuals/m2. Each stocking density had 3 replicates. An artificial diet, modified from a shrimp commercial diet, was used throughout this experiment. In July 2008, initial sizes of abalone (mean shell length (SL) ± SE) were not statistically different, with values of 1.28 ± 0.0062, 1.28 ± 0.0131, and 1.30 ± 0.0339 cm for 368, 735, and 1,100 individuals/m2, respectively (P > 0.05). After 8 mo, SLs were significantly different, with values of 3.63 ± 0.092, 3.25 ± 0.1173, and 3.05 ± 0.0985 cm for the 3 stocking densities. As the stocking density increased, mean specific growth rates, measured by the percent increase in SL during the 8-mo period, decreased, with values (mean ± SD) of 1.97 ± 0.0495, 1.66 ± 0.1595, and 1.53 ± 0.0544. The mean specific growth rate of the density 368 individuals/m2 was significantly different from 735 individuals/m2 and 1,100 individuals/m2. The variations of specific growth rate, calculated in term of the coefficient of variation (mean ± SD) were increased with increasing stocking densities: 20.16 ± 0.251, 22.17 ± 3.146, and 23.66 ± 0.886. The difference was significant only between the 368 individuals/m2 and the 1,100 individuals/m2. The best-fit linear equations between the natural logarithm of specific growth rate and initial size of abalone for 3 stocking densities were estimated. These equations demonstrated that specific growth rates of the larger size abalone decreased at higher rates than that of the smaller size as the stocking density increased. This demonstrated a nonrandom effect of stocking density on abalone size. This also implied that grading of large abalone should be done regularly. Allometric equations between shell width (SW) and SL as well as between total weight (TW) and SL were calculated: SW = 0.6531 SL0.777 (r2 = 0.721) and TW = 0.3276 SL 2.720 (r2 = 0.823), respectively. Throughout this 8-mo experiment, survival rates of abalone were not significantly different, with values of 95.1 ± 5.05, 92.9 ± 6.19, and 95.7 ± 0.513 at stocking densities of 368, 735, and 1,100 individuals/m2, respectively.",10.2983/035.029.0307,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78449278936

This study investigated whether the negative impact of high stocking density in shallow raceway tanks could be ameliorated by optimizing water flow. We quantified the effect of flow rate (87-246 L min-1) on the performance of 2-year-old hybrid abalone (Haliotis laevigata and Haliotis rubra) held at two stocking densities (11400 and 7600 tank-1). A 50% higher density yielded a 27% increase in biomass gain, despite a 10% growth reduction and 3% higher mortality. At the lower density, there was an optimal flow rate of approximately 200 L-1, at which biomass gain was 474 kg and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was 1.31. At the higher density, biomass gain (max = 658 kg) and FCR (min = 1.41) improved linearly with increasing flow, suggesting that an optimal flow rate exists at 246 L-1 or beyond those tested. Increased oxygen availability with increasing flow is thought to have enhanced abalone performance, although flows greater than 200 L min-1 may have reduced performance at low density due to feed washout and nutrient leaching. Overall, greater financial return per tank was favoured by the combination of high stocking density and high water flow. © 2009 The Authors.

Wu L.; Wu X.; Deng H.; Huang Y.,First identification and functional analysis of a histidine triad nucleotide binding protein in an invertebrate species Haliotis diversicolor supertexta,2010,Developmental and Comparative Immunology,34,1,76,83,,"Histidine triad nucleotide binding protein (HINT) represents the most ancient and widespread branches in the histidine triad superfamily. HINT plays an important role in many biological processes especially in cell biology, and it has been found in a wide variety of species. However, the functional attributes of HINT homologues in invertebrates have not yet been reported. Here we identified a HINT homologue in abalone, which we named ab-HINT. The ab-HINT shows significant structural and functional similarities to mammalian HINT. RT-PCR and western blot analysis show that ab-HINT is ubiquitously expressed in abalone tissues and highly expressed in hemocyte and gills. In addition, significant up-regulation of ab-HINT was observed after LPS or Poly I:C challenge. Immunostainings suggest that ab-HINT is expressed predominantly in epithelial cells and mainly localized in the cytoplasmic compartment. Studies of the effect on cell apoptosis indicate that ab-HINT can trigger hemocytes apoptosis and p53 is involved in this process. These results conclude that ab-HINT is involved in the immune response of abalone and may be a potential pro-apoptotic factor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first identification and characterization of a HINT homologue in invertebrates. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (13C and 15N) were tested to detect nutritional sources during the early life stages of the abalone Haliotis discus hannai in laboratory experiments to evaluate stable isotope analyses as an appropriate investigative tool for field studies. Fertilized eggs, larvae, and the parent spawner muscle were analyzed to detect a nutritional source during the nonfeeding period. The 13C of fertilized eggs showed slight depletion, about 2‰, compared with that of the parent muscle, and was not detectable after lipid extraction of fertilized eggs. As for the larvae, the isotopic values in postlarvae after settlement and metamorphosis were 2‰ more enriched, become similar to that of the spawner muscle. These results imply that the lipid portion of the eggs is the primary nutritional source during the nonfeeding period of abalone. Laboratory feeding experiments were conducted during which early postlarval abalone (approximately 1 mm in shell length (SL)) were reared for 7 days and supplied with 4 benthic diatoms respectively. The benthic diatom Cylindrotheca closterium produced high growth and survival rates for early postlarval abalone, and there was a significant isotopic shift in their 13C, approaching that of C. closterium. Larger postlarval abalone (SL, >1.3 mm) were fed 1 of 5 benthic diatoms and a gametophyte of a macroalga, Undaria pinnatifida, for 21 days. Isotopic changes approaching the 13C of the provided benthic diatoms were detected from postlarvae fed the benthic diatoms Achnanthes longipes, Cocconeis scutellum, C. closterium, and the gametophyte of U. pinnatifida, which provided high survival rates and growth rates for the postlarvae. From these results, stable isotope ratios of postlarval abalone are suggested to be useful to infer the origin of the assimilated diets. The current study highlights that stable isotope ratios are a promising tool to investigate the diet composition of postlarval abalone in their natural habitat as well as in abalone hatcheries.",10.2983/035.029.0315,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78449303171

Whether the defense capacity in these seaweeds is generally impaired by low-light stress was also investigated. Aquaria with blackened walls connected to a flow-through water system were used as Experimental Units (EUs). Different light regimes were established using layers of black gauze material and clear perspex lids, mounted on top of the EU. The gauze allowed the stepwise reduction of ambient light. Six different light levels with eight replicates each were realised. The growth rates of algal exposed to different light levels were calculated using a linear regression analysis. Using outdoor mesocosm facilities, three fully-factorial experiments were realised during which low-light stress on different algae-grazer combinations was induced: 1) the red algae Gracilaria edulis with the sea hare Aplysia sp., 2) G. edulis with the abalone Haliotis diversicolor, and 3) Gracilaria salicornia with H. diversicolor. For each combination, 48 aquaria were used, while in a control group of another 48 tanks, algae were kept in the absence of herbivores. Following low-light and feeding-stress induction, herbivore consumption on algal material was assessed in feeding assays with living thalli fragments. Negative effects of light reduction on algal growth rates was observed in both experiments with G. edulis and in one trial with G. salicornia, while general effects of low-light stress on seaweed palatability were absent in our study. By contrast, for some herbivore-algal combinations, significant differences in consumption were detected on previously-grazed and ungrazed algal material, that indicates the presence of an inducible defense. G. edulis and G. salicornia produced defenses when exposed to grazing by the gastropod Aplysia sp. and H. diversicolor, respectively. In contrast, G. edulis showed no response to H. diversicolor. Our findings show that inducible defenses generally exist in the two investigated Gracilaria species, but vary with the identity of herbivores. Surprisingly, algal palatability was not affected throughout all low-light regimes, contrasting the widespread notion that defensive traits in seaweeds are dependent on metabolic energy. Thus, it appears that low-light stress effects play only a minor role on the performance of antiherbivore defenses in these two red algae.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951760311

The results showed that the weight gain ratio (WGR) increased with the dietary LA levels, and reached the highest value in the group with 800mg kg-1 dietary LA supplement. Glutathione peroxidase activity in the 800mg kg-1 dietary LAgroupwas significantly higher than that in the dietary LA-deficient (0mg kg-1) group. Superoxide dismutase activities in the 200,400 and 800mg kg-1 groups were significantly increased. Supplements of 200,400 and 800mg kg-1dietary LAelevated the total antioxidative capacity significantly. The glutathione level in the hepatopancreas increased significantly with the dietary LA supplements in a dose-dependent manner (except for the 200mg kg-1 group). Catalase and malondialdehyde in the hepatopancreas were not significantly affected by dietary LA. In conclusion, dietary LA promoted the growth and stimulated the antioxidative defence capacity of abalone.

Four treatment diets were then investigated: a formulated diet; plantlets from culture Macrocystis pyrifera, Porphyra columbina from natural beds; and a mixed diet consisting of a blend of fresh P. columbina together with the formulated diet. This study was performed in a shallow aquaculture system with a horizontal water flow. After 90 days, significant differences were observed between treatments. The highest growth was obtained with Porphyra (3.3 mm month -1), followed by the mixed diet (2.6 mm month-1), then Macrocystis (2.1 mm month-1) and lastly the formulated diet (1.4 mm month-1). Moreover, after the diets were tested for stability and remnant nutrients after a 12-h water immersion, a positive trend appeared to be related to the protein/energy (P:E). It is concluded that fronds of P. columbina resulted in the best diet for weaning H. rufescens under horizontal water flow systems, even if apparently the water stability of the formulated diet had a negative impact on abalone performance, particularly due to a poor nutrient retention capacity. Therefore, formulated diets should be improved before being recommended for weaning red abalone. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1365-2109.2009.02267.x,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350164326

Six semi-purified diets containing graded levels of dietary copper (1.08, 3.76, 6.54, 14.80, 26.84 and 109.41 mg/kg diet) from CuSO4{dot operator}5H2O were fed to juvenile abalone (initial shell length: 17.21 ± 0.04 mm; initial body weight: 0.65 ± 0.00 g) in triplicate groups for 24 weeks in a flow-through system. The results showed that no significant (P > 0.05) differences were found in weight gain rate (WGR, %), daily increment in shell length (DISL, μm/day) and survival among the dietary treatments. However, Cu concentrations in abalone serum, hepatopancreas, muscle and newly grown shell showed a clear increasing trend with the supplementation of dietary Cu, and the concentrations were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in abalone fed dietary Cu ≥ 26.84 mg/kg compared to those fed 1.08 mg Cu/kg. The crude lipid in abalone carcass decreased with increasing dietary Cu and was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in abalone fed dietary Cu ≥ 26.84 mg/kg compared to the rest of the treatments. The activities of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn SOD) in the hepatopancreas and serum were significantly increased when supplementation of dietary Cu reached 3.76 mg/kg diet, and 6.54 mg/kg diet provided maximum activity of serum phenoloxidase (PO). There was no significant difference for these enzyme activities when dietary Cu was over those values. The optimum requirement of juvenile abalone for dietary Cu was estimated to be 3-5 mg/kg diet by broken-line regression analysis, based on the activities of CuZn SOD and PO either in abalone hepatopancreas or serum. Deficiency of dietary Cu significantly depressed the immune responses in abalone. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Weight-standardized rates (ingestion, assimilation, respiration, ammonia excretion, and fecal excretion) of small (juvenile), medium (mature), and large (mature) sea cucumbers were measured and energy budgets constructed to quantify their growth rates when offered three different diets at 14, 16, and 18C. Three types of diet were offered: uneaten abalone food (diet A) and two types of abalone feces, one where abalone were fed 50% Macrocystis pyrifera and 50% Undaria pinnatifida macroalgae (diet B) and the other where abalone were fed 25% M.pyrifera, 25% U.pinnatifida, and 50% Adam & Amos Abalone Food, where the latter is an industry standard diet (diet C). The organic contents of the diets were much higher than natural sediments and varied such that diet A (76.40%)>diet B (54.50%)>diet C (37.00%). Diet had a significant effect on S.mollis ingestion rates, assimilation efficiencies, and consequently energy budgets and growth rates. Greater quantities of organic matter (OM) from diet A and diet B were ingested and assimilated by the sea cucumbers compared with the OM in diet C. The energy budgets indicated that after taking routine metabolism into account, all sizes of sea cucumbers had energy to allocate to growth when offered diet A and diet B, but only juveniles had energy to allocate to growth when offered diet C. Fecal excretion rates when offered diet A and diet C at 14C were greater than those at 18C, but neither was significantly different from that at 16C. Ammonia excretion rates increased nonlinearly with temperature for small and medium sea cucumbers but not for large sea cucumbers. Weight-standardized respiration rates increased with temperature and unexpectedly with animal size, which may have been because of the narrow weight range of test animals biasing the results. These results suggest that industry standard type abalone waste lacks sufficient energy to meet the metabolic requirements of mature sea cucumbers but that growing juveniles on these wastes appears to be feasible and warrants further investigation. © Copyright by the World Aquaculture Society 2009.",10.1111/j.1749-7345.2009.00239.x,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65449126229

A coastal conifer forest covered highlands of Santa Rosa during the last glacial, but by ca. 11 800-cal. a BP Pinus stands, coastal sage scrub and grassland replaced the forest as the climate warmed. The early Holocene became increasingly drier, particularly after ca. 9150-cal. a BP, as the pond dried frequently, and coastal sage scrub covered the nearby hillslopes. By ca. 6900-cal. a BP grasslands recovered at both sites. Pollen of wetland plants became prominent at Soledad Pond after ca. 4500-cal. a BP, and at Abalone Rocks Marsh after ca. 3465-cal. a BP. Diatoms suggest freshening of the Abalone Rocks Marsh somewhat later, probably by additional runoff from the highlands. Introduction of non-native species by ranchers occurred subsequent to AD 1850. Charcoal influx is high early in the record, but declines during the early Holocene when minimal biomass suggests extended drought. A general increase occurs after ca. 7000-cal. a BP, and especially after ca. 4500-cal. a BP.

Coyne V.E.,The importance of ATP in the immune system of molluscs,2011,Invertebrate Survival Journal,8,1,48,55,,"Molluscs rely on an innate immune system for defence against infection. Invading organisms are phagocytosed by circulating hemocytes and neutralised by a combination of hydrolytic enzymes and the production of reactive oxygen species. Phagocytosis, the central feature of the molluscan innate immune system, is an energy-demanding process as a consequence of actin polymerisation which requires a constant supply of ATP. Adenylate kinase, shown to couple local ATP supply and actomyosin assembly in macrophage cell lines, may play a similar role in molluscan hemocytes. Hemocyte conformational changes and chemotaxis are regulated via protein kinase C which is phosphorylated in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. ATP utilisation in protein kinase cascades is thought to be quite significant. The vast majority of the ATP required to support cellular functions in animal cells is generated via the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Disruption of this process with antimycin A resulted in a 50 % decrease in ATP levels in Haliotis midae hemocytes which also exhibited reduced phagocytic activity. Phosphoarginine and arginine kinase are thought to play a role in invertebrates that is similar to phosphocreatine and creatine kinase in vertebrates, by supplying additional ATP during periods of high energy demand. The energetically-expensive processes associated with the molluscan innate immune system, such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, formation and acidification of the phagolysosome, are severely compromised by abiotic stresses such as elevated water temperature and pollutants, reflecting the fine balance that must be maintained to ensure sufficient ATP is available for both general metabolism and the immune response. © 2011, Universita degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia.

For successful recovery, supplementation may be necessary. To determine appropriate culture methods, juveniles were reared in habitat-enriched tanks (supplemented with rocks, macroalgae and sea urchins) or conventional aquaculture tanks and assessed for growth and survivorship in the laboratory over 15 months. No differences in survivorship or growth were observed. Subsequent experiments examined whether abalone behaviour (habitat selection and movement patterns) differed between rearing treatments. Abalone were exposed to one of three predator treatments (sea star arm, small crab, or no predator (control)) and filmed for 8 h. Abalone from habitat-enriched tanks changed habitats significantly more often than abalone from conventional tanks regardless of predator treatment. Significant differences in the percentage of time that abalone occupied the various habitats were also observed. Abalone in the sea star and control treatments primarily occupied the rocks, whereas abalone in the crab treatment behaved differently depending on the rearing method; conventionally reared abalone spent more time in corners, whereas abalone from habitat-enriched tanks spent more time exposed. These results demonstrate that rearing conditions can affect abalone behaviour and should be considered for abalone restoration efforts worldwide. © CSIRO 2009.",10.1071/MF08262,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71049194388

Dyck M.; Roberts R.; Jeffs A.,Use of algal diets to aid early weaning in the abalone haliotis iris,2010,Journal of Shellfish Research,29,3,613,620,,"A major bottleneck in the aquaculture of abalone is feeding during the nursery stage of production, from larval settlement to approximately 10 mm in shell length (SL). Most commercial abalone nurseries settle larvae onto vertical plastic plates coated in a film of algae that acts as a settlement cue and an important postsettlement food source. As abalone grow, their food consumption increases exponentially, and it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain an adequate supply of algal food. Even grazing-resistant algae, like Ulvella lens, are often depleted when abalone reach 35 mm SL, requiring nurseries to provide additional algae or to wean the juveniles prematurely onto manufactured diets. Early weaning typically results in slower growth and higher mortality relative to live algal feeds. The current study tested various algal species to aid early weaning of the abalone Haliotis iris. Two experiments were conducted pairing nursery tanks of similar environmental conditions to test a total of three algal treatments: (1) the benthic diatom Nitzschia longissima, (2) a film of N. longissima and U. lens, and (3) a film of N. longissima and a naturally occurring mixture of green algal species that remained on weaning tank surfaces after a previous cohort of abalone had been harvested from the tank. Algae were established prior to the introduction of juvenile (SL, 27 mm) H. iris at a density of 15,00030,000 abalone per tank (2.5 m3 water volume, 13 m2 surface area). The abalone were raised to approximately 15 mm SL with twice-weekly supplementary feeding of suspended N. longissima during the first 4 wk, and the addition of manufactured feed 3 times a day for the duration of the experiment. The N. longissima films were completely removed by grazing within 45 days whereas the green algal films persisted for 60120 days. Despite the difference in resilience of algal films, there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in abalone performance between treatments 1 (98.7% survival, growth of 85 m/day) and 2 (98.3% survival, growth of 92 m/day). In a second experiment, treatment 2 provided slightly greater growth than the mixed algal film of treatment 3(101 m/day vs. 96 m/day, P = 0.034), but survival rates were similar (98.2% vs. 98.3%, P = 0.86). All 3 algal treatments offer practical and effective means of weaning H. iris onto manufactured feeds at an SL of more than 3 mm. However, both treatments 1 and 3 can be established more rapidly than U. lens and are therefore likely to be more efficient for commercial weaning of H. iris and potentially for other species of abalone.",10.2983/035.029.0309,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78449281241

In this study, the cDNA of selenium-binding protein from abalone Haliotis discus hannai Ino (HdhSEBP) was cloned by homology cloning and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique. The full length of HdhSEBP cDNA was 2071bp, consisting of a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 55bp, a 3' UTR of 522bp, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 1494bp. The deduced protein has 497 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 55.6kDa and a predicted isoelectric point of 5.47. BLAST analysis reveals that HdhSEBP shares high identities with other known SEBPs from mammal, bird, fish and mollusk, etc. The mRNA expression patterns of HdhSEBP in hepatopancreas and haemocytes were measured by real-time PCR in abalone fed with nine different diets containing graded levels of selenium (0, 1 and 50mgKg-1), iron (0, 65 and 1300mgKg-1) and zinc (0, 35 and 700mgKg-1) for 20 weeks, respectively. The results showed that the expression of the HdhSEBP mRNA increased and reached the maximum at optimal dietary selenium (1mgKg-1), iron (65mgKg-1) and zinc (35 mg Kg-1), respectively. Deficient or excessive level of dietary selenium, iron or zinc, respectively, leaded to significant depression of HdhSEBP mRNA. It is concluded that the expression levels of HdhSEBP are affected by dietary selenium, iron or zinc. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.fsi.2010.02.028,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955053483
Voultsiadou Eleni E.,Therapeutic properties and uses of marine invertebrates in the ancient Greek world and early Byzantium,2010,Journal of Ethnopharmacology,130,2,237,247,,"Aim of the study: Marine organisms are currently investigated for the therapeutic potential of their natural products with very promising results. The human interest for their use in healing practices in the Eastern Mediterranean goes back to the antiquity. An attempt is made in the present work to investigate the therapeutic properties of marine invertebrates and the ways they were used in the medical practice during the dawn of the western medicine. Methods: The classical Greek texts of the Ancient Greek (Classical, Hellenistic and Roman) and early Byzantine period were studied and the data collected were analysed in order to extract detailed information on the parts of animal bodies and the ways they were used for healing purposes. Results and discussion: Thirty-eight marine invertebrates were recorded for their therapeutic properties and uses in 40 works of 20 classical authors, covering a time period of 11 centuries (5th c. BC to 7th c. AD). The identified taxa were classified into 7 phyla and 11 classes of the animal kingdom, while molluscs were the dominant group. Marine invertebrates were more frequently used for their properties relevant to digestive, genitourinary and skin disorders. Flesh, broth, skeleton, or other special body parts of the animals were prepared as drinks, collyria, suppositories, cataplasms, compresses, etc. Conclusions: Marine invertebrates were well known for their therapeutic properties and had a prominent role in the medical practice during the Ancient Greek and the early Byzantine period. The diversity of animal species and their medicinal uses reflect the maritime nature of the Greek civilization, which flourished on the coasts and islands of the Aegean Sea. Most of them were common species exploited by humans for food or other everyday uses. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",10.1016/j.jep.2010.04.041,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954952443

The aim of this study was the understanding of a possible role of the p38 MAPK in abalone haemocyte responses towards this bacterium. First, the pathogenicity of different V. harveyi strains was compared in both immersion and injection trials, and clear differences were detected. The three strains, ORM4, 04/092, and 05/053, all isolated from moribund abalone, induced up to 80% mortalities in immersion or injection challenges (LD50 (ORM4) - 2.5 x 102 CFUanimal-1). The two strains, LMG 4044T and LMG 7890 were non-pathogenic towards abalone in immersion trials, and needed very high numbers for killing by intramuscular injections (LD50 - 8.9 x 10 4 and 1.6 x 105 CFUanimal-1, respectively). To start unraveling the mechanism explaining these differences, the p38-MAPK, a keyplayer in antimicrobial immune response, was studied. The non-pathogenic strain, LMG 7890 can be eliminated by abalone haemocytes and induces haemocyte phagocytosis and high ROS production. With different concentrations of ap38-specific inhibitor, SB203580, p38 implication was shown. This inhibitor reduced phagocytosis and ROS induction leading to LMG 7890 proliferation. In the case ofthe pathogenic ORM4 which can not be eliminated by abalone haemocytes, no phagocytosis and ROS production was induced, and a retarded p38 activation was observed. Taken together, our results suggest that p38 MAPK modulation may be one of the ways of virulent V. harveyi to attack its host and escape abalone immune response. J. Cell.

First, a pebble coated with crustose coralline algae (CCA) was used to induce competent H. diversicolor larvae to metamorphose at 2, 5, 8, 12, or 17 days (Group A) or 2, 6, 10, or 12 days (Group B) after fertilization. To observe spontaneous attachment and metamorphosis, some larvae from Group B were maintained without the addition of a CCA-coated pebble. Rapid metamorphosis was observed in older larvae of both CCA-induced groups; 2 days after the addition of the CCA-coated pebble, 50-75% of the 2-day-old larvae and more than 85% of the 5-12-day-old larvae had metamorphosed. The percentage of spontaneously metamorphosed individuals increased 14 days after fertilization, reaching 50.6 ± 16.7% (mean ± S.E.) at 18 days. Second, metamorphosed post-larvae that had experienced larval periods of 5, 8, 11, or 15 days (Group A) or 4, 7, or 10 days (Group B) were reared at 26 °C with or without the benthic diatom Nitzchia ovalis as the sole food source. The survival and growth rates of the fed post-larvae in both groups decreased with the length of the larval swimming period; of the post-larvae from larvae of more than 7-11 days old, fewer than 70% still survived 16 days after metamorphosis. Mean growth rates during the 6 days after metamorphosis were lowest for the post-larvae from the larvae with the longest period of swimming. Third, newly settled post-larvae from 2-day-old larvae were reared at 26 °C with delays of 0, 3, 6, 9, or 12 days before first feeding (N. ovalis). Feeding delays of longer than 6 days dramatically depressed post-larval survival rates; approximately 1 week after the onset of feeding, more than 65% and fewer than 20% of the larvae subjected to feeding delays of 0-3 days or 6-12 days, respectively, still survived. These results indicate that H. diversicolor is more susceptible to the detrimental effects of delayed metamorphosis and delayed post-settlement feeding than are the larger abalone species Haliotis discus hannai and Haliotis iris. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It is hypothesised that spirulina algae, which are high in protein, may be a suitable feed ingredient for weaning abalone. Over a period of 27 days, the growth and survival of juvenile (4-6 mm shell length) Haliotis midae were compared when weaned from diatoms onto agar-bound, 48% protein diets with either spirulina, fishmeal, or fishmeal and spirulina as the sources of nutrition. Agar-gel alone was used as a control (0% protein) and a commercial abalone diet, Abfeed®-S34 (34% protein), was included as a reference. Abalone that were fed fishmeal and spirulina combined performed best in both weight and shell-length gain (36.87 ± 2.19 mg and 2.29 ± 0.05 mm). The growth of agar-fed control animals was worst of all treatments (1.26 ± 2.03 mg and 0.19 ± 0.14 mm) and had a markedly reduced survival rate (18.6 ± 5.5%). Growth in abalone that were fed the spirulina only (9.41 ± 3.39 mg and 0.58 ± 0.27 mm) was better than the control-fed abalone and was substantially lower than other diet treatments, but not significantly different from them. Abalone that were fed Abfeed®-S34 only had a significantly higher condition factor (0.91 ± 0.02) compared with those fed the control (0.70 ± 0.09) and the combined diet (0.75 ± 0.01), and a significantly higher soft-body tissue to shell mass ratio (2.38 ± 0.14) than those fed spirulina only (1.67 ± 0.15) or the control (1.05 ± 0.09). Agar was a suitable medium for binding and presenting dietary ingredients to abalone at weaning, and fishmeal or a fishmeal-spirulina combination provided sufficient protein and energy for good growth and survival. Spirulina as a single-ingredient feed is not recommended. © NISC (Pty) Ltd.",10.2989/AJMS.2009.31.1.10.781,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049518751

Here we report a new variant of the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai that displays a novel orange shell coloration (O-type) that is clearly distinguishable from the wild green-shelled abalone (G-type). Controlled mating experiments between O- and G-type abalones demonstrated apparent Mendelian segregations (1:1 or 3:1) in shell colors in F 2 families, which support the notion that the O- and G-types are under strict genetic control at a single locus with a recessive o (for orange shell) allele and a dominant G (for green shell) allele. Feeding with different diets caused modifications of shell color within each genotype, ranging from orange to yellow for O-type and green to dark-brown for the G-type, without affecting the distinction between genotypes. A previously described bluish-purple (B-type) shell color was found in one of the putative oo × oG crosses, suggesting that the B-type may be a recessive allele belonging to the same locus.

In this report we show that injections of APGW-amide into 4-mo-old juvenile Haliotis asinina stimulate growth of body weight and, to a lesser degree, shell length. The injections were given at 0 (control), 20, and 200 ng/g body weight (BW), at 1-wk intervals for 14 wk. BW and shell length (SL) were measured every week, and growth rates were calculated. When compared with control animals, there was an approximate 2-fold increase in body growth rates of animals given 20 ng/g BW and 200 ng/g BW APGW-amide (P ≤ 0.05), whereas only 20 ng/g BW APGW-amide produced significantly greater SL than controls (P ≤ 0.05), with an approximate 1.2-fold increase. Using an immunoperoxidase technique, we showed the presence of APGW-amide in neuronal cells of the cerebral ganglia and nerve fibers. Overall, these data indicate that APGW-amide is an important neurohormone/neuromodulator in the nervous system of H. asinina and plays a role in controlling the body growth of H. asinina. .",10.2983/035.029.0329,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78449306522
De Zoysa M.; Nikapitiya C.; Whang I.; Lee J.-S.; Lee J.,Abhisin: A potential antimicrobial peptide derived from histone H2A of disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus),2009,Fish and Shellfish Immunology,27,5,639,646,,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play an important role in the immune defense against pathogenic microorganisms. In this study, a histone H2A full-length cDNA was cloned from disk abalone Haliotis discus discus. We identified a 40-amino acid AMP designated as abhisin from the N-terminus of the abalone histone H2A sequence. Abhisin shows the characteristic features of AMPs including net positive charge (+13), higher hydrophobic residues (27%) and 2.82 kcal/mol protein binding potential. Abhisin shares 80% amino acid identity with the buforin I peptide that is derived from Asian toad histone H2A. We synthesized the synthetic peptide of abhisin, and characterized its antimicrobial activities. Our results showed the growth inhibition of Gram positive (G+) Listeria monocytogenes, Gram negative (G-) Vibrio ichthyoenteri bacteria, and fungi (yeast) Pityrosporum ovale by abhisin treatment at 250 μg/mL. However, stronger activity was displayed against the G+ than G- bacteria. Additionally, scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation results confirmed that P. ovale cells were damaged by abhisin treatment. Interestingly, abhisin treatment (50 μg/mL) decreased the viability of THP-1 leukemia cancer cells approximately by 25% but there was no effect on the normal vero cells, suggesting that abhisin has cytotoxicity against cancer cells but not normal cells. Quantitative real time RT-PCR results revealed that histone H2A transcription was significantly induced at 3 h post-infection with bacteria in abalone gills and digestive tract. These results suggest that abhisin is a potential antimicrobial agent, and its precursor histone H2A may be involved in the innate immune defense system in abalone. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The mice were intraperitoneally injected with the extracts from the midgut glands of cultured scallops Patinopecten yessoensis gathered in early spring in Funka Bay, Hokkaido, Japan. The injections induced atypical symptoms in the mice within 24 h. The symptoms included piloerection, substantial eye discharge, swelling of the ears and head, and ear scratching. They were similar to those reported in studies of photosensitivity caused by pyropheophorbide in the midgut glands of abalones, which are herbivorous gastropods. The problematic scallops also accumulated a large amount of pyropheophorbide-a. The amount determined with high-performance liquid chromatography was 300-530 μg per 1 g of the homogenate of the midgut glands. The dose of pyropheophorbide sufficient to cause photosensitivity in a mouse is estimated to be 0.99-2.3 mg per mouse with 20-g body weight. Moreover, comparative tests in mice showed that the onset of the symptoms required light and a substantial amount of pyropheophorbide. Therefore, we determined that the observed symptoms were photosensitivity caused by pyropheophorbide. Scallops, which are suspension-feeding bivalves, can accumulate a large amount of pyropheophorbide in the midgut glands depending on the habitat environment. © 2010 The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.",10.1007/s12562-010-0233-7,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951974650
Hellyer R.,Poor but not pirates: The Tsushima domain and foreign relations in early modern Japan,2010,"Elusive Pirates, Pervasive Smugglers: Violence and Clandestine Trade in the Greater China Seas",,,115,126,,"Over the past few decades, historians have demonstrated that, during the Edo period (1603-1868), Japan pursued foreign relations policies very much in tune with its Asian neighbors. For one, Arano Yasunori has illustrated how Japanese leaders restricted overseas trade and the movement of foreign merchants, took measures to stamp out Christianity, and established diplomatic protocols in ways that mirrored those of their counterparts throughout East and Southeast Asia.1 Despite these similarities, by the early nineteenth century, Japan had in one respect become exceptional in Asia and, for that matter, in the world. It was free of maritime pirates, namely, individuals or groups who use violence or the threat of violence to commandeer shipping or to attack coastal settlements. In the decades after 1800, pirates infested the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, and, as explored in other chapters in this volume, the coast of China to the Gulf of Tonkin, as well as the waters around Singapore. One would assume that maritime piracy would also have plagued Japan, a state with few coastal defenses and no navy. Yet, as I have noted elsewhere, official documents rarely mention piracy.2 A report of an incident in Japan's Inland Sea in 1870, for example, provides the only direct reference to pirates in Japanese waters in the ""Dai Nihon Ishin Shiryō Kōhon,"" the most comprehensive collection of central and local government records chronicling events from 1846 to 1872, the unsettled period surrounding the Meiji Restoration of 1868.3 Others, such as Tsukō ichiran zokushu, a five-volume compilation of all types of Japanese intercourse with foreigners in the first decades of the nineteenth century, also register no attacks by pirates in the nineteenth century on either coastal settlements or shipping.4 The absence of piracy is intriguing particularly given the long history of such activity in Japanese waters spanning the period from the fourteenth to the late sixteenth centuries. As the chapters by Peter Shapinsky and Maria Grazia Petrucci show, sea-based, marginal groups used violence as one tool to carve out political and economic power and authority in the Inland Sea. In addition, James Chin highlights the important role that Japanese merchants played in sixteenth-century transnational trading networks headed by Chinese who engaged in piracy and smuggling simultaneously. He notes that some of these ""merchant-pirates,"" based in Kyushu, developed ties with, among others, traders-cum-pirates from Satsuma, a feudal domain in the southern part of the island. In the seventeenth century, however, Satsuma turned away from piracy. Like other Japanese coastal provinces, Satsuma did not return to it, even as political turmoil and increased trade in the first half of the nineteenth century created an environment where pirates conceivably could have prospered (see Map 9.1). As I have argued elsewhere, Satsuma, instead, chose smuggling, establishing a broad network of domestic and overseas partners extending in the south from Ryukyu (present-day Okinawa prefecture), an island kingdom dominated by Satsuma during the Edo period, to Ezo (present-day Hokkaido), then the northern frontier of the Japanese state. Unlike pirates, who use violence to seize goods, smugglers try to circumvent established commercial channels, often with the help of others, thereby engaging in activities that violate state laws or restrictions, in this case, regulations imposed by Japan's central authority, the Tokugawa shogunate (bakufu). At ports on the Japan Sea coast, Satsuma ships illicitly traded Ryukyu sugar and Satsuma goods for marine products, primarily kelp, sea cucumbers, and abalone, harvested in Ezo. In clandestine exchanges with Chinese ships that arrived on domain shores, Satsuma used these products to obtain Chinese and Southeast Asian pharmacopeia, in high demand on the Japanese home market.5 In sum, Satsuma leaders anticipated piracy by reducing the opportunities for individuals to extract goods from coastal shipping and settlements by force. They also incorporated into their burgeoning commercial network domestic and foreign groups that might otherwise have organized fishermen or coastal merchants into pirate bands to raid the Japanese coastline. In a broader sense, the case of Satsuma reveals first, the vigor of a Japanese domestic market that produced a range of goods which buoyed maritime trade. Second, it demonstrates the viability of Japanese- Chinese trade in the early nineteenth century, particularly outside the long established trade center of Nagasaki in Kyushu.6 This chapter explores further the absence of piracy in late Edo period Japan by considering the situation of the Tsushima domain, a feudal fief on the island of the same name located in the straits between Kyushu and Korea. Tsushima provides, in many ways, an even more interesting case study. First, because of the domain's history: from the early fourteenth to the mid-sixteenth century, the island served, at varying levels of intensity, as a base for pirate bands which attacked especially the Korean coast (only fifty kilometers away, half the distance to the nearest Kyushu port of Hakata). Second, owing to its key role in smoothing relations between the shogunate and the Korean court, Tsushima enjoyed a high level of agency - the ability to exercise discretionary authority in trade, diplomacy, and defense - which offered a potential platform to facilitate piracy. Third, beginning in the second half of the eighteenth century, Tsushima leaders faced a crippled domain economy resulting chiefly from a decline in trade revenues, but also from poor agricultural production. This dire economic situation conceivably could have prompted Tsushima leaders to resort to piracy. Finally, they had numerous opportunities to undertake piracy in league with the Western merchants whose ships increasingly visited its shores after 1846. Yet, despite all of these potential reasons, Tsushima leaders and the island's denizens did not choose the path of piracy. As this chapter outlines below, the domain's established relationships with Korea and the shogunate, particularly the financial grants offered by both authorities, made a move to piracy less appealing. Moreover, domain officials viewed the Westerners calling at its harbors more as possible enemies than as potential partners for piratical schemes. Indeed, as the visits of Western ships multiplied, domain leaders sought to abrogate the agency Tsushima enjoyed in relations with Korea and, instead, to enhance its place within the larger defensive system of the Japanese realm. Overall, Tsushima leaders aimed to incorporate their territory more into existing Japanese state structures than to chart an independent course in defense and trade. © 2010 by Hong Kong University Press, HKU.

Nacre is intensely studied because its biologically controlled microarchitecture gives rise to remarkable strength and toughness, but the mechanisms leading to its formation are not well understood. Here we present synchrotron spectromicroscopy experiments revealing that stacks of aragonite tablet crystals in nacre are misoriented with respect to each other. Quantitative measurements of crystal orientation, tablet size, and tablet stacking direction show that orientational ordering occurs not abruptly but gradually over a distance of 50 μm. Several lines of evidence indicate that different crystal orientations imply different tablet growth rates during nacre formation. A theoretical model based on kinetic and gradual selection of the fastest growth rates produces results in qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental data and therefore demonstrates that ordering in nacre is a result of crystal growth kinetics and competition either in addition or to the exclusion of templation by acidic proteins as previously assumed. As in other natural evolving kinetic systems, selection of the fastest-growing stacks of tablets occurs gradually in space and time. These results suggest that the self-ordering of the mineral phase, which may occur completely independently of biological or organic-molecule control, is fundamental in nacre formation.© 2008 American Chemical Society.",10.1021/ja8065495,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-67749093249

The growth and feeding rates of abalones were inhibited during the early stage of exposure to different extents, but then recovered to nearly the control levels. A large portion of Ag was redistributed to organelles and metal-rich granules from the cellular debris fraction, whereas cellular debris and metallothionein-like protein were the dominant pools for the storage of Cd, which remained comparable during the exposure period. The MT concentrations were significantly elevated (in a dose-dependent manner) within the first 2 weeks of exposure, after which the MT concentrations started to decrease. All these results implied that abalones respond rapidly to metal exposure, but apparently developed subsequent acclimation. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2010.05.018,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956184780
Amos F.F.; Evans J.S.,"AP7, a partially disordered pseudo C-RING protein, is capable of forming stabilized aragonite in vitro",2009,Biochemistry,48,6,1332,1339,,"AP7 is an extracellular aragonite-associated protein of the nacre layer of the mollusk Haliotis rufescens and possesses a 36-amino acid C-terminal domain that exhibits sequence homology to the C subclass of the RING domain intracellular protein family. We report here novel findings which implicate AP7 as a member of the intrinsically disordered protein class (IDP) and reveal new aspects of AP7 mineralization activity. AP7 is partially disordered but can undergo additional folding in the presence of TFE. AP7 binds Zn(II) ions in a non-tetracoordinate complex but does not require Zn(II) either for folding or for in vitro function. In addition to limiting calcite crystal growth, AP7 is also observed to induce aggregate formation within in vitro mineralization assays, and these aggregates are either amorphous (type A) or crystalline (type B) in appearance. The type A aggregate displays an irregular morphology and round, dark, electron dense deposits that do not give rise to a diffraction pattern. In contrast, the type B aggregates possess either organized parallel crystal clusters or highly dense hexagonal clusters that are confirmed by electron diffraction to be aragonite. This stabilization of aragonite is remarkable in that it occurred in the presence of AP7 alone and did not require typical aragonite stabilization agents such as Mg(II), other nacre proteins, or an organized organic matrix. The ability of a partially disordered C-RING protein to perform inorganic phase stabilization represents a new twist on both the RING domain and IDP stories, and this process of aggregate formation may provide an important clue with regard to the protein-mediated nacre formation process. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",10.1021/bi802148r,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-64349106349

However, strong inferences about these processes can be drawn from other molluscs. For example, ganglia from the gastropods Aplysia and Lymnaea are known to produce neuropeptides related to growth, feeding behavior, and reproduction. Here, we use suppression subtractive hybridization to identify expressed genes that may be linked to the control of growth and feeding in the tropical abalone Haliotis asinina. Two pools of suppression subtractive hybridization clones were obtained from messenger RNA derived from H. asinina cerebral and pleuropedal ganglia, corresponding to genes differentially expressed in (1) well-nourished animals relative to food-deprived ones and (2) well-nourished animals relative to reproductively active ones. From these subtractions, respectively, 204 and 214 unigenes were identified in 222 and 231 sequenced clones, with 18 of these unigenes common to both subtractions. A subset of the putative differentially expressed genes was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, validating this approach. The transcripts that are differentially expressed in the ganglia of growing H. asinina fall into a wide range of functional categories, including biological regulation, cell proliferation, and metabolic process, and include genes encoding Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2 (or, FMRF-amide), myomodulin, CDC123, RAB37, and dermatopontin.",10.2983/035.029.0328,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78449282685

It however has been suffering Vibrio alginolyticus infections, which cause mass death of small abalone and thus great economic losses, particularly in artificial aquaculture. In this study, we attempted to treat small abalone with anti-Vibrio IgY to elicit a passive immunity directly against V. alginolyticus infections. Anti-Vibrio IgY was alginate encapsulated in egg powders as feed, which may avoid antibody inactivation in the gastrointestinal tract of small abalone. The feed was tested for the stability of anti-Vibrio IgY in a gastrointestinal mimic environment. The result showed anti-Vibrio IgY retained activity as high as 90% after 4 h exposure to pancreatic enzymes. Addition of 0, 5 or 10% anti-Vibrio IgY-encapsulated egg powders into a basal diet to form abalone diet formulae. Small abalones fed with the anti-Vibrio IgY formulae showed a relatively high respiratory burst activity than those without anti-Vibrio IgY treatments. The survival rates of small abalones fed with 5 or 10% anti-Vibrio IgY egg powders were in the range of 65-70% 14 days post-V. alginolyticus challenge (1 × 106 c.f.u.), which was significantly higher than 0% of those fed without anti-Vibrio IgY. The anti-Vibrio IgY-encapsulated formulae were thus concluded to be an effective means to prevent small abalone from V. alginolyticus infection, and may be practical in use in abalone aquaculture. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.fsi.2011.01.026,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953296825

Based on the results, a new, simple, non-destructive method to calculate the relative utilization efficiencies (RUE) of nutrients is presented to estimate the relative contributions of a nutrient to growth, body maintenance and the excess used for energy. Calculations of RUE of protein estimated that at the maximum growth rate, 59% of the CP was responsible for growth, while 31% was used for body maintenance and an excess of 10% was lost and presumably catabolized for energy and carbohydrate anabolism.

BLAST analysis revealed that HdhHSP90 shared high similarity with other known HSP90s, and the five conserved amino acid blocks defined as HSP90 protein family signatures were also identified in HdhHSP90, which indicated that HdhHSP90 should be a cytosolic member of the HSP90 family.

The results showed that the expression levels of HdhHSP90 transcript were significantly up-regulated and reached the maximum (0.47-fold) in hepatopancreas of Pacific abalone fed with optimal dietary Se (1.32 mg Kg-1) (p < 0.05).

The antioxidant enzymes include Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), catalase (CAT), mu-glutathione-s-transferase (mu-GST) and thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx). The results showed that the mRNA expression of these antioxidant enzymes increased and reached the maximum at the dietary zinc level of 33.8 mg/kg, and then dropped progressively. Expression levels of the heat shock proteins (HSP26, HSP70 and HSP90) firstly increased at 33.8 mg/kg dietary Zn level, and reached to the maximum at 710.6 mg/kg, then dropped at 3462.5 mg/kg (p < 0.05). Excessive dietary Zn (710.6 and 3462.5 mg/kg) significantly increases the Zn content and significantly decreases the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in hepatopancreas (p < 0.05). These findings showed that dietary Zn (33.8 mg/kg) could highly trigger the expression levels of antioxidant enzymes and heat shock proteins, but excessive dietary Zn (710.6 and 3462.5 mg/kg) induces a high oxidative stress in abalone. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.cbpc.2011.03.003,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955465581

Mayfield S.,Enhancing fishery assessments for an Australian abalone fishery using commercial weight-grade data,2010,Fisheries Research,105,1,28,37,,"Effective management of commercial fisheries is dependent on the reliability of fishery assessments that, in turn, are determined by the quantity and quality of the available data. Data on the length-structure of the catch provide important information on exploited stocks, but representative sub-sampling is difficult to achieve, especially where numerous licence holders fish over large areas. This study evaluates the potential for routinely collected, commercial, weight-grade data to overcome this challenge and enhance assessment of the Western Zone blacklip (Haliotis rubra) and greenlip (Haliotis laevigata) abalone fisheries in South Australia. Current weight-grade data for blacklip abalone are inaccurate. However, the accuracy, rigour and consistency of the data for greenlip abalone confirm they are sufficiently reliable for aiding fishery assessments on this species. The greenlip abalone data were highly representative of the catch and the fishery and have been obtained in a consistent manner for >20 years. Changes in the composition of the grades in the catch provide a meaningful measure of change in the harvested stock. Similarly, measures of mean weight and number harvested, derived from the weight-grade data, are valuable as additional indices of stock status. These attributes substantially enhance the credibility of these data for use in assessing changes in stock status through time, and suggest these data should be used to supplement current assessments of this species. The value of the weight-grade data would increase substantially if the resolution was improved by using automated weighing and grading systems. The analysis of weight-grade data, routinely collected from numerous fisheries, is likely to benefit their assessment. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.fishres.2010.02.007,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955577080

The morphological features of blood cells were described according to the observations made by light microscopy of Wright-Giemsa-stained blood films. The reference intervals and the mean value were determined for each hematological parameter evaluated in healthy fish and data were compared to those of naturally infected, with dactylogyrid monogeneans fish.Infected fish showed a prevalence of 100% and a mean intensity of 246.6 parasites per fish. Mean values of HCT, WBC, thrombocytes percentage and eosinophils percentage were significantly higher (P< 0.05) in the infected fish. In addition, lymphocytes percentage and total protein were significantly lower (P< 0.05) in the infected fish compared to healthy fish. Only total WBC count, lymphocytes percentage and eosinophils percentage in infected fish were outside reference interval. The hematology of the spotted rose snapper of this study might serve as a basis for future studies and diagnosis. Changes observed in blood parameters in infected fish suggest that the immune system of L. guttatus was affected by the presence of the parasites. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.tice.2011.01.002,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051595333

In present study, we provided the initial characterization of SOCS-2 homologue from the mollusk abalone Haliotis discus discus as a member of invertebrate SOCS-2. The disk abalone SOCS-2 cDNA (AbSOCS-2) contains 1700-bp full length with 771-bp coding sequence, which codes 257 amino acids protein. Based on the sequence analysis results, AbSOCS-2 showed characteristic SH2 domain and SOCS box similar to vertebrate SOCS counterparts. Additionally, 3′ UTR of the AbSOCS-2 contained two RNA instability motifs (ATTTA). Quantitative real-time PCR expression results showed that AbSOCS-2 was constitutively expressed in all examined tissues of healthy abalone showing tissue specific variation. AbSOCS-2 mRNA expression was induced significantly (p < 0.05) by bacteria mixture containing Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahemolyticus, and Listeria monocytogenes in abalone gill at 3 h post-induction (p.i.). Furthermore, AbSOC-2 mRNA was significantly (p < 0.05) induced by viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatments in abalone gill. Therefore, discovery and expression analysis of abalone SOCS-2 gene would provide evolutional relationship of SOCS family members and immune defense responses against bacteria, virus and LPS like immune modulators. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A better antibacterial activity against nine selected pathogen bacteria was recorded in twig essential oil, and the selected pathogens of both Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were sensitive to the leaf and twig essential oils in the present study. No antibacterial activity was recorded in the hot-water extracts of leaf and twig. In challenge trial, a significant decrease of sensitivity to V. alginolyticus (1 × 106 cfu shrimp-1) was found in that of shrimp received hot-water extract from twig at the levels of 2 μg g shrimp-1 compared to control. In addition, the how-water extract of twig in vitro showed greater enhanced effects on phenoloxidase activity, respiratory burst and phagocytosis of white shrimp compared to the hot-water extract of leaf.

Experiments were conducted to investigate the optimal conditions for artificial seed production and mass cultivation of this species. Seedlings of E. stolonifera were reared in an indoor tank for 60 days until they were around 500 μm in length. Following indoor tank culture, the seedlings were transferred in situ to a nursery culture area for 2 months, before begin transferred to the main grow-out area. The maximum growth and development of young thalli in nursery culture area occurred at 2 m depth, whilst maximum growth of thalli in the main culture area occured at 1.5 m depth. Production of E. stolonifera was between 3 and 9 kg wet wt. m-1 in the first year of culture after seeding and 12 to 13 kg wet wt. m-1 in the second year of culture, after management (depth control and fouling organism removal, etc.) of the holdfast. The relationship between optimal water depth for culture and underwater irradiance during the E. stolonifera cultivation was defined as: y = -0.331x + 8.198 (r2 = 0.9903).

Although the nutritional importance of abalone has been reported through in vitro and in vivo studies, there is little evidence about the potential anti-tumor effects of abalone visceral extract. The aim of the present study is to examine anti-tumor efficacy of abalone visceral extract and to elucidate its working mechanism.Methods: In the present study, we used breast cancer model using BALB/c mouse-derived 4T1 mammary carcinoma and investigated the effect of abalone visceral extract on tumor development. Inhibitory effect against tumor metastasis was assessed by histopathology of lungs. Cox-2 productions by primary and secondary tumor were measured by real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting (IB). Proliferation assay based on [3H]-thymidine incorporation and measurement of cytokines and effector molecules by RT-PCR were used to confirm tumor suppression efficacy of abalone visceral extract by modulating cytolytic CD8+ T cells. The cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cell was compared by JAM test.Results: Oral administration of abalone visceral extract reduced tumor growth (tumor volume and weight) and showed reduced metastasis as confirmed by decreased level of splenomegaly (spleen size and weight) and histological analysis of the lung metastasis (gross analysis and histological staining). Reduced expression of Cox-2 (mRNA and protein) from primary tumor and metastasized lung was also detected. In addition, treatment of abalone visceral extract increased anti-tumor activities of CD8+ T cells by increasing the proliferation capacity and their cytolytic activity.Conclusions: Our results suggest that abalone visceral extract has anti-tumor effects by suppressing tumor growth and lung metastasis through decreasing Cox-2 expression level as well as promoting proliferation and cytolytic function of CD8+ T cells. © 2010 Lee et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1472-6882-10-60,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958005853

Morphological variations have long been used by ecologists and evolutionary biologists to identify physiological and/or environmental conditions associated with the growth and health of organisms. Two important factors affecting morphological plasticity are food supply and temperature conditions. Two different experiments were conducted to test the effect of dietary protein (source and amount) and water temperature on shell morphology (length, width, height, thickness and weight) of juvenile abalone (Haliotis iris). In the first experiment, nine different dietary protein sources (white fish and red fish meals, blood meal, meat and bone meal, casein, soybean concentrate, wheat gluten, maize gluten and Spirulina powder) resulted in wider, higher and heavier shells with casein diets and flatter shells with red fish meal. Abalone fed blood meal produced significantly narrower, thinner and lighter shells compared to animals fed the other diets. In the second experiment, six different dietary protein amounts (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 45%) and two temperature regimes (13-21 and 8-16°C) resulted in wider and heavier shells with increasing protein content. However, shell height and thickness were not affected by different protein amounts. Significant differences between temperatures were observed only for shell height and thickness. The results suggest that diet and temperature may be used to manipulate abalone shell morphology in aquaculture environments and they may be potential factors in shell variations of wild populations. © 2011 Academic Journals Inc.",10.3923/jfas.2011.107.118,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955759292

Protein expression profile maybe a good method to help us understand the molecular mechanisms of EDCs-toxicity to aquatic organisms. In this study, the abalone (Haliotis diversicolor supertexta), was selected as the target organism. Toxicological effects of two reference endocrine disruptors: diallyl phthalate (DAP, 50 μg L-1) and bisphenol-A (BPA, 100 μg L-1) were investigated after a three months static-renewal exposure on abalones using proteomics to analyze their hepatopancreas tissues. Some enzyme activity parameters of hepatopancreas extracts were also performed, including Na+-K+-ATPase, Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase, peroxidase (POD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) production. After analyzing the proteomics profile of hepatopancreas by 2D gel electrophoresis, we found that 24 spots significantly increased or decreased at protein expression level (≥2-fold difference) in the 2D-maps from the treatment groups. Eighteen out of 24 protein spots were successfully identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). These proteins can be roughly categorized into diverse functional classes such as detoxification, oxidative stress, hormone regulating, cellular metabolism and innate immunity. In addition, the enzymatic results indicated that DAP/BPA exposure affected the oxidative stress status and the cellular homeostasis, which partly corroborated the proteomics' results. Taken together, these data demonstrate that proteomics is a powerful tool to provide valuable insights into possible mechanisms of toxicity of EDCs contaminants in aquatic species. Additionally, the results highlight the potential of abalone as a valuable candidate for investigating EDCs impacts on marine ecosystems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The nutritional value of four fouling macroalgae (Codium fragile, Sargassum muticum, Ulva pertusa and Laminaria japonica) and one cultured macroalgae (Gracilaria lemaneiformis) as the diet of abalone was assessed by analysis of the chemical composition of the macroalgae and by measuring bioavailability and digestibility to abalone H. discus hannai under laboratory conditions in August 2007. The results showed that the biomass of fouling macroalgae at the two sites was 243.61 ± 26.23 and 1078.15 ± 50.28 g m-1 respectively. The contents of protein of G. lemaneiformis and C. fragile were 18.30% and 17.60%, respectively, which were significantly higher than the others. The five macroalgae were accepted by the abalone, and growth energies (P) and growth efficiency (%) were positive. However, significant differences were found among the different macroalgae. The growth efficiencies of abalone show a negative relationship with the levels of dietary lipid and a positive relationship with the protein contents.

The full length (1,908 bp) abalone cDNA contained a 1,824 bp open reading frame (ORF), encoding 608 amino acids (aa). The predicted molecular mass and isoelectric point were 65 kDa and 4.5, respectively. The C-terminal region showed conserved catalytic site regions, with the catalytic site residues responsible for the endoglucanase activity. RT-PCR results revealed greater hdEndgI mRNA expression in the hepatopancreas than in the digestive tract, suggesting the key site at which the enzyme is produced. hdEndgI mRNA expression decreased from baseline to the 8th week of starvation in the hepatopancreas; and once re-feeding was initiated, mRNA transcription increased to normal levels within 14 days. This suggests that gene transcription is not totally disturbed due to starvation-induced stress, showing the potential of hdEndgI as a molecular tool for identification of food availability. It further suggests that abalone can survive for 8 weeks without food. The purified hdEndgI recombinant fusion protein was shown to have in vitro activity against carboxymethylcellulose.

Intracellular superoxide anion generation and phenoloxidase significantly increased on exposure to B(a)P, whereas phagocytic activity was decreased significantly at higher concentration. Significant alterations were found in the uptake of neutral red and the observed alterations of hematological parameters and immune components tested indicated the generation of immunotoxicological effects on abalone due to B(a)P exposure. The results demonstrate a possible relationship between B(a)P and the immunological parameters of abalone studied. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we provide proof from experimental infection that abalone shriveling syndromeassociated virus (AbSV) can cause abalone shriveling syndrome. This malady produces histological necrosis and abnormally modified macromolecules (hemocyanin and ferritin). The AbSV genome is a 34.952-kilobase circular double-stranded DNA, containing putative genes with similarity to bacteriophages, eukaryotic viruses, bacteria and endosymbionts. Of the 28 predicted open reading frames (ORFs), eight ORF-encoded proteins have identifiable functional homologues. The 4 ORF products correspond to a predicted terminase large subunit and an endonuclease in bacteriophage, and both an integrase and an exonuclease from bacteria. The other four proteins are homologous to an endosymbiont-derived helicase, primase, single-stranded binding (SSB) protein, and thymidylate kinase, individually. Additionally, AbSV exhibits a common gene arrangement similar to the majority of bacteriophages. Unique to AbSV, the viral genome also contains genes associated with bacterial outer membrane proteins and may lack the structural protein-encoding ORFs. Genomic characterization of AbSV indicates that it may represent a transitional form of microbial evolution from viruses to bacteria. © 2010 Zhuang et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0013850,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78249289417

Shear tests were conducted on a special fixture with a shear gap of 200 μm, approximately 100 μm narrower than the spacing between mesolayers. The shear strength is found to be 36.9±15.8 MPa with an average maximum shear strain of 0.3. Assuming the majority of failure occurs through tile pull-out and not through tile fracture, the tensile strength can be converted into a shear strength of 50.9 MPa. Three mechanisms of failure at the tile interfaces are discussed: fracture of mineral bridges, toughening due to friction created through nanoasperities, and toughening due to organic glue. An additional mechanism is fracture through individual tiles. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.jmbbm.2009.04.003,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68949207131

H. australis can be readily ripened and spawned, but larval settlement has proved difficult. The current study addressed aspects of larval settlement (i.e., attachment and metamorphosis) in laboratory experiments and small-scale hatchery trials. Competence to metamorphose was first seen weakly in larvae at 8 days old at 14.5°C, but larval metamorphosis rates increased progressively up to at least 12 days of age. In laboratory experiments, larvae showed a dose-dependent response to dissolved -aminobutyric acid (GABA), with settlement peaking at 1 M (57% metamorphosis 4 days after settlement induction) and declining at higher and lower doses. Across a range of cues, metamorphosis was highest on crustose coralline algae (97 ± 4% metamorphosis after 4 days), intermediate on 1 M GABA (55 ± 14%), and low on diatom films (<20%). GABA combined additively with diatom film to give strong metamorphosis (81 ± 6%). Metamorphosis induction by a diatom film was doubled if the film was pregrazed by juvenile H. australis (76% vs. 35%, P < 0.0001), but the grazing effect appeared to be species specific, because pregrazing by Haliotis iris had no effect (41% vs. 35%, P = 0.720). The species-specific response to trail mucus appears to preclude GABA as being the main inducer of metamorphosis in this case. On hatchery plates, settlement on pregrazed biofilms was approximately 4-fold higher when the plates were horizontal rather than vertical (41 % vs. 10% metamorphosis, P = 0.003). Settlement on ungrazed horizontal plates remained low even if those plates had been held in water with adult conspecifics, but without contacting the abalone. We conclude that tanks offering sloped or horizontal surfaces will be more effective than vertical plates for settlement of H. australis, and that pregrazed biofilms and/or GABA are promising settlement cues.",10.2983/035.029.0316,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78449308531

Its fishery, which in the past decades has ranged between 828 (2001) and 24,828 (1980) metric tons per year [SERNAP, 2005. Servicio Nacional de Pesca: Anuarios estadísticos. (http://www.sernap.cl/paginas/publicaciones/anuarios/index_anuario.php)], is based exclusively on the exploitation of wild stocks. So far, there has been limited interest in tackling the biological and technical feasibility of cultivation of C. concholepas. Hence, the knowledge about its early ontogenetic stages (i.e., larval, early postmetamorphic and small juvenile) cultivation is still deficient. In this study we investigated, under laboratory and field conditions, C. concholepas survivorship, growth rates, feeding rates and the onset of sexual reproduction. Competent loco's larvae were collected in the field and metamorphosed in the laboratory to assess growth rates and survivorship during the first six months of postmetamorphic life. Moreover, using small juvenile C. concholepas of ca. 20 mm of peristomal length, collected in the field, we monitored for the body size and live weight traits in laboratory and field rearing conditions. The feeding of the early postmetamorphics and small juveniles was exclusively based in mono diets of the mussel Semimytilus algosus. The rearing of small juveniles was conducted in two consecutive phases, using two specially designed rearing apparatus. The biochemical content of our laboratory cultivated specimens was compared with values obtained from specimens collected in natural habitats. Their rapid growth and good survivorship makes this species suitable for rearing of cocktail-size specimens (50-60 mm) in less than a year. According to the growing rates reported in this study the legal commercial size of C. concholepas: 100 mm of PL would be reached under field and laboratory conditions in 1.65 and 2.64 years respectively. Moreover, it was found that in our rearing conditions C. concholepas reach sexual maturity in less than a year of benthic life. In summary, considering the findings about C. concholepas high growth rates, and low mortalities, we suggest that our rearing methodologies may be scaled up and implemented for the commercial aquaculture of this unique and valuable muricid. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The feeding rate increases slowly in the afternoon, approaching sunset and becomes constant between sunset and midnight. The abalone remain within shaded refuges during the day, and only emerge from them at night. The present study evaluated some effects of varying the photoperiod on a group of these abalone to determine its potential effects on their feeding behavior. Three groups of juvenile abalone with an initial mean length near 14 mm were maintained in raceway cage culture systems with a continuous flow of fresh seawater and abundant food where each group was exposed to different photoperiods. Growth of the abalone in these systems was monitored for a period of 106 days. Treatment A, considered ""natural,"" included 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness. In Treatment B, the abalone were maintained in complete darkness, and Treatment C included four h of light and 20 h of darkness. The results showed that juveniles cultured in total darkness demonstrated some retardation in growth early in the experiment compared with abalone in a natural light regimen, and those with a partial light regimen. After 43 days, the abalone in the partial light regimen reached and surpassed sizes of the abalone maintained in the natural light regimen and in total darkness, although their feeding activity and growth patterns were erratic compared with abalone in the normal light and total darkness regimes. The results of the experiment were inconclusive as to which light regimen was most favorable when considering the growth patterns and comparative mortality rates within the systems.",10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[763:EOTPRO]2.0.CO;2,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34648824704

The open reading frame sequences of Cu/Zn- and Mn-SODs encoded 154 and 226 amino acids, respectively. Multiple sequence alignments using the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that both abalone SODs showed considerable sequence similarities with their orthologues from diverse aerobic organisms, in which the amino acid residues forming metal ligands were highly conserved. All phylogenetic trees for both SOD genes inferred from maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses presented the monophyletic status of Teleostei and Aves/Tetrapoda clades, and recovered relatively close genetic affiliation of H. discus discus with some molluscan species. Expression of both SODs at mRNA levels were highly modulated in various tissues (gill, muscle and hepatopancreas from juveniles, and haemocytes from adults) by experimental exposures to heavy metals (copper, zinc and cadmium) and also by thermal treatments (elevation of temperature). The mRNA levels of both SODs were increased in general during the metal or thermal treatments; however, the transcriptional responses of SOD genes were quite variable depending upon isoforms and tissues based on semi-quantitative and/or real-time RT-PCR assays. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

With this method, Ab-Rel was successfully isolated from abalone haemocytes and the recombinant Ab-Rel protein from an insect cell line. Western blot analysis was performed to verify the effectiveness of this magnetocapture assay. Since only the activated NF-κB can be captured and separated from the whole cell extracts, this method was simultaneously used to detect the NF-κB activity in vivo, as well as the biological activity of the recombinant protein in vitro. In addition, several proteins which might interact with the abalone NF-κB were together isolated, suggesting that the magnetocapture method would be useful for identifying interaction molecules. These results illustrated that the magnetocapture strategy is rapid, reliable and versatile, providing a promising tool for studying Rel\NF-κB protein. © 2006.",10.1016/j.jbiotec.2006.07.025,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-37849186757
Daume S.,The roles of bacteria and micro and macro algae in abalone aquaculture: A review,2006,Journal of Shellfish Research,25,1,151,157,,"Abalone aquaculture is dependent on cultured algae to induce larval settlement and as a food source for the early life stages of abalone until formulated feed or macroalgae such as Macrocystis sp., Porphyra sp. and Ulva sp. are introduced into the growout system. In the natural environment, abalone larvae settle on coralline red algae, which provide one of the strongest and most consistent settlement cues available for abalone larvae. However, propagation of coralline red algae is not practical commercially. Abalone farms in Japan successfully settle abalone larvae (Haliotis discus hannai) on the green alga Ulvella lens. U. lens also proved to be suitable to enhance settlement of cultured southern Australian abalone species (Haliotis laevigata, H. rubra). Most abalone farms in Australia are now growing U. lens for that purpose. U. lens is easy to culture, no specific facilities are needed and the alga can be grown on PVC settlement plates in commercial nursery tanks. However, U. lens has limited value as a feed for young postlarvae. Instead, cultured diatoms can be added after larvae successfully settle and start feeding. Juvenile abalone (>3 mm in shell length) can consume U. lens and grow rapidly on this alga. Diatom cultures and biofilms developing on settlement plates are not axenic and the role of bacteria in early postlarvae feeding is poorly understood. It has been suggested that bacteria may perform metabolic activities in the undeveloped gut of young postlarvae. At later stages of the nursery phase it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain adequate feed on the plates and this is still regarded as a significant bottleneck for the abalone aquaculture industry. Recent investigations have indicated that sporelings of macroalgae like Ulva sp. or diatoms that can provide more biomass may provide a suitable additional food source for juveniles (>3 mm in shell length).",10.2983/0730-8000(2006)25[151:TROBAM]2.0.CO;2,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646685459
Lessard J.; Campbell A.,"Describing northern abalone, Haliotis kamtschatkana, habitat: Focusing rebuilding efforts in British Columbia, Canada",2007,Journal of Shellfish Research,26,3,677,686,,"The northern abalone is listed as threatened under the Canadian Species at Risk Act. Northern abalone occur in a wide range of habitats from fairly sheltered bays to exposed coastlines. However, not all habitats are likely to support high abalone densities with large northern abalone that have high fecundity. Therefore, habitats that can support dense concentrations of large abalone would be better suited for aggregation rebuilding projects. Several experimental rebuilding projects are currently underway; the experimental sites were, in general, selected based on abalone presence and relative abundance. This study attempts to describe abalone habitat suitable for rebuilding efforts by using data from surveys completed at the start of the large decline of abalone densities observed in British Columbia (BC). Several areas were surveyed to determine abalone density on the southeast coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands and the north central mainland coast of BC between 1978 and 1980. Habitat data were recorded after each dive, including substrate types and dominant algae cover and species. Four categories of algal types were analyzed based on height and growih patterns: (1) canopy; (2) underslorey (large bottom cover): (3) turf (short bottom cover); and (4) encrusting. In addition, an index of wave exposure was also calculated for each site surveyed. Northern abalone density was inversely correlated to mean abalone shell lengths. The exposure index was correlated positively to abalone density but negatively to mean shell length. Regression tree classifications successfully separated habitats of high and low abalone densities, but these differed from habitats classified using mean shell length as the response variable. To optimize rebuilding efforts, a compromise between the two classification models, one with density as the response variable and the other with mean shell length, may have to be developed.",10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[677:DNAHKH]2.0.CO;2,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34748911654

Baldwin J.; Elias J.P.; Wells R.M.G.; Donovan D.A.,"Energy metabolism in the tropical abalone, Haliotis asinina Linné: Comparisons with temperate abalone species",2007,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,342,2,213,225,,"The abalone, Haliotis asinina, is a large, highly active tropical abalone that feeds at night on shallow coral reefs where oxygen levels of the water may be low and the animals can be exposed to air. It is capable of more prolonged and rapid exercise than has been reported for temperate abalone. These unusual behaviours raised the question of whether H. asinina possesses enhanced capacities for aerobic or anaerobic metabolism. The blood oxygen transport system of H. asinina resembles that of temperate abalone in terms of a large hemolymph volume, similar hemocyanin concentrations, and in most hemocyanin oxygen binding properties; however, absence of a Root effect appears confined to hemocyanin from H. asinina and may assist oxygen uptake when hemolymph pH falls during exercise or environmental hypoxia. During exposure to air, H. asinina reduces oxygen uptake by at least 20-fold relative to animals at rest in aerated seawater, and there is no significant ATP production from anaerobic glycolysis or phosphagen hydrolysis in the foot or adductor muscles. This slowing of metabolism may contribute to survival at lower water oxygen levels than normally encountered by most temperate abalone. While crawling speeds of H. asinina in water are not exceptionally high, an aerobic expansibility of 5.5-fold at speeds less than 20% of maximum is more than 2.7-fold greater than reported for several temperate abalone. The high aerobic expansibility also supports the enhanced frequency and duration of flipping behaviour without recourse to the additional inputs from anaerobic glycolysis required by other abalone. Metabolic profiles of foot and adductor muscles of H. asinina are similar to those of other abalone. Common features are low activities of enzymes unique to aerobic ATP production, relatively high activities of arginine kinase, tauropine and d-lactate dehydrogenase as the predominant pyruvate reductases, and low intracellular pH buffering capacities. It is concluded that the exceptional abilities of H. asinina for prolonged and rapid exercise are supported by higher rates of aerobic metabolism rather than any enhanced capacity for anaerobic muscle work. It is unexpected, and instructive, that the exceptional aerobic expansibility is not apparent in obvious adjustments of the blood oxygen delivery system or muscle properties associated with aerobic ATP production. The absence of a hemocyanin Root effect, and the extent to which both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism can be reduced may be special features that assist prolonged exercise and survival of H. asinina when environmental oxygen becomes limiting. © 2007.",10.1016/j.jembe.2006.09.005,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33847279793

Arsenic concentrations in E. radiata tissues varied from 40 to 153 μg g-1. Growth stage did not influence arsenic concentrations or arsenic species. E. radiata contained glycerol arsenoriboside (1-8.5%), phosphate arsenoriboside (10-22%) and sulfonate arsenoriboside (73-91%). Arsenic concentrations varied significantly among animal species and between tissues (5-123 Changes in proportions g g-1). Animals contained variable quantities of arsenobetaine (14-83%). Haliotis rubra tissues contained high concentrations of glycerol trimethylarsonioriboside (0.7-22%) and the fish Odax cyanomelas contained large quantities of phosphate arsenoriboside (25-64%) with little arsenobetaine (1.5-15%). Arsenoribosides consumed from macroalgae are substantially converted or differentially accumulated as glycerol and phosphate arsenoribosides in animal tissues. In all animals, phosphate arsenoriboside would appear to be conserved or synthesised de novo. In gastropods, glycerol trimethylarsonioriboside and thio arsenic species are formed in the digestive system. Thus, the intermediate arsenic species that form a plausible pathway for the formation of arsenobetaine from dimethylarsenoribosides are present. © CSIRO 2008.",10.1071/EN07063,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-46249122607

Postlarvae showed active settling and feeding behaviour in all diatom species and in naturally occurring diatoms. Larval settlement rates differed significantly between experimental substrata after 24 h and 48 h. Nitzschia sp. (96.67 %), Hantzschia amphioxys var. leptocephala (95.00 %) and Navicula seminulum (90.00 %) strongly induced larval settlement of H. discus hannai. Postlarvae could feed on benthic diatoms (< 36 μm in shell length) with both weak and strong adhesion on the 4th day after settlement. Greatest growth (shell length) occurred on Nitzschia sp.

The highest growth was observed for postlarvae fed the MIX (51.37 μm day- 1 and 0.578 ± 0.1 mg day- 1), but was not significantly different from the NAV treatments (46.60 ± 3.4 μm day- 1 and 0.550 ± 0.1 mg day- 1). Abalone larvae, which are lecithotrophic organisms, seem to utilize proteins as a preferred energy substrate up to metamorphosis, since the relative lipid content increased from 15 to 30% from days 0 to 10. Thereafter, lipids are rapidly utilized and decreased to a level of 2% of the dry matter in the postlarvae whole soft tissue. Tissue fatty acid analysis indicated a similar trend among treatments, where relative fatty acid levels increased during the endogenous feeding period and started to decrease concomitant with the start of the exogenous feeding. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, reported on abalone tissue showed a similar trend, among treatments. Based on the results reported here, it can be concluded that the type of diatom is an important factor for growth, where a high lipid and low ash content could be important to improve the performance in terms of growth and survival, in combination to stimulate protease activity and therefore better digestibility. Last but not the least important, the use of monoculture with NAV will be of importance when culturing abalone postlarvae.

The population dynamics and reproduction of polydorids infesting abalone Haliotis midae from two farms in South Africa is described using a length-based, age-structured model. Shells were infested mainly by introduced Boccardia proboscidea. Polydora hoplura and Dipolydora capensis were also present but in numbers too few to identify factors influencing infestation. At both farms, B. proboscidea lived for a minimum of 12 months. Growth rate, size at maturity, maximum size, infestation intensity, recruitment, percentage of the population brooding and mortality appear to be affected by abalone feeding regime and water temperature, and these factors need to be considered in controlling infestation. Brooders and recruits were present throughout the year, but increased significantly during mid- to late winter/early spring when water temperature and day length increased. Treatment measures should therefore be implemented throughout the year but with increased effort when water temperature increases.

Baffles were installed in the RAS culture tanks to enlarge the attachment area and clean out solid waste materials automatically by hydraulic force only. The experimental disk abalones, of shell length 24.5 ± 0.5 mm, were cultured at three stocking densities, 700, 1300 and 1910 individuals/m2 bottom area, in triplicate. The abalones were fed with sea mustard, Undaria pinnatifida, once a week. The abalone feed conversion rates and daily growth rates ranged from 24.5 to 25.9 and 0.32 to 0.36%, respectively. Their daily shell increments and survival rates ranged from 67.7 to 78.6 μm/day and 87.6-92.2%, respectively. The growth in weight tended to decrease at a culture density of 1300 individuals/m2 bottom area, while shell increments and survival rates were acceptable at this density. The total power consumption for heating was 1185.4 kW, comprising 30.2% of the total power consumption, while the average water exchange rate was only 2.9% per day. The total ammonia nitrogen stabilized below 0.07 mg/L, after conditioning of the biofilter. The NO2--N, NO3--N and total suspended solid concentrations were also maintained within acceptable ranges for the normal growth of disk abalone. The use of the RAS with these newly designed culture tanks for disk abalone culture produced 1300 individuals/m2 bottom area with a water exchange rate of only 2.9% per day and used about one-tenth of the heat energy of a conventional flow-through system. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, with decreasing catches from the wild some fishermen's group may eventually resort to rearing tokobushi until of marketable size. Growth experiments of tokobushi fed macroalgae in floating net cage and plastic tanks were conducted to evaluate the influence of culture system, macroalgal food, age and water temperature on their culture. In floating net cage, marketable sizes were obtained at the age of 457-822-day old (15-27-month old) with highest growth rate of 2.36% g day-1 and 0.21 mm day-1. One advantage of the plastic tank culture system was that the tokobushi shell remained clean throughout the culture period. Macroalgal food affected the growth rate; Sargassum fusiforme (Setchell)- and Ulva pertusa (Kjellman)-fed tokobushi were better than Meristotheca papulosa (Montagne)-fed. Further, 1-year-old tokobushi had better growth performance and condition index than the 2-year-old cohort, and growth rates were higher at 17°C than at 12°C. These findings should help tokobushi farmers design their mariculture scheme considering both economic and environmental aspects. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1365-2109.2006.01484.x,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646103678

One of these proteins, AP7, has been identified as a participant in nacre (aragonite) formation in the mollusk Haliotis rufescens. However, the role(s) of this protein in aragonite formation is (are) poorly understood, due to the fact that low quantities of this protein are recoverable from the nacre matrix. To overcome this problem, we employed stepwise solid-phase tBOC synthesis to recreate the 66-AA single-chain protein AP7 and utilized this synthetic form for in vitro mineralization studies. We find that the AP7 protein promotes incomplete or interrupted crystal growth and step edge roundening in a concentration-dependent fashion. Using synthetic peptides which represent the 30-AA N-terminal (AP7N) and 36-AA C-terminal (AP7C) subdomains of AP7, we have identified that the mineral modification activity of AP7 is localized to the unstructured, conformationally labile N-terminal subdomain. Interestingly, the 36-AA C-terminal subdomain has no observable direct effect on in vitro calcium carbonate crystal growth; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that AP7C plays an indirect role in AP7 mineralization activity. Qualitative structural studies reveal that AP7, although possessing Zn(II) fingerlike -His-(X) 6-His, -Cys-(X)2-Cys-, and -Cys-(X)4-Cys- motifs within its C-terminal region, does not possess the structural characteristics of known Zn(II) finger polypeptides, as evidenced by the presence of an ordered, α-helical conformation within the C-terminal subdomain of apo-AP7. Given its associative nature with AP24 and the multifunctional capabilities of the 30-AA N-terminal domain, it is likely that the AP7 protein possesses multifunctional capabilities with regard to nacre formation within the mollusk shell. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",10.1021/cg060056q,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33744754424

Hayes B.; Baranski M.; Goddard M.E.; Robinson N.,Optimisation of marker assisted selection for abalone breeding programs,2007,Aquaculture,265,1-Apr,61,69,,"A computer simulation model was used to optimise strategies for marker assisted selection with best linear unbiased prediction (MBLUP) for quantitative traits in a selective breeding program for the southern Australian abalone industry. The simulation model assumed five marker loci associated with genes affecting growth rate explained 50% of the genetic variance for this trait. Use of markers associated with improved disease resistance was also modelled. Parameters and simulation scheme used are described. The simulations accounted for the possibility of early induction of reproductive condition to reduce generation intervals and for selective genotyping. Affects on profitability were calculated using estimates from the industry of income and expenses for a typical farm and accounting for the costs associated with marker testing. While the extra genetic gains from MAS were in the order of 15%, if the cost of genotyping each marker per animal was $10 AUS, then MBLUP for growth was only profitable when 75 progeny per family were genotyped. Early selection (halving the generation interval) was advantageous for MBLUP and BLUP provided the number of progeny per family was greater 5, as the advantage of two generations of selection more than compensated for the decreased accuracy of selection for early growth. However accurate estimates of parameters, such as the genetic correlation between early growth rate and growth and age at first spawning, would need to be obtained before considering implementing this strategy. The advantage of MBLUP was greater for disease resistance than for growth rate. Selective genotyping, which would greatly reduced genotyping costs of implementing MBLUP to improve disease resistance, did not greatly reduce the additional response achieved with marker assisted selection. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The number of positive NS cells, and the intensity of staining in the ganglia, varied and might be related to the stage of ovarian cycle. At any stage, positive cells were most numerous in the pleuropedal, and least numerous in the visceral ganglion. In addition, several cells of the statocyst and associated nerves also exhibited the immunoreactivity. In the ovary, the most intense reactivity was detected in the follicular and granular cells adjacent to mature oocytes, in the trabeculae and the ovarian capsule. The cytoplasm of mature oocytes was also moderately stained. The results indicate that the cerebral, pleuropedal, and visceral ganglia are the main sites of aELH-producing cells.

Royal jelly is widely consumed in Japan, but a few cases of anaphylaxis caused by royal jelly have been reported. We encountered a 26-year-old Japanese woman who developed anaphylaxis after drinking a beverage of crude royal jelly including honey. She had a history of bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis and food allergy (abalone). Prick tests were performed with the beverage of crude royal jelly including honey and with two other beverages including honey. Only the crude royal jelly beverage showed a positive reaction. An oral challenge test with the crude royal jelly beverage was not performed, but a similar test with a beverage including honey caused no symptoms. A positive response to the beverage of crude royal jelly was not observed in normal volunteers. A positive diagnosis of anaphylaxis due to royal jelly was made based on the positive prick test, systemic clinical symptoms and the negative prick tests in healthy volunteers. Moreover, the patient had no symptoms when taking lemon and orange, which were present as essences in the crude royal jelly beverage, and also had no response to honey after anaphylaxis. Increased consumption of royal jelly in health food supplements may increase the incidence of royal jelly-related allergic reactions. Therefore, royal jelly should be considered as a causative allergen in food-induced anaphylaxis. © 2008 Japanese Dermatological Association.",10.1111/j.1346-8138.2008.00448.x,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42449106174

Habitat was mapped by using multibeam sonar survey techniques and categorized by using rugosity and topographic position analysis. Abalone densities were evaluated by using a remotely operated vehicle and video transect methods. The total amount of suitable habitat at these three sites was far greater than that previously estimated.

The diet of female broodstock and the conditioning regimen are likely to influence these parameters. In this study we examine the effect of broodstock diet (three formulated diets differing in levels of the fatty acid, Arachidonic acid [ARA], and a red seaweed diet) and spawning frequency on egg diameter variability both within a batch of eggs spawned from one female and between batches of eggs. Greenlip abalone broodstock were spawned at the beginning of the experiment and again every 16 wks (1131°C days effective accumulative temperature [EAT]) using commercial hatchery practices. The variability of egg diameter within batches spawned from the same female over three consecutive spawning rounds and within diet treatments was determined. Cytoplasm diameter, vitelline layer and jelly coat thickness of unfertilized eggs were also compared between eggs spawned from individual females and between females. In addition, the relationships between broodstock parameters (weight and shell length) and egg diameter were explored. Eggs spawned from females feeding on a red seaweed diet were smaller than eggs from the low ARA treatment. Depending on spawning frequency, broodstock diet can influence the cytoplasm diameter and jelly coat thickness. No relationship between egg diameter and broodstock parameters was found. However, batches spawned from the same female abalone became more variable over time with a shift in size frequency distribution. Results indicate that the variability of egg diameter within a batch changes from female to female and highlights the importance of selecting successful broodstock for conditioning at commercial hatcheries.",10.2983/0730-8000(2006)25[195:IOCDAS]2.0.CO;2,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646698874

Quota holders have initiated research to assess the viability of stock enhancement by release of hatchery-reared seed. Boulder reefs (1 x 2 x 0.5 m) were constructed by placing natural boulders in wire baskets over sand or bedrock. These reefs allowed accurate census of small abalone during short-term experiments (3-4.5 mo.) examining the effects of seed size [5-25 mm shell length (SL)] and density (25-640 m-2 of seafloor) on survival and growth. Survival increased with seed size, but beyond 10 mm the increased survival did not offset the cost of larger seed. Growth and survival of 8-24 mm seed decreased with increasing density, but regressions were nonsignificant (P = 0.06-0.36) because of variability among reefs. Densities as high as 300 m-2 gave good growth and survival (>40%) over 3 mo. on some reefs. Five natural sites were seeded with 2,600-20,000 juveniles (mean 10-11 mm SL, range 6-19 mm) at an average density of 50 m-2 to estimate long-term survival from commercial reseeding. After 17-20 mo, when recovered abalone averaged 47-60 mm SL, survival varied widely among the five sites ranging from 1.7% to 25.1% (average 13.8%). Estimated survival to harvest size of 125 mm SL ranged from 1.3% to 18.6% (average 10.2%) assuming 3 further years of mortality at M = 0.1. The two sites with the lowest survival were affected by substrate movement during storms, highlighting the risk of using exposed locations with boulders small enough to be turned for surveys. Survival to harvest averaged 15.2% across the three sites without significant storm damage. Growth averaged 29.5 mm SL year-1 across the five sites (range 25-33 mm·year -1). A model was used to examine the economic viability of reseeding, assuming that reseeded abalone supplement natural recruits. At a price of NZ$0.32 per 10 mm SL seed, the return on investment was 20% yr -1 at 10% survival to harvest, and 30% yr-1 at 15% survival. These returns compare favorably with opportunity costs of ∼10% yr-1. suggesting that reseeding is likely to be economically viable if sites and habitat are carefully selected.

A TCM-free diet was used as a control. Each diet was fed to three replicate groups of abalone using a randomized design. The results indicated that phagocytic activity was significantly higher in abalone fed 3%, 5% TCM preparation, 1% astragalus or 1% hawthorn (P < 0.05). Respiratory burst activity was significantly higher in abalone fed 1%, 3%, 5% TCM preparation, 1% astragalus or 1% hawthorn (P < 0.05).

Weight gain ratio (WGR), daily increment in shell length (DISL), total haemocyte count (THC), plasma protein concentration, and the activity of acid phosphatase (ACP) were not significantly affected by the TCM preparation (P > 0.05).

In this study, Haliotis midae fed a kelp diet supplemented with Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain C4 exhibited an increased growth rate compared to abalone fed standard kelp feed both under laboratory and farm conditions. The growth rate of antibiotic-treated H. midae was extremely poor in comparison to abalone that had not been treated with antibiotics when fed an unsupplemented kelp diet, reflecting the importance of gastrointestinal microflora in abalone growth. Alginate lyase activity in the H. midae digestive tract was significantly higher in abalone fed kelp supplemented with strain C4 compared to abalone fed unsupplemented kelp. Antibiotic-treated abalone incorporated 14C-labelled strain C4 proteins into their tissue. Although most of the radiolabelled bacterial protein was incorporated into the hepatopancreas, incorporation was also observed in the gills, foot, adductor muscle and intestine.

Following the starvation period, wet weight loss was 13.4%. Crude protein and NFE accounted for 69.9% and 31.5%, respectively, of the total net loss in dry weight that was calculated to be a total loss of 3.57 kcal/organism. Lipid content of the tissue increased by 1.0% (dry weight) while protein content remained unchanged. Plasma levels of free amino acid, soluble protein and glucose were determined on days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 27. The level of plasma glucose significantly decreased after the first 7 days, 34 to 10 μm/ml, and then leveled at 15 μm/mL. Soluble protein in the plasma decreased from 3.33 to 2.6 mg per ml during the starvation period. Taurine was the principal free amino acid among the plasma amino acids, comprising approximately 50-65% and showing a net decrease of almost 75% at 27 days. For the essential amino acids, gross levels of histidine and arginine decreased significantly and correspondingly produced substantially higher net decreases. For the non-essential amino acids, plasma levels of alanine, proline, tyrosine, glutamic acid, and serine decreased significantly by day 27 or earlier, but proportional composition remained similar. After starvation, changes in the gross amounts (μg/mg total dry weight) of some essential and non-essential amino acids in the muscle and visceral tissue occurred, but their relative proportions remained essentially unchanged. The ratio of the concentration of non-essential to essential amino acids in both the muscle and viscera (∼ 1.9) did not change after starvation. The mean net change of non-essential amino acid content per abalone (within muscle tissue) was higher (- 41.8) than that of the essential amino acids (- 8.9). In contrast to all other amino acids, little or no loss of arginine, histidine and threonine occurred. Plasma levels of carbohydrates and protein in starved abalone dramatically decrease within the first two days and then decrease very slowly. Muscle protein is the principal source of energy, and non-essential amino acids are preferentially used. Retention of arginine in the muscle tissue may reflect its need in arginophosphate for muscle contraction.

As a result, stripping the spats (3-5 mm) off by anaesthetization and switching the diet from live diatoms to artificial powdered diet in combination has to be performed in most of the abalone farms. This manipulation normally leads to more than 50% mortality. Here we report the direct use of the unicellular green alga Platymonas helgolandica Kylin var. tsingtaoensis as a potential alga to be used to settle the veliger larvae of the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai and to feed the postlarvae. Settlement rate of 2-day-old veliger larvae in mono culture of P. helgolandica could be as high as 92% (± 4.2%) on day 10 in small scale trials, higher than that in the selected benthic diatom strain (53.6% ± 12.7%) when settled in the water in which bacteria propagation was controlled by treatment of 2 ppm of benzylpenicillinum calcium and streptomycin sulfate. Postlarvae fed solely on P. helgolandica or the selected benthic diatom Navicula-2005-A grew at rates of 40.1 (± 1.9) and 45.8 (± 3.4) μm day- 1, respectively, when raised at 22 °C until day 50 postfertilization. P. helgolandica was shown to have distinct diurnal settling rhythm characterized with a peak of settled cells in the middle of the night for cell division and a peak of free-swimming cells in the middle of the day. High density of attached P. helgolandica cells on the inner surface of the culture facility in the night fits the nocturnal feeding behavior of the abalone spats. Judged by the promising larvae settling rate, growth and survival rates of the postlarvae fed with this alga, the free-swimming micro-green alga P. helgolandica constitutes a potential species for settling the veliger larvae and for supporting the growth of postlarvae as well. © 2006.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2006.03.028,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746937114
Park J.; Kim P.-K.; Jo J.-Y.,Growth performance of disk abalone Haliotis discus hannai in pilot- and commercial-scale recirculating aquaculture systems,2008,Aquaculture International,16,3,191,202,,"The study investigated the growth performance of abalone from juvenile to marketable size in a commercial-scale recirculating aquaculture system. The rearing system consisted of 12 raceways (4.0 × 0.8 × 0.6 m) with a protein skimmer and a submerged biofilter for juveniles and 10 raceways (6.6 × 1.3 × 0.6 m) with a protein skimmer and a trickling biofilter for on-growing. Sea mustard (Undaria pinnatifida) and kelp (Laminaria japonica) were fed to the abalone. The total weight of abalone in the recirculating aquaculture system at the juvenile stage increased from 22.0 kg (average shell length 24.5 mm) to 75.5 kg (average shell length 42.5 mm) after 180 days. Feed conversion ratios increased slightly from 13.7 for the first 90 days to 16.3 thereafter. The shell growth rate of juvenile abalone between 24.5 mm and 34.8 mm was 3.4 mm month-1, while for juveniles between 34.8 mm and 42.5 mm it was 2.6 mm month-1. The total weight of abalone in the recirculating aquaculture system for the on-growing stage increased from 100.0 kg (average shell length 44.0 mm) to 433.3 kg (average shell length 72.7 mm) after 570 days. The feed conversion ratios for the first 173 days, the next 320 days, and the last 570 days were 19.6, 22.1, and 24.8, respectively. The growth rate of the average shell length during the on-growing period was 1.5 mm month-1. Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) concentrations were stabilized below 0.12 mg l-1 in the juvenile recirculating system and 0.14 mg l-1 in the on-growing recirculating system after conditioning of the biofilters. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.",10.1007/s10499-007-9136-8,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43149096309

Seaweeds were reared in a biofiltration unit with fishpond waste water effluents. The three algal species were found to contain high protein contents which would be related to its production under the high nitrogen culture conditions of the biofilter system. Protein and carbohydrate contents were highest in H. musciformis and lowest in G. cornea. Survival rates of juvenile abalone were very good, regardless of the algae fed. Feed intake of H. spinella was highest, followed by H. musciformis. Growth rates of abalone were within the range obtained under commercial conditions, final shell length and weight being significantly highest in animals fed H. spinella and lowest in those fed G. cornea. Feeding G. cornea lead to the lowest growth performance due to the lowest feed intake, whereas feed conversion ratios were significantly highest for H. musciformis and protein efficiency ratios were higher for both H. spinella and G. cornea. This study suggested the good potential of any of the three red seaweeds tested-successfully produced by the biofilter system, their nutritional composition being similar to other macroalgae used as feed for abalone and matching the abalone protein and lipid requirements-hence promoting growth and survival. Nevertheless, the biofilter produced macroalgae H. spinella showed the highest dietary value for juvenile of H. tuberculata coccinea. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In these systems fish is cultured next to other organisms, which are converting otherwise discharged nutrients into valuable products. These conversions are analyzed based on nitrogen and phosphorous balances using a mass balance approach. The analytical concept of this review comprises a hypothetical system design with five modules: (1) the conversion of feed nutrients into fish biomass, the ""Fish-Biomass- Converter""; (2) the separation of solid and dissolved fish waste/nutrients; the ""Fish-Waste-Processor""; (3) the conversion of dissolved fish waste/nutrients, the ""Phototrophic-herbivore-Converter""; (4 and 5) the conversion of solid fish waste, the ""Bacterial-Waste-Converter"", or the ""Detrivorous-Converter"". In the reviewed examples, fish culture alone retains 20-50% feed nitrogen (N) and 15-65% feed phosphorous (P). The combination of fish culture with phototrophic conversion increases nutrient retention of feed N by 15-50% and feed P by up to 53%. If in addition herbivore consumption is included, nutrient retention decreases by 60-85% feed N and 50-90% feed P. This is according to the general observation of nutrient losses from one trophic level to the next. The conversion of nutrients into bacteria and detrivorous worm biomass contributes only in smaller margins (e.g. 7% feed N and 6% feed P and 0.06% feed N 0.03 × 10-3% feed P, respectively). All integrated modules have their specific limitations, which are related to uptake kinetics, nutrient preference, unwanted conversion processes and abiotic factors. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Sekino M.; Hara M.,Individual assignment tests proved genetic boundaries in a species complex of Pacific abalone (genus Haliotis),2007,Conservation Genetics,8,4,823,841,,"We conducted this study to find genetic evidence to distinguish the members of Pacific abalone species complex (Haliotis discus hannai, H. discus discus, H. madaka, and H. gigantea) based on microsatellite DNA markers, illustrating the potential of microsatellites for species-assignment. First, we addressed the transferability of H. discus hannai microsatellites to the three other members of Pacific abalone and five additional species (H. diversicolor aquatilis, H. midae, H. corrugata, H. fulgens, and H. rubra). Second, using the microsatellites we applied two types of individual assignment testing (the distance-based assignment and Bayesian model-based clustering) to individuals from the Pacific abalone species. A total of 24 microsatellites were subjected to PCR trials for nine Haliotis species, and the cross-species amplification performance of these markers turned out to drop precipitously even for less divergent congeners. Within the Pacific abalone species complex, four of the 24 markers were not transferable to H. gigantea, suggesting a solid genetic boundary between H. gigantea and H. discus hannai, H. discus discus, and H. madaka. Among the three latter abalones, both assignment tests achieved approximately 90% or more success rate of assignment. The feasibility of the microsatellite markers to classify species sheds light on the genetic management of the Pacific abalone species complex. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",10.1007/s10592-006-9229-3,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34249008833

A 350 g casein per kilogram diet was included into the CS diet. The whole casein was then substituted by: (1) 300 g fishmeal and 200 g soybean meal per kilogram diet (FS), (2) 200 g fishmeal, 200 g soybean meal and 130 g krill meal per kilogram diet (FSK), (3) 200 g fishmeal, 200 g soybean meal and 280 g red crab meal per kilogram diet (FSC) or (4) 200 g fishmeal, 200 g soybean meal and 130 g shrimp head meal per kilogram diet (FSS). In addition, a 50-g by-product of green tea per kilogram diet was included in the FS diet to form the FSG diet. Sea tangle (ST)diet was supplied to abalone as a control feed. Weight gain, final shell length and final shell width of abalone fed with the various substitution feeds (FS, FSK, FSC, FSS and FSG) were not different from those obtained with the CS diet. All the formulated feeds, however, produced higher weight gain and final shell width values than the ST diet. The results of this study show that casein can be replaced with a combination of fishmeal, soybean meal, krill meal, crab meal and/or shrimp head meal in the diet without a retardation of growth of abalone. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1365-2095.2007.00505.x,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-38049002583
Lin A.; Meyers M.A.,Growth and structure in abalone shell,2005,Materials Science and Engineering: A,390,1-Feb,27,41,,"The growth and self-assembly of aragonitic calcium carbonate found in the shell of abalone (Haliotis) is described. This was accomplished through the close examination of laboratory-grown flat pearl samples and cross-sectional slices of the nacreous shell. Further understanding of the sequenced assembly has been obtained. It has been confirmed that the growth of the aragonite component of the composite occurs by the successive nucleation of aragonite crystals and their arrest by means of a protein-mediated mechanism; it takes place in the ""Christmas-tree pattern"" [Nature 49 (1994) 371]. It is shown that the protein layer is virtually absent where plates on a same plane abut (along lateral surfaces of tiles). This suggests a mechanism of c-axis aragonite growth arrest by the deposition of a protein layer of approximately 20-30 nm that is periodically activated and determines the thickness of the aragonite platelets, which are remarkably constant (0.5 μm). This platelet size was measured for animals with shell diameters of 10, 50, and 200 mm and was found to be constant. The overall growth process is expressed in terms of parameters incorporating the anisotropy of growth velocity in aragonite (Vc, the velocity along c axis, and Vab, the velocity in basal plane). Comparison of laboratory-raised and naturally-grown abalone indicates growth regulated by the level of proteinaceous saturation. Naturally-grown abalone exhibits mesolayers (growth bands) ∼0.3 mm apart; it is proposed that they result from seasonal interruptions in feeding patterns, creating thicker (∼10-20 μm) layers of protein. These mesolayers play a critical role in the mechanical properties, and are powerful crack deflectors. The viscoplastic deformation of the organic inter-tile layers is responsible for the significant improvement of tensile strength over the tensile strength of monolithic aragonite. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

To provide the red algal species in a diet suitable for juvenile abalone three propagation methods; spore production, protoplast isolation, and fragment culture were investigated. The potential algae requirements and consumable costs for each propagation method were determined, using experimental data and values from the literature, to assess the viability of utilizing each of these propagation methods in a commercial abalone nursery. The use of red algal spores required 592-52,000 kg of algae, depending on the level of spore release and the percentage of fertile algal thalli collected. Protoplast isolation reduced the amount of algal biomass to 8.55-910 kg but was affected by the efficiency of the isolation procedure. Even at an efficient production of 1 × 108 protoplasts·g-1 wet weight alga the cost of consumables (enzymes) was $US 13,576. A feeding trial utilizing Laureneia sp. fragments adhered to the plates using agar, produced juvenile abalone growth rates comparable to those obtained with the current commercial nursery diet of the green alga Ulvella lens plus the diatom Navicula cf. jeffreyi. The Laurencia fragments did not regenerate on the plates so it was reapplied weekly, which is not feasible on a commercial scale because it would require 10.6 t of Laureneia and 443 kg of agar at a cost of $US 34,899. Gracilaria sp. fragments were able to regenerate with a growth rate of 4.42%·day-1 and therefore the algal fragments would only need to be applied to the PVC plates once, at the start of the later nursery phase (5 mm SL), reducing the amount of algal biomass to 432 kg. We therefore conclude that regenerating fragment culture (fragments <1 mm) is the only method that could successfully produce red algal diets for juvenile abalone on a commercial scale in the later nursery phase.",10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[737:TAPMAT]2.0.CO;2,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34648830929

Parents from three full-sib families produced from two wild abalone populations (Japan and China) were used for the study. Metamorphic success and larval growth in four inbred (F = 0.25) and four outbred families were evaluated to 20 d postfertilization. In set I, inbreeding depression was 8.65% for metamorphic success, and -1.06, 3.25, and 4.98% for larval size at days 6, 10, and 20, respectively. In set II, inbreeding depression was 39.3% for metamorphic success, and 1.92, 4.99, and 3.37% for size at days 6, 10, and 20, respectively. Additionally, there were significant maternal effects on metamorphosis and larval size on day 6 (P < 0.01) in set I, which became insignificant at days 10 and 20. Maternal effects were absent in set II. The results of this study suggest that inbreeding at F = 0.25 significantly affects larval growth and greatly reduces metamorphic success in the Pacific abalone. © Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2005.",10.1577/A04-021.1,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-23044506489

More than ten species are commercially used to produce phycocolloids, fertilizers, plant growth control products, human food or animal fodder and feed additives. These multiple uses of algae offer a number of possibilities for coupling this activity to salmon, abalone and filter-feeder farming. In this context, different experiments carried out in Chile have demonstrated that Gracilaria chilensis and Macrocystis pyrifera have great potential in the development of an integrated aquaculture strategy. The present Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) approach study showed that Gracilaria can be cultured best at 1 m depth whereas Macrocystis has an especially good growth response at 3 m depth. Both species use available nitrogen efficiently. On the other hand, high intensities of solar radiation (UV and PAR) can be critical at low depths of cultivation, and our results indicate that both species show photosynthetic susceptibility mainly at noon during the summer. The demand of Macrocystis for abalone feeding is increasing, thus improving the opportunity for developing an integrated nutrient waste recycling activity in Chile. Although Gracilaria shows a higher nitrogen uptake capacity than Macrocystis, its market value does not yet allow a massive commercial scaling. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",10.1007/s10811-007-9297-x,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149241169

The settlement and metamorphosis are two critical stages during its development period, which has direct influence on abalone survival and production. The influence of reactive oxygen species (hydrogen peroxide) on abalone embryo and juvenile development were examined in this study. Larvae of Haliotis diversicolor supertexta were induced to settlement and metamorphose by exposure to seawater supplemented with hydrogen peroxide. They had the best performance at 800 μmol/L. The concentration of 1 000 μmol/L or higher was toxic to the larvae, as the larvae could settle down only at benthic diatom plates without complete metamorphosis. In addition, H2O2 adding time was critical to the larval performance. 24h after two-day post-fertilization was proved to be the optimal adding time. In this paper, two action mechanisms of hydrogen peroxide are discussed: (1) hydrogen peroxide has direct toxicity to ciliated cells, thus cause apoptosis; (2) hydrogen peroxide, as a product from catecholamines' autoxidation process in vivo, can reverse this process to produce neuro-transmitters to induce abalone metamorphosis. © 2008 Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s00343-008-0238-6,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69249104460

The growth, survival and grazing rates of juvenile Haliotis laevigata Donovan, 1808 were monitored in response to the density and biochemical composition of N. jeffreyi cultured in each of the six treatments. Navicula jeffreyi Hallegraeff et Burford grown in high light had a proportionally lower protein content and a higher carbohydrate and fat content (22 ± 0.6%; 17.6 ± 1.5%; 7.5 ± 0.7%, respectively) compared to the content of diatoms grown in low light (30 ± 0.6%; 14.3 ± 2.5%; 4.7 ± 1%, respectively). Under low light, the carbohydrate content of N. jeffreyi was marginally higher in low nitrate treatments (17%) compared to standard (14%) and high (12%) nitrate. Juveniles grazed a larger number of diatoms when the protein content of the diatoms was low, possibly compensating for the lower protein levels. In high light, dense N. jeffreyi biofilms produced elevated pH levels which most likely resulted in the mortality of a large number of juvenile H. laevigata.

To counter grazing effects, constitutive and induced anti-herbivory responses evolved in seaweeds. Feeding-assayed induction experiments were conducted in the laboratory to investigate whether 14 d grazing periods by either the periwinkle Littorina brevicula or the abalone Haliotis discus induced anti-herbivory defences in the green alga Ulva pertusa and the brown alga Laminaria japonica. Where appropriate, assays were repeated with artificial food containing lipophilic algal extracts, using dichloromethane (DCM) as a solvent, to test whether or not snails induced chemical defences. While exposure to periwinkles reduced palatability of fresh L. japonica pieces for naïve conspecific grazers, no such effect was displayed by abalone-exposed L. japonica pieces. Patterns of grazer specificity in the palatability of fresh algae were not confirmed when using artificial food containing algal DCM extracts. This suggests that L. japonica either induced morphological defences or periwinkle-deterrent substances originated from the non-lipophilic fraction of defensive chemicals. Grazer-specific induced responses were not apparent in U. pertusa assays. This study revealed that the induction of chemical anti-herbivory responses depends not only on the type of grazer but also on the type of alga on which the grazer feeds. © Inter-Research 2008.",10.3354/meps07255,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-39049147347

In aquaculture situations, abalone are usually provided with static artificial food pellets, effectively removing the tactile stimulus. This study investigated the effects of tactile stimuli from suspended particles on pellet ingestion, growth, behaviour and meat quality of juvenile paua (length 40-45 mm). Over eleven months, individuals were offered a commercial pellet diet (AbFeed™) and small quantities of one of four particulate materials: macerated seaweed (Gracilaria spp. and Macrocystis pyrifera) and 2 sizes of synthetic PVC fragments. There was seasonal variation in the ingestion rate of abalone from all treatments and the control (no stimulants) with lowest rates during winter (June to September) and highest rates in summer (December to February).The specific growth rate (% body weight gain per day) and shell length increase varied seasonally. Of the four treatments, the only effective stimulant was Gracilaria spp. which resulted in summer shell growth of 110.6 ± 3.2 μm d- 1 compared with 86.9 ± 4.0 μm d- 1 for control abalone. Behavioural observations showed that when Gracilaria particles were present, abalone spent > 80% of their time engaged in feeding-related activity. Control abalone, without the algal stimulant, spent most of their time in a sedentary position. None of the particulate stimulants tested had any significant effect on food conversion ratio, water content, protein, lipid and glycogen levels or meat tenderness. These parameters were, however, significantly affected by season. A preliminary trial of the Gracilaria particle treatment in a commercial system over 90 days enhanced the growth of cultured H. iris (45 ± 5 mm shell length) by 15.3%. The main commercial implication of this research is that the addition of algal stimulants is suggested as a cost-effective means of improving abalone performance using pre-existing culture systems and food types. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The sequence of 41 amino acids was determined by Edman degradation supported by mass spectrometry. The most abundant amino acids were cysteine (19.5%), histidine (17%), and arginine (14.6%). The positively charged amino acids were almost counterbalanced by negatively charged ones resulting in a calculated isoelectric point of 7.86. Atomic-force microscopy studies of the interaction of the protein with calcite surfaces in supersaturated calcium carbonate solution or calcium chloride solution showed that the protein bound specifically to calcite steps, inhibiting further crystal growth at these sites in carbonate solution and preventing crystal dissolution when carbonate was substituted with chloride. Therefore this protein was named perlinhibin. X-ray diffraction investigation of the crystal after atomic-force microscopy growth experiments showed that the formation of aragonite was induced on the calcite substrate around holes caused by perlinhibin crystal-growth inhibition. The strong interaction of the protein with calcium carbonate was also shown by vapor diffusion crystallization. In the presence of the protein, the crystal surfaces were covered with holes due to protein binding and local inhibition of crystal growth. In addition to perlinhibin, we isolated and sequenced a perlinhibin-related protein, indicating that perlinhibin may be a member of a family of closely related proteins. © 2007 by the Biophysical Society.",10.1529/biophysj.106.100636,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-34548224707

In addition, direct observation of reversible mechanical behavior was made in the viscoelastic reformation of matrix ligaments after failure. Crystalline β-sheet structures identified through electron diffraction suggested the presence of protein structures similar to spider or cocoon silk, and the reversible mechanism was attributed to hydration-induced unfolding and refolding of domains in these silklike proteins.

Purified diets supplemented with 0, 40, 800 mg PN kg-1 or 80 mg kg-1 of 4-deoxypyridoxine (PN antagonist) were fed to adult abalone (initial weight 45.77±0.25 g; initial shell length 68.02±0.78 mm) for 90 days. The air-dried brown kelp, Laminaria japonica, was used as a control diet. Each diet was fed to three replicate groups of abalone in a recirculation system using a completely randomised design. The results showed that weight gain ratio (WGR) of the abalone generally increased with the level of dietary PN supplementation though no significant differences were found among the treatments (P>0.05). Phagocytic and phenoloxidase activities were significantly higher in abalone fed diets supplemented with 800 mg PN kg -1 than those fed the PN-free diet or the one with 4-deoxypyridoxine (P<0.05). Agglutination titre and respiratory burst activity were significantly higher in abalone fed diets supplemented with 40 mg PN kg -1 than those fed the PN-free diet or the one with 4-deoxypyridoxine (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in immunological characteristics between the abalone fed the diet containing 40 mg PN kg -1 and those fed the diet containing 800 mg PN kg-1 (P>0.05). L. japonica resulted in significantly lower agglutination titre, respiratory burst and phagocytic activities than the artificial diets supplemented with 40 or 800 mg PN kg-1 (P<0.05). Total haemocyte count (THC), serum protein concentration, and the activities of lysozyme and acid phosphatase were not significantly affected by the dietary treatments (P>0.05). These results demonstrate that dietary deficiency of pyridoxine suppresses the immune functions in H. discus hannai, and further investigations are needed to optimise the dietary level of this vitamin for maintaining the best immune responses in abalone. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Over 6,000 t per annum of kelp Ecklonia maxima are now harvested for this purpose, and some kelp beds are reaching maximum sustainable limits. Research into seaweed aquaculture as feed (Ulva and some Gracilaria) for abalone started in the late 1990s on the southeast coast (where there are no kelp beds) using abalone waste water. A growing body of evidence suggests that a mixed diet of kelp plus other seaweeds can give growth rates at least as good as compound feed, and can improve abalone quality and reduce parasite loads. A pilot scale Ulva lactuca and abalone integrated recirculation unit using 25% recirculation was designed and built on the south west coast of South Africa using one 12,000-L abalone tank containing 13,200 15±2.5 g abalone, connected to two 3,000-L seaweed tanks containing an initial starting biomass of 10 kg of seaweed, replicated 3 times. In an 18-month period, there were no significant differences in abalone health or growth rates, sediment build up and composition, mobile macro fauna densities and species between the recirculation or the flow-through units. Transfer of oxygen generated by the seaweeds to the abalone tanks was poor, resulting in the recirculated abalone tanks having lower (33%) dissolved oxygen concentrations than a comparable flow-through abalone unit. Seaweed nutrient content and specific growth rates in the units were comparable to seaweeds cultivated in fertilized effluent (SGR=3.2±3.4%.day-1; Yield=0.2±0.19 kg.m2.day-1). Indications were that at this low recirculation ratio the seaweeds in the units were nutrient limited and that there were no negative effects to the abalone being cultivated in such a recirculation unit at this recirculation ratio. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",10.1007/s10811-007-9239-7,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149260337

In Experiment 1, the level of nitrate in the culture medium did not significantly affect the protein content of Cocconeis sp., Cylindrotheca closterium or Nitzschia ovalis, and variation in the growth of post-larval Haliotis iris was not associated with nitrate level or the protein content of the diatoms. When the same six diatom diets were added daily as cell suspensions, growth and survival were much lower than for the equivalent strains fed as established films (P < 0.0001). In Experiment 2a, the protein content of Navicula incerta was elevated by nitrate supplementation, and the high nitrate strain retained a higher protein content (P = 0.005) even after 24 days growing in unenriched, flowing seawater. Haliotis rufescens post-larvae grew significantly faster when fed N. incerta H than when fed N. incerta S (P = 0.006) and survival was also higher with this diet (67 versus 54%). In Experiment 2b, there was no significant effect of nitrate level on protein content of four diatoms or the performance of post-larval H. rufescens. There was, however, a strong positive correlation (r = 0.95, P < 0.0001) between post-larval survival and the lipid content of the diatom diets. Post-larval growth showed positive, but marginally non-significant, relationships with diatom protein and carbohydrate, but no relationship with lipid content. Overall, only one of seven benthic diatom species acclimated to high-nitrate growth medium displayed significantly elevated protein content. Diatom protein content explained relatively little of the variation in food value of diatom strains for post-larval abalone but lipid content correlated strongly with post-larval survival. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The total specific growth rate (SGR) during the 152 days, neither the SGR in the first 76 days nor in the second 76 days, was significantly influenced by the interaction between vitamins A and D. Dietary vitamins A and D significantly stimulated viscera 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 [25(OH)D3] and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [1α,25(OH)2D3] contents in a cooperative fashion. Dietary vitamin A generally increased the alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity in viscera except the excessive supplement (1 × 106 IU/kg), which significantly decreased AKP activity. Dietary vitamin D significantly increased AKP activity. Contents of P, not Ca and Mg, in soft body increased with dietary vitamin D supplement. Dietary vitamin A significantly improved contents of lipid and retinol in soft body and viscera, respectively.

Results showed that the daily increment in shell length (DISL) of abalone in the treatment with 1 × 103 IU vitamin A per kilogram diet was significantly higher than that with 0 or 1 × 106 IU vitamin A per kilogram supplementation (P < 0.05). Vitamin A deficiency (0 IU/kg) significantly elevated the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reductase (GR) in the viscera of abalone (P < 0.05). In muscle, the effects of vitamin A deficiency on SOD and GPX activities were the same as those in viscera, however, the activity of GR significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Vitamin A deficiency significantly decreased the ratio of CAT to SOD (catalase/superoxide dismutase), in viscera (P < 0.05). Nevertheless, it significantly decreased the ratio of GR to GPX in muscle (P < 0.05). Compared with the supplement of 1 × 103 IU vitamin A per kilogram, excessive vitamin A (1 × 106 IU/kg) had no significant effects on the activities of CAT, SOD and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) (P > 0.05), but significantly elevated GPX and GR activities in viscera (P < 0.05). In muscle, the activities of CAT, SOD, GPX, GST and GR were significantly decreased by the excessive dietary vitamin A supplement (P < 0.05). Compared with the supplement of 1 × 103 IU vitamin A per kilogram, vitamin A-excessive had no significant effect on the value of ratio of CAT to SOD either in viscera or in muscle (P > 0.05). The ratio of GR to GPX was significantly decreased in viscera, but significantly elevated in muscle in the vitamin A-excessive group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, optimum supplement of vitamin A (1 × 103 IU/kg) was beneficial for abalone to maintain maximum growth and antioxidant system.

Two TPxs were isolated from a disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) cDNA library, named as AbTPx1 and AbTPx2, respectively. AbTPx1 and AbTPx2 consist of 1315 and 1045 bp full-length cDNA with 753 and 597 bp open reading frames encoding 251 and 199 amino acids, respectively. The TPx signature motif 1 (FYPLDFTFVCPTEI) and motif 2 (GEVCPA) were conserved in both AbTPx1 and AbTPx2 amino acid sequences. Purified recombinant abalone TPx fusion proteins catalyzed the reduction of H2O2 and butyl hydroperoxide in peroxidase assays. Furthermore, both AbTPx fusion proteins were shown to protect super-coiled DNA from damage by metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) in vitro. Escherichia coli cells transformed with AbTPx1 and AbTPx2 coding sequences in pMAL-c2x showed resistance to H2O2 at 0.8 mM concentration by in vivo H2O2 tolerance assay. AbTPx1 and AbTPx2 mRNA were constitutively expressed in gill, mantle, abductor muscle and digestive tract in a tissue specific manner. Additionally, both TPxs mRNA were up-regulated in gill and digestive tract tissues against H2O2 at 3 h post injection. The results indicate that AbTPx1 and AbTPx2 gene expressions are induced by oxidative stress and their respective proteins function in the detoxification of different ROS molecules to maintain efficient antioxidant defense in disk abalone. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Triplicate groups of juvenile abalone (initial weight: 0.71 ± 0.00 g; initial shell length: 15.49 ± 0.04 mm) were fed to satiation one of three semipurified diets containing 0, 50, and 5,000-mg/kg vitamin E, respectively.

We have identified Se-GPx full length cDNA from disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) designated as AbSe-GPx. It has a characteristic codon at 223TGA225 that corresponds to selenocysteine (Sec) amino acid as U75. The full length cDNA consists of 675 bp, an open reading frame encoding 225 amino acids. Sequence characterization revealed that AbSe-GPx contains a characteristic GPx signature motif 2 (97LGFPCNQF104), an active site motif (183WNFEKF188) and essential residues for the enzymatic function. Additionally, the eukaryotic selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) is conserved in the 3′ UTR. The AbSe-GPx amino acid sequence exhibited the highest level of identity (46%) with insect (Ixodes scapularis) GPx, and shares 41% with bivalve (Unio tumidus) Se-GPx. The RT-PCR analysis revealed that AbSe-GPx mRNA was expressed constitutively in gill, mantle, gonad, abductor muscle, digestive tract, and hemocytes in a tissue specific manner. AbSe-GPx mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated in gill and digestive tract tissues after H2O2 injection and Vibrio alginolyticus infection. However, AbSe-GPx expression was not up-regulated after Aroclor 1254 injection. These results indicate that AbSe-GPx mRNA is expressed at a basal level in abalone tissues, which can be up-regulated transcriptionally by H2O2 oxidative stress and Vibrio alginolyticus infection. Therefore, AbSe-GPx may be involved in a protective role against H2O2 oxidative stress and immune defence against bacterial infection. © 2008.",10.1016/j.fsi.2008.02.001,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51449106300

Between 80 and 102 days PS, L5 teeth appeared on the radula and there were fewer lateral serrations, consistent with the adult form of the animal, suggesting that this development is in preparation for feeding on macroalgae. Digestive gland complexity (tubule number and density) increased between 80 and 102 days PS and is consistent with greater enzyme production and increased digestive efficiency. Of the enzymes studied, laminarinase and lipase exhibited the highest activities in animals fed a diatom diet, both significantly increasing with age of the abalone. High laminarinase activities reflect higher utilisation of the algal polysaccharide chrysolaminarin in the diatom diet. Ingestion of artificial diet had no adverse effects on the morphological development of the digestive system, but trypsin activity in abalone fed the artificial diet was significantly higher than diatom-fed abalone of similar age, indicative of higher levels of protein in the artificial diet. Similarly, lipase activity was significantly lower in abalone fed the artificial diet and may reflect an inability to digest the fish oil component, which is not found in their natural diet. Future development of artificial diets, especially for juvenile abalone, should focus on the levels and type of lipid provided. Runt abalone (i.e. under-developed compared to their siblings) had radulae similar to much younger 80 days PS abalone and digestive tissue degradation at 137 days PS is evidence that runts have limited ability to ingest food and are nutritionally compromised. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Selection for phenotypically plastic antiherbivory responses has been suggested for many plants, including a few species of seaweed, but little is known about its specificity or seasonality. 2 Multi-factorial experiments tested the effects of consumer identity (Littorina brevicula vs. Haliotis discus) and season (summer vs. autumn) on the induction of antiherbivory defences in the brown seaweed Ecklonia cava. Following a grazer-free acclimation phase, algae were incubated with grazers (treatment phase) and, subsequently, without grazers (recovery phase). Feeding preference assays, were used to assess differences in consumption rates between grazer-exposed and control plants. 3 In summer, Littorina, but not Haliotis, induced defence in Ecklonia. This defence vanished by the end of the recovery phase. In autumn, neither exposure to direct attack nor to waterborne cues induced defensive responses. 4 Both consumer identity and season of consumption can influence the ability of a given macroalgal species to induce antiherbivory defences.

Cases such as Epinephelus maculatus, described here, show that the numerical estimation of parasite biodiversity in coral reefs could reach more than ten times the number of fish species; consequently, the extinction of certain fish species from endangered coral reefs would result in the co-extinction of at least ten times the number of parasite species. E. maculatus is a grouper of intermediate size (1-2 kg) and common in the coral reefs of New Caledonia, South Pacific. Based on the examination of more than 800 monogenean specimens, 12 species of monogeneans (ten diplectanids and two ancyrocephalids) were differentiated on the gills. These species of diplectanids have not been found in other epinephelines in the same area and thus are considered as specific to this host. In addition, three species of copepods, and isopod larvae, are present on the gills; E. maculatus thus has a total of 16 species of gill ectoparasites, which can be found together on a single individual fish. Diplectanids include Laticola dae Journo & Justine, 2006, which is the most abundant species representing about 50% of the specimens, and nine species which are rare, each representing 2-7% of the specimens: Diplectanum uitoe n. sp. and eight species of Pseudorhabdosynochus Yamaguti, 1958. D. uitoe, provisionally attributed to Diplectanum Diesing, 1858, is characterised by a small conical penis with internal walls. Pseudorhabdosynochus auitoe n. sp., P. buitoe n. sp., P. cuitoe n. sp., P. duitoe n. sp., P. euitoe n. sp. and P. fuitoe n. sp. are differentiated on the basis of the morphology of the sclerotised vagina, but are very similar in other characteristics; P. guitoe n. sp. is characterised by a quadriloculate organ with very thick walls and a very small sclerotised vagina; and P. huitoe n. sp. is characterised by its sclerotised vagina and by very long ventral and dorsal haptoral bars. Two rare (2-3% of specimens) ancyrocephalids, Haliotrema epinepheli Young, 1969 and Haliotrema sp., are briefly described in relation to the male copulatory organs and haptoral bars; H. epinepheli is apparently a generalist species found in various epinephelines and other fish species.

It is induced by the type I interferon system (IFN α/β) in various vertebrates, but its expression has not been identified or characterized in mollusks or other multi-cellular invertebrates to date. In this study, we isolated the Mx gene from a disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) normalized cDNA library. Mx cDNA was sequenced, cloned and compared to other known Mx proteins. The full-length 1664 bp of abalone Mx cDNA contained a 1533-bp open reading frame that codes for 511 amino acids. Within the coding sequence of abalone Mx, characteristic features were found, such as a tripartite guanosine-5′-triphosphate (GTP)-binding motif and a dynamin family signature. In addition, leucine residues in the C-terminal region displayed a special leucine domain at L468, L475, L489 and L510, suggesting that abalone Mx may have a similar oligomerization function as other leucine zipper motifs. Abalone Mx protein exhibited 44% amino acid similarity with channel catfish Mx1, rainbow trout Mx2 and Atlantic halibut Mx. Abalones were injected intramuscularly with the known IFN inducer poly I:C and RT-PCR was performed for Mx mRNA analysis. The results showed enhanced Mx expression in abalone gill and digestive tissues 24 h as well as 48 h after injection of poly I:C. Mx mRNA was expressed in gill, digestive gland, mantle and foot tissues in healthy abalone, suggesting that the basal level of Mx expressed is tissue-specific. There is no known Mx protein closely related to abalone Mx according to phylogenetic analysis. Abalone Mx may have diverged from a common gene ancestor of fish and mammalian Mx proteins, since abalone Mx showed high similarity in terms of conserved tripartite GTP-binding, dynamin family signature motifs and poly I:C enhancement of Mx mRNA expression. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Shell area preferences of the sabellid were also investigated. Abalone diet (fresh kelp, Ecklonia maxima or Abfeed™) did not affect sabellid settlement success (F1,30 = 1.05; p <= 0.31). There were significant differences in settlement between shell regions, with the highest number of sabellids settling near the respiratory pores (F2,30 = 61.0; p < 0.001). Percentage occupation rate of tubes 96h after settlement did not differ between dietary treatments. There were no significant interactions between diet and shell region for sabellid settlement (F2,30 = 0.77, p = 0.69) and tube formation (F2,30 = 1.02, p = 0.67) or for the percentage occupation rate of the tubes (F9,180 = 0.11, p = 0.73). Thus, infestation intensity in relation to shell region can be estimated independent of abalone diet. For treatment purposes, total settlement after 36 days of exposure can be used to identify the shell areas on which most sabellids will be found.

Survival was ca. 100% at 20 °C, and between 68% and 75% at 25 °C. The highest gross growth rate (109 ± 4.3 μm d- 1, 69 ± 3.9 mg d- 1) was observed in abalone from the combination 20 °C-00:24 L:D. Slowest GGR (38 ± 4.1 μm d- 1, 26 ± 1.5 mg d- 1) was observed in the combination 25 °C-24:00 L:D. Organisms from 25 °C exhibited signs of the withering syndrome at the end of the experiment. Gross energy content (4.4 to 4.6 kcal g- 1 tissue dry wt, TDW) and crude protein (60 to 68% TDW) were not significantly affected by either temperature or photoperiod, but organisms from 20 °C exhibited lower moisture content (86.8 to 88.6%) and higher tissue:shell ratio (0.34-0.40) than those from 25 °C (88.9 to 92.1%; 0.22-0.31 respectively). Feed consumption markedly increased at night, decreased with age, and was higher at 25 °C than 20 °C, irrespective of photoperiod. Highest C was observed under continuous darkness (0.66 to 0.95% BW d- 1 at 20 °C and 0.84 to 1.25% BW d- 1 at 25 °C), and was lowest under continuous light (0.50 to 0.82% BW d- 1 at 20 °C and 0.71 to 1.02% BW d- 1 at 25 °C). FCR and PER were both affected by temperature but not by photoperiod. Higher PER (2.2 to 3.4) and lower FCR values (0.69 to 1.05) were observed at 20 °C, when compared to 25 °C (PER 1.35 to 2.09, FCR 1.10 to 1.86). Sex ratios were ca. 1:1 in the 00:24 and 12:12 L:D photoperiods, yet ca. 50% of abalone from the 24:00 L:D photoperiod were immature at the end of the experiment. It is concluded that H. fulgens can be best cultured at 20 °C and 00:24 or 12:12 L:D regimes, while sustained temperatures at or above 25 °C may result in cumulative stress, altered physiological rhythms, and delayed maturation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Sample Population - Cartilage tissue from 12 pigs. Procedures - Articular cartilage explants were conditioned with a simulated digest of BO (BOsim) or DN (DNsim) at concentrations of 0, 0.06, or 0.18 mg/mL or indomethacin (INDO sim; 0 or 0.02 mg/mL) for 72 hours. Control explants received digest vehicle only. Explants were or were not stimulated with recombinant human-IL-1β (10 or 0 ng/mL) during the final 48 hours of culture. Concentrations of PGE2, GAG, and NO in media samples (mPGE2, mGAG, and mNO concentrations, respectively)-were analyzed, and explant tissue was stained fluorochromatically to determine chondrocyte viability. Treatment effects during the final 48-hour culture period were analyzed. Results - IL-1 increased mPGE2, mGAG, and mNO concentrations in control explants without adversely affecting cell viability. Treatment with INDOsim blocked PGE2 production and increased mNO concentration in IL-1-stimulated and unstimulated explants and increased mGAG concentration in unstimulated explants. Treatment with DNsim (0.06 and 0.18 mg/mL) reduced mPGE2 concentration in IL-1-stimulated and unstimulated explants, reduced mNO concentration in IL-1-stimulated explants, and increased mNO concentration in unstimulated explants. Treatment with 0.18 mg of DNsim/mL increased cell viability in the presence of IL-1. In IL-l-stimulated explants, BOsim (0.06 and 0.18 mg/mL) reduced mPGE2 concentration, but 0.18 mg of BOsim/mL increased cell viability.

Agardh) Greville (Gigartinales, Rhodophyta) in controlled environments",2008,Aquaculture International,16,4,283,295,,"Increased market demand for algal raw materials has stimulated research and development into new cultivation technologies, particularly in countries with economically important seaweed industries. Chondrus canaliculatus is a red alga endemic to the temperate Pacific coast of South America and produces a complex carrageenan. In Chile, this potential marine resource has been underutilized since the early 1990s, after it was replaced mainly by imports of Kappaphycus and Eucheum from Asia. The study of the cultivation of C. canaliculatus in outdoor tanks demonstrates the potential to produce large quantities of algal material due to the high productivity observed. The material produced may be important in Chile as feed for cultured algal herbivores such as Haliotis spp. Data were obtained on the key factors affecting the growth of this alga, including light, temperature, and nutrient concentrations. The results showed that, on a dry weight basis, productivity varied seasonally between 40 g m-3 wk-1 in autumn and 200 g m-3 wk-1 in spring, and the optimal stocking density in our experiments was 8 kg m-3. Effects of self-shading were among the most important limiting factors in the culture. Discussion is presented on the interactions between temperature, pH, salinity, enrichment with N and P, and water exchange on the maximal growth of C. canaliculatus in this culture. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.",10.1007/s10499-007-9142-x,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45849103090

Here, we define a systematic relationship between the ability of biomolecules in solution to promote the growth of calcite (CaCO3) and their net negative molecular charge and hydrophilicity. The degree of enhancement depends on peptide composition, but not on peptide sequence. Data analysis shows that this rate enhancement arises from an increase in the kinetic coefficient. We interpret the mechanism of growth enhancement to be a catalytic process whereby biomolecules reduce the magnitude of the diffusive barrier, Ek, by perturbations that displace water molecules. The result is a decrease in the energy barrier for attachment of solutes to the solid phase. This previously unrecognized relationship also rationalizes recently reported data showing acceleration of calcite growth rates over rates measured in the pure system by nanomolar levels of abalone nacre proteins. These findings show that the growth-modifying properties of small model peptides may be scaled up to analyze mineralization processes that are mediated by more complex proteins. We suggest that enhancement of calcite growth may now be estimated a priori from the composition of peptide sequences and the calculated values of hydrophilicity and net molecular charge. This insight may contribute to an improved understanding of diverse systems of biomineralization and design of new synthetic growth modulators. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",10.1073/pnas.0605748103,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845876931
Paul N.A.; De Nys R.; Steinberg P.D.,Seaweed-herbivore interactions at a small scale: Direct tests of feeding deterrence by filamentous algae,2006,Marine Ecology Progress Series,323,,1,9,,"High growth rates and temporal or spatial opportunism are considered central to the success of filamentous algae, in particular for escaping or minimising the effects of herbivory. However, the role of chemical defences in filamentous algae has received far less attention. We investigated possible chemical feeding deterrence by filamentous red algae that have conspicuous cellular inclusions (Asparagopsis armata, Anotrichium tenue and Balliella amphiglanda) and 2 others without inclusions (Callithamnion korfense and Ulva sp.). The 3 algae with cellular inclusions were consumed at lower rates by a generalist amphipod, Hyale nigra, than the other 2 algae. To determine the potential role of chemical defences for A. armata, we conducted tests against herbivores using algae in which the production of halogenated metabolites was manipulated. This manipulation had no effect on carbon and nitrogen values of the algae, and allowed us to directly test the role of algal secondary metabolites in defence against herbivores without using artificial diets. Bromide (+) algae (with halogenated metabolites) deterred grazing by 2 mesograzers (Hyale nigra and juvenile abalone Haliotis rubra), which consumed up to 4 times more bromide (-) (metabolite-free) algae than bromide (+) algae. Juveniles of the sea hare Aplysia parvula were not deterred by the chemical defences in bromide (+) A. armata. In field assays, artificial diets containing a crude extract of A. armata were also active against herbivores. Although functional form models typically predict that tolerance - not resistance - should be the key defensive strategy for marine algae with simple architecture, this study demonstrates that resistance traits may also be important and more broadly utilised in filamentous species. © Inter-Research 2006.",10.3354/meps323001,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750630858

Results showed that compared with the normal group, vitamin D deficiency had no significant effect on the weight gain rate (WGR) and daily increment in shell length (DISL) (P < 0.05); excessive vitamin D (5 × 1058 IU/kg) significantly decreased the WGR and DISL of abalone (P < 0.05). The sensitivity of antioxidant enzymes in different tissues (viscera and muscle) of abalone was different to vitamin D deficiency or excess.

Lesoway M.P.; Page L.R.,Growth and differentiation during delayed metamorphosis of feeding gastropod larvae: Signatures of ancestry and innovation,2008,Marine Biology,153,4,723,734,,"Extent of larval growth among marine invertebrates has potentially profound implications for performance by benthic recruits because body size influences many biological processes. Among gastropods, feeding larvae often attain larger size at metamorphic competence than non-feeding larvae of basal gastropod clades. Delay of metamorphosis can further influence size at recruitment if larvae continue to grow during the delay. Some caenogastopod larvae grow during delayed metamorphosis, but opisthobranch larvae do not. Data on larval growth of neritimorph gastropods are needed to help determine which of these growth patterns for planktotrophic gastropod larvae is more derived. We cultured planktotrophic larvae from all three major gastropod clades with feeding larvae through delays of metamorphosis of 3-10 weeks. Larvae of the caenogastropod Euspira lewisii and the euthyneurans Haminoea vesicula (Opisthobranchia) and Siphonaria denticulata (Pulmonata) conformed to previously described growth patterns for their respective major clades. Furthermore, the caenogastropod continued to lengthen the prototroch (ciliary band for swimming and feeding) and to differentiate prospective post-metamorphic structures (gill filaments and radular teeth) during delayed metamorphosis. Larvae of the neritimorph Nerita atramentosa arrested shell growth during delayed metamorphosis but the radula continued to elongate, a pattern most similar to that of non-feeding larvae of Haliotis, a vetigastropod genus. Character mapping on a phylogenetic hypothesis suggests that large larval size and capacity for continued growth during delayed metamorphosis, as exhibited by some caenogastropods, is a derived innovation among feeding gastropod larvae. This novelty may have facilitated post-metamorphic evolution of predatory feeding using a long proboscis. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/s00227-007-0849-z,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38349089993

Among them 12 species of benthic diatom were isolated to form monospecific cultures that were successfully entrapped in alginate beads for long-term storage. The immobilized diatoms remained alive and maintained their capacity to multiply after 1 year of storage in absolute darkness at 4 °C without liquid media. These diatoms were subsequently applied as feed to cultivate post-larvae of H. diversicolor. Growth and survival of the post-larval abalone were examined when they were fed different species of diatoms. Nitzschia grossestriata yielded the best post-larvae harvest (average 112.6 individuals/1000 cm2), in contrast to Cocconeis scutellum, which produced the lowest harvest with an average of 7.7 individuals/1000 cm2 only. Diatoms components analysis showed that Caloneis platycephala had the highest protein content (17.4% dw). Lipid and bound EPS were the highest in Seminavis gracilenta (20.3% dw and 1188.24 pg/100 μm2, respectively). N. grossestriata had the highest soluble EPS at 212.31 pg/100 μm2.

We have shown that Haliotis midae fed a probiotic-supplemented diet have an improved survival and growth rate compared to animals not fed probiotics. The growth rate of small (20 mm) and large (67mm) abalone was improved by 8% and 34%, respectively, in two separate eight-month farm growth trials. Furthermore, the number, and phagocytic activity, of circulating haemocytes was significantly higher (P<0.05) in probiotic treated animals compared to non-treated animals following challenge with the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio anguillarum. Seven days after challenging with V. anguillarum, the probiotic-fed animals had 62% survival compared to 25% survival for non-treated animals. In situ protease assays showed that probiotic treatment significantly increased (P<0.05) protease activity in the intestinal region of the digestive tract of animals fed the probiotic-supplemented feed. This correlated with a significant increase (P<0.05) in the amount of protein digestion and absorption measured in this region of the abalone gut. Histological analysis showed that the digestive glands of animals receiving probiotics were bacteria-free, whereas the digestive glands of 70% of the animals receiving the non-supplemented feed had a high bacterial load. The microorganisms tested in this study therefore have tremendous potential as probiotics for commercially produced H. midae. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, all sampling periods showed significantly less OTC in foot muscle samples relative to corresponding digestive gland samples (p < 0.001). While drug depuration occurred rapidly from foot muscle, unusually high concentrations and long depuration times were measured within the digestive gland. The pharmacokinetic trends in both the foot muscle and digestive gland at 13.4 °C were adequately described by a one-compartment model, while the digestive gland depuration models within the 17.3 °C treatments conformed to a two-compartment model. At both temperatures treatment duration gave rise to significant differences in OTC accumulation and depletion (p < 0.001). Despite this, terminal elimination rate constants were similar. Estimated half-lives were similar among all treatments for digestive gland (23.8-27.5 d) and all treatments for the foot muscle at 13.4 °C (10.7-13.4 d; calculated only for the 13.4 °C treatments). At both temperatures all three durations of drug treatment led to significant reductions in WS-RLP prevalence, foot muscle atrophy, and mortality. WS-RLP re-challenge trials initiated 44, 88, and 122 days following the 10-day treatment at 17.3 °C showed reduced susceptibility to re-infection for up to 88 days after treatment, suggesting that digestive gland OTC residues confer long-term resistance to pathogen. Atomic absorption spectroscopy conducted on both foot muscle and digestive gland found significantly higher concentrations of iron, zinc, and manganese in the digestive gland, offering an explanation behind the underlying mechanism of OTC retention for extended periods within this tissue. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), GABA analogs, and GABA-mimetics associated with certain crustose coralline algae (CCA), are known to induce larval settlement in commercial abalone (Haliotis) species, and other gastropods. Furthermore, mucus secreted from these gastropods has been shown to induce larval settlement, but the stimulatory components of mucus have not been thoroughly investigated. We now present data confirming that GABA is the settlement-inducing effector molecule contained within abalone mucus. To do this, we initially generated anti-GABA for use in immunoenzyme and immunofluorescent microscopy. Using these techniques GABA was identified in the nerves and epithelial cells of the foot, including mucus. Dried mucus samples subject to HPLC analysis revealed a mean concentration of 0.68 mM GABA after sample rehydration. The presence of GABA in these samples was confirmed by time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (TOF-MS). In addition, GABA was detected in the mucus of several abalone species and other gastropods by immunocytochemistry. Subsequent bioassays using both dry and fresh mucus strongly promoted induction of larval settlement. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

C. sublittoralis can grow well in a range of light intensities (830-1,217 lux) and is thus suited for the changing light conditions in a commercial abalone nursery. Achnanthes longipes grows well under high light conditions (1,412-4,400 lux) at low (18°C) and high (25°C) temperatures indicating that this species is more suited to culture in unshaded tanks and higher in the water column, on plates closer to the water surface. Cocconeis sublittoralis and Navicula cf. jeffreyi were cultured together to investigate competitive interactions between the two species. Throughout the experiment Navicula cf. jeffreyi was significantly higher in cell density when grown separately compared with the combined culture with C. sublittoralis. However when considering cell volume C. sublittoralis is substantially larger with a cell volume of 20,183 μm3 compared with 367 μm 3 for N. cf. jeffreyi. Thus the cell density of N. cf. jeffreyi must be around 4 times higher than C. sublittoralis to achieve similar biomass, which was only the case at the start of the experiment. Hence N. cf. jeffreyi is a pioneer species (early colonizer) whereas C. sublittoralis is likely to eventually out compete N. cf. jeffreyi. Cocconeis sublittoralis is a suitable diatom species for commercial abalone nurseries, particularly when larger photophobic juveniles (+5 mm shell length) are cultured and shading is often necessary. The percentage of protein was significantly higher in N. cf. jeffreyi in comparison with the other two species whereas A. longipes contained significantly higher percentage lipid. At a commercial scale juvenile abalone were successfully maintained on diatom diets for at least 18 wk (to ca. 8 mm in SL) after which growth slowed. All diatom species declined in density after week 18 coinciding with a drop in temperature from 20.38 ± 0.09°C at the beginning of the experiment to 16.23 ± 0.11°C. Juveniles feeding on N. cf. jeffreyi and A. longipes reached only 9.99 ± 3.52 and 9.49 ± 3.21 mm, respectively, in nursery tanks after 24 wk. The biomass of these later two species was lowest overall because of the small cell volume of N. cf. jeffreyi and low cell density of A. longipes. Shell length reached 10.71 ± 3.58 and 10.42 ± 3.71 mm in the C. sublittoralis and mixed diatom treatments, respectively. Specific growth rates and weight gain were highest in the mixed treatment and biomass was highest in this treatment from week four onwards. This indicates that differences in food biomass are more important for the growth of these animals than differences in biochemical composition.",10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[751:IOOTAL]2.0.CO;2,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34648816222
Daume S.; Davidson M.; Ryan S.; Parker F.,Comparisons of rearing systems based on algae or formulated feed for juvenile greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata),2007,Journal of Shellfish Research,26,3,729,735,,"In most commercial abalone nurseries worldwide, algal biomass grown on vertical plates becomes inadequate once juvenile abalone reach about 5 mm in shell length. At that stage animals need to be moved into a different tank system and weaned onto a formulated feed or alternative algal diets consisting of diatoms or macroalgae that can provide more biomass for the growing juveniles. Two trials were conducted to compare the growth and survival of juvenile greenlip abalone (5.9 ± 0.6 and 7.1 ± 0.1 mm in initial shell length) in two rearing systems: (1) shallower tanks with or without horizontal shelter, feeding a commercial formulated feed on horizontal surfaces; (2) deeper tanks with plate system feeding algal diets. The second experiment included two algal diets and two abalone stocking densities for one of the algal diets. The first experiment revealed that the algal diet consisting of Ulvella lens produced the best growth rates during the first 4 wk of the experiment, when juveniles reached about 9 mm in shell length and seawater temperatures averaged 20.1°C. Growth rates on the Ulvella diet declined rapidly thereafter, whereas growth rates on formulated feeds increased, coinciding with a decrease in seawater temperature to 15.2°C at the end of the experiment. The formulated feed produced high growth rates (over 75 μm day-1) once juveniles reached 7 mm in shell length. In the second experiment, the algal diet that included germlings of the green alga Ulva sp. produced the highest growth rates (105 μm day-1), indicating that Ulva sp. germlings are a suitable additional food source for juvenile greenlip abalone. Growth rates were particularly high towards the end of the experiment when seawater temperatures were above 19°C. Juveniles stocked at higher density (80 juveniles per plate) feeding on one of the algal diets showed reduced growth rates and overall lower average weight gain per individual compared with the juveniles stocked at low density and juveniles in the tank system feeding on formulated diet. In both experiments the survival was higher on the algal diets (77% to 82%) than on the formulated feed (62% to 65%). Culturing and maintaining algae for larger juveniles in the nursery system involved more labor, compared with the tank systems feeding formulated feed, suggesting that in higher labor cost countries, juveniles should be weaned onto a formulated feed as early as possible. We recommend moving animals into a tank system to feed formulated feed once they reach 7 mm in shell length. The weaning process can be delayed (e.g., to 17 mm shell length) by supplementing with macroalgal germlings if the seawater temperature is high and high mortality is expected when weaning onto formulated diets. The algal diet including Ulva sp. germlings produced particularly high growth rates when seawater temperature was above 19°C.",10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[729:CORSBO]2.0.CO;2,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34648816223

Amino acid sequence analysis showed the protein to consist of 134 amino acids and to contain three sequence repeats of ∼40 amino acids which were very similar to the well-known whey acidic protein domains of other proteins. Thenewprotein was therefore named perlwapin. In addition to the major sequence, we identified several minor variants. Atomic force microscopy was used to explore the interaction of perlwapin with calcite crystals. Monomolecular layers of calcite crystals dissolve very slowly in deionized water and recrystallize in supersaturated calcium carbonate solution. When perlwapin was dissolved in the supersaturated calcium carbonate solution, growth of the crystal was inhibited immediately. Perlwapin molecules bound tightly to distinct step edges, preventing the crystal layers from growing. Using lower concentrations of perlwapin in a saturated calcium carbonate solution, we could distinguish native, active perlwapin molecules from denaturated ones. These observations showed that perlwapin can act as a growth inhibitor for calcium carbonate crystals in saturated calcium carbonate solution. The function of perlwapin in nacre growth may be to inhibit the growth of certain crystallographic planes in the mineral phase of the polymer/mineral composite nacre. © 2006 by the Biophysical Society.",10.1529/biophysj.106.086108,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33749436106

Progress on a project to enhance the New South Wales blacklip abalone (Haliotis rubra) fishery is discussed to demonstrate that for sedentary reef invertebrates such as abalone, successful enhancement entails an understanding of recruitment and production limiting factors. These include age and size specific growth and mortality rates. These variables encompass the influence of other species within reef ecosystems, especially predators and species that compete directly with them for space, shelter and food. This discussion is also used to demonstrate that such difficult projects can be facilitated and refined using a simple bio-economic model centered on two interdependent tasks. The first is to minimize net costs per unit of additional sustainable production generated by enhancement. The second is to determine the minimum amount of additional sustainable production required to render a project cost-effective. This first task has, as expected, proven complex and its resolution protracted and expensive, requiring innovative biotechnology and a comprehensive knowledge of the natural biology of blacklip abalone. This discussion principally reflects the perspective of the direct potential beneficiaries of abalone fisheries enhancement, namely commercial and recreational fishers and does not deal extensively with wider views and interests of other stakeholders, namely relevant government agencies and NGOs and the general public.",10.2983/0730-8000(2006)25[211:IPOCFE]2.0.CO;2,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646701404

The harvested kelp is used mainly as feed for cultured Haliotis midae (abalone) on farms all along the South African South and West Coast. The effects that different harvesting methods have on the growth of sub-canopy kelps, kelp population structure and kelp recruitment were tested in a kelp bed at Bordjies Rif near Cape Town. Two 30 x 10 m sites were set up, about 100 m apart, in near monoculture stands of E. maxima. Each 30 x 10 m area was subdivided into three treatments. In treatment 1 (T1) the whole 'head' of each kelp sporophyte that reached the surface was cut off between the bulb and the primary blade ('lethal' method). In treatment 2 (T2) ('non-lethal' method), the secondary fronds of all sporophytes that reached the surface were cut 20-30 cm from their junction with the primary blade, and removed. In the control plot, the kelp plants were not treated. Harvesting treatments were done approximately every four months, at low spring tide, from 3 March 2003 to 3 November 2003 (three treatments). The effects of harvesting on the kelps depend largely on the size of plant and the time the fronds were removed; however, no seasonal pattern could be observed. The different treatments had no effect on the growth rate, population structure or recruitment of the kelp. This means that factors other than light play an important role in the growth, structure and recruitment of the kelp beds in False Bay.

Here, we use gene regulatory analysis to test between two competing paleoecological scenarios put forth to explain the evolution of complex life cycles. The first posits that early bilaterians were holobenthic, and the evolution of macrophagous grazing drove the exploitation of the pelagos by metazoan eggs and embryos, and eventually larvae. The alternative hypothesis predicts that early bilaterians were holopelagic, and new adult stages were added on when these holopelagic forms began to feed on the benthos. The former hypothesis predicts that the larvae of protostomes and deuterostomes are not homologous, with the implication that larval-specific structures, including the apical organ, are the products of convergent evolution, whereas the latter hypothesis predicts homology of larvae, specifically homology of the apical organ. We show that in the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, the transcription factors NK2.1 and HNF6 are necessary for the correct spatial expression profiles of five different cilia genes. All of these genes are expressed exclusively in the apical plate after the mesenchyme-blastula stage in cells that also express NK2.1 and HNF6. In addition, abrogation of SpNK2.1 results in embryos that lack the apical tuft. However, in the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, NK2.1 and HNF6 are not expressed in any cells that also express these same five cilia genes. Nonetheless, like the sea urchin, the gastropod expresses both NK2.1 and FoxA around the stomodeum and foregut, and FoxA around the proctodeum. As we detected no similarity in the development of the apical tuft between the sea urchin and the abalone, these molecular data are consistent with the hypothesis that the evolution of mobile, macrophagous metazoans drove the evolution of complex life cycles multiple times independently in the late Precambrian. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1525-142X.2006.00134.x,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33846035217

We characterize the first extremely acidic proteins purified from biomineralized aragonite. These abalone nacre proteins are two variants of 8.7 and 7.8 kDa designated AP8 (for aragonite proteins of approximately 8 kDa). The AP8 proteins have compositions dominated by Asx (∼35 mol %) and Gly (∼40 mol %) residues, suggesting that their structures have high Ca2+-binding capacity and backbone flexibility. The growth of asymmetrically rounded CaCO3 crystals in the presence of AP8 reveals that both proteins preferentially interact with specific locations on the crystal surface. In contrast, CaCO3 crystals grown with nacre proteins depleted of AP8 retain the morphology of unmodified calcite rhombohedra. Our observations thus identify sites of protein-mineral interaction and provide evidence to support the long-standing theory that acidic proteins are more effective crystal-modulators than other proteins from the same biomineralized material. © 2005 American Chemical Society.",10.1021/bm049314v,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-20144369544

This leads to a non-local method that may be thought of as a continuum version of molecular dynamics simulation. Any two material points are connected by a, possibly nonlinear, elastic spring (bond) with a critical stretch parameter. We present examples of dynamic fracture and damage for high-aspect ratio structures such as membranes and nanofiber networks. The membrane example captures dynamic transition from a mode III fracture to mode I. In the deformation of nanofiber networks we obtain cellular patterns of deformation when, in addition to the elastic forces along fibers or at bonded contacts between fibers, van der Waals forces are acting between the fibers. In this way we eliminate the need of modeling individual atom as required by a MD simulation. The force response across the network is similar to the response observed in rupturing of the protein adhesive in biological structure (abalone shells).",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869767318

Growth of juvenile Haliotis midae was monitored on a commercial abalone farm over a period of 9 months in an experiment consisting of 9 treatments with 4 replicates (n = 250 individuals per replicate). The treatments were: fresh kelp (Ecklonia maxima) blades (seaweed control); Abfeed® (formulated feed control); kelp + Abfeed® dried kelp pellets; dried kelp blades; dried kelp stipes; fresh kelp with the epiphyte Carpoblepharis flaccida; a mixed diet (Gracilaria gracilis, Ulva lactuca, and kelp) and a rotational diet (abalone were fed 1 of the 9 treatments for the first week and them kelp for the next 3 weeks). Results show that abalone grow well on all fresh seaweed combinations, but grow best on a mixed diet. The likely reason for the success of the mixed diet is that the red and green seaweed was farm grown, with an increased protein content. Dried kelp in any form produced poor growth. Abalone fed on the mixed diet grew at 0.066 mm day-1 shell length and 0.074 g day-1 body weight; this corresponds to 24.09 mm shell length and 27.01 g body weight increase per annum. Abalone fed on dried kelp grew at only 0.029 mm day-1 shell length and of 0.021 g day-1 body weight. Abalone grown on Abfeed® grew at 0.049 mm day-1 shell length and 0.046 g day-1 body weight which corresponds to 17.88 mm and 16.79 g increase per annum; this is better than the dried seaweed feeds, but poorer than the fresh seaweed combinations. This study shows that seaweed diets, particularly if the diets include seaweeds grown in animal aquaculture effluent, are good substitutes for the formulated feed generally used today. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",10.1007/s10811-006-9045-7,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845388475

Cultures were carried out in lantern and basket nets suspended in seawater tanks having a constant flow of fresh seawater from La Herradura Bay. A total of 900 juveniles were observed, starting with individuals having an average length of 20 mm. The abalone juveniles were fed with two species of macroalgae, half of which was Gracilaria chilensis, and the other was half Ulva sp (mass basis), fed ad libitum. Artificial pelletized food was fed as a supplement, at a rate of 2% of the body mass of the abalones daily. Water quality in the cultures was monitored twice daily, included water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and water flow rate. The average survival of the abalones at the termination of the experimental period was 96.2% in the lantern nets, and 94.6% in the culture baskets, although these differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05; nested ANOVA). The highest mean specific growth rates were obtained in the lantern net systems with rates of 0.34% per day in length and 1.02% per day in weight; comparative values for the basket systems were 0.31% per day and 0.86% per day. Higher growth rates for weight and length of the shell were obtained in the lantern systems than in the basket culture systems. An analysis of covariance of values for growth in weight and length of the abalones showed significant differences between results from the lantern and basket systems (P < 0.05). Based on the results of the study, the lantern systems should be considered as an interesting alternative for the culture of Haliotis discus hannai both in land-based cultures, and at sea, because they have a larger carrying capacity for abalones compared with the baskets in the culture tanks and only occupy one third of the water column space.

This research integrated a simulated digestion protocol with ultrafiltration and cartilage explants to generate new information on the anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective properties of NZGLM, SC, and AB. Each nutraceutical was artificially digested using simulated gastric and intestinal fluids, and the crude digest was ultrafiltered (50 kDa). Each filtrate was applied individually to cartilage explants before the explants were stimulated with IL-1 to induce an acute inflammatory response. Media were collected daily for 48 h and analyzed for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), glycosaminoglycan (GAG), and nitric oxide (NO), and cartilage tissue was differentially stained to determine the relative proportion of live and dead cells. SC and NZGLM significantly inhibited IL-1-induced PGE2 synthesis and IL-1-induced GAG release, and AB was an effective inhibitor of IL-1-induced NO production.

To determine if a candidate aquaculture species, Haliotis kamtschatkana, exhibits density-dependent growth we raised animals at three density levels and two food treatments: unlimited (ad libitum) and rationed (individual portions were the same among density treatments). We also tested for differences in food consumption, foraging patterns and stacking behaviour among the density levels. We observed density-dependent growth in the rationed treatments, indicating that relatively high growth rates at lower densities are driven, in part, by factors other than differences in food consumption. However, overall the quantity of food consumed related directly to growth; treatments fed ad libitum had higher growth rates. Furthermore, even when food was provided in excess, foraging was restricted to ~ 2 h after sunset in all treatments and the amount consumed per abalone was significantly lower at high densities. This is probably because high density animals could not access the food provided: fewer were observed foraging and they had to move from prominent stacks. Our results indicate that both temporal and spatial access to food are critical and that managers can observe foraging and stacking by abalone in tanks to determine if a specific design will limit food consumption, and ultimately growth. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The content of the essential fatty acid 20:5n-3 (EPA) was highest among the PUFAs and higher, though not significantly, in the two diatom species A. luciae and N. cf. lenzii that produced the better results. Among the free amino acids, arginine was dominant in N. laevis, proline in N. cf. lenzii, and both free amino acids plus glutamic acid were equally dominant in A. luciae. The suitability of A. luciae and N. cf. lenzii for enhancing growth and survival of postlarvae was attributed to their complementary balanced nutritional properties. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Muraoka D.,"Eisenia bicyclis bed coverage off Oshika Peninsula, Japan, in relation to sporophyte survival and Strongylocentrotus nudus abundance",2008,Journal of Applied Phycology,20,5,845,851,,"It has recently been reported that the Eisenia bicyclis beds on the coast of Tomarihama in the Oshika Peninsula in Miyagi Prefecture (northern part of Japan) have been progressively receding from the offshore side of the beds every year. In this study, to determine the factors causing the change in the distribution of E. bicyclis beds as well as the extent of the change, an ecological survey of E. bicyclis and grazing animals was conducted. A 150 m-long fixed line was set up in the rocky coastal area on the Oshika Peninsula in Miyagi Prefecture, and the number of E. bicyclis individuals inhabiting a 1-m width was then measured. In addition, the numbers of individuals of sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus nudus) and abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) were measured. Although the E. bicyclis bed extended to the 64-m point on the fixed line at the time of the survey in August 1999, by July 2001, its lower limit was at the 53-m point; thus, a retreat of the outer edge of the bed of 11 m was observed in 2 years. The density of adult E. bicyclis sporophytes in the bed was reduced from 1.08 to 1.80 individuals (ind.) m-2, respectively. Juvenile sporophytes were also observed, but most of those that had settled near the lower limit of the bed failed to survive to become adult sporophytes. There were few sea urchins, the main grazing animal on the site, inside the E. bicyclis bed (3.5 ind. m-2 in October 2001) while there were many near the bed lower limit and on the deep-site side (12.9 ind. m-2 in October 2001). These results indicate that the high grazing pressure of sea urchins reduced the survival of juvenile sporophytes near the bed lower limit, thus impeding the recruitment of juvenile sporophytes to replace adult sporophytes that died due to senescence, storm action and/or grazing. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",10.1007/s10811-008-9337-1,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149240021

The estimates were calculated from shell length and shell width measurements on progeny resulting from 12 half-sib families and 36 full-sib families obtained using artificial fertilization of mating three females to each male. The measurements were taken at 10, 20 and 30 d after fertilization. It was found that heritability estimates based on sire component ranged from 0. 23 to 0. 36 for shell length and 0. 21 to 0. 32 for shell width. Heritability estimates from dam component were larger than those from sire component at three ages, indicating presence of maternal effects, non-additive genetic effects and common environmental effects. Phenotypic correlations were significant at three ages (P < 0. 05), with values of 0. 92, 0. 93 and 0. 92, respectively. Genetic correlations from the paternal half-sib correlation analysis were highly positive at three ages, with values of 0. 50, 0. 78 and 0. 81, respectively. The results suggest that selective breeding is an effective approach to improving growth traits of Pacific abalone stocks.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-37349072451

This study compared the pathologic changes that occur during the progression of WS in red abalone to those caused by environmental stresses consisting of elevated temperature and food limitation and determined the impact of these stressors on WS prevalence and intensity. Farmed red abalone were administered a feed-based oxytetracycline therapeutic treatment to assure WS-RLP-free status prior to initiation of the experiment. Groups were then held in each of eight combinations of exposed vs. unexposed to WS-RLP, elevated vs. ambient temperature, and high vs. low food supply, for 447 days. Mortality was associated with starvation and disease but not elevated temperature alone. Elevated temperature significantly affected WS-RLP transmission: only 1.7% of WS-RLP- exposed abalone held at ambient temperature (12.3°C) became infected compared to at least 72% of those held at elevated temperature (18.7°C). Among exposed abalone at elevated temperature, fed animals exhibited greater infection prevalence but not greater infection intensity or digestive gland changes than starved animals, suggesting that abalone acquire infections by ingesting contaminated food. Food, temperature, WS-RLP exposure, and most of their interactions had significant effects on body condition and foot atrophy. Immunohistochemical detection of cell proliferation and apoptosis revealed no differences between normal digestive gland and that infected with WS-RLP. Body mass shrinkage, foot atrophy, elevated mortality, and decreased foot and digestive gland glycogen were observed in both WS-affected and starved, unexposed abalone, with the WS-RLP-exposed, starved group held at elevated temperature faring worst. Among exposed and unexposed animals, food supply but not temperature affected body mass and growth. These data demonstrate that the high morbidity and mortality exhibited by WS-RLP-infected abalone is a consequence of disease and not direct thermal stress. Drug residue analysis indicated oxytetracycline concentrations of up to 600 ppm in the digestive gland at 38 days post-treatment, an unusual degree of tissue retention of this therapeutant. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This represents an increase of over 13% from the 152,088 t landed in 2006, and a 32% decline from the peak landings of 252,568 t in 2000. The preliminary ex-vessel economic value of commercial landings in 2007 was nearly $120 million, a decrease of 8% from the $130 million in 2006. Pacific sardine was by far the largest volume fishery in the state at nearly 81,000 t, but third in ex-vessel value at $8.2 million.Market squid was second in landings at over 49,000 t, and was the highest valued fishery in the state at $29.1 million. The other top-five volume fisheries included northern anchovy at 10,400 t, red sea urchin at 5,050 t, and Pacific mackerel at 5,018 t. The ex-vessel value of Dungeness crab dropped to second in 2007 at $26.8 million, a decline of 85% from the record annual harvest in 2006. The other top-five valued fisheries include Pacific Chinook salmon at nearly $7.8 million, California spiny lobster at nearly $6.9 million, and red sea urchin at $5.0 million. Dungeness crab landings for 2007 dropped to less than 5,000 t, a 58% decline from the record landings for 2006. Historically, the fishery peaks in a ten-year cycle.Commercial landings for California spiny lobster also declined to 300 t, a 26% decline from 2006. Starting in 2008, recreational lobster fishermen will need to carry and complete a Spiny Lobster Report Card which will be used to track recreational catch and effort. For highly migratory species, commercial and recreational landings of albacore in California increased over 300%, although landings along the entire West Coast were down in 2007. Landings of all other tuna species increased slightly with the exception of skipjack. Landings of swordfish increased 46% over 2006. In 2007, the California Fish and Game Commission (Commission) adopted bag limits for both albacore and bluefin tuna consistent with federal regulations. In 2007, California ocean salmon fisheries were less constrained than in 2006 due to a higher forecasted abundance of Klamath River Fall Chinook (KRFC). Commercial fisheries had 141 more days open than in 2006. Estimated total commercial landings were 113,400 Chinook (686 t),which was the second lowest catch on record; however, this was still a 45% increase in weight compared to 2006 (lowest catch on record).Recreational fisheries had 90 more days open than in 2006. Estimated total recreational landings were 47,600 Chinook. This is the lowest catch on record and a 51% decrease compared to 2006. Estimated effort was 105,700 angler days, a 16% decrease from 2006.The catch per unit effort was 0.5 fish per angler, a 41% decrease from 2006. California's commercial groundfish harvest for 2007 was over 10,000 t, a 13% decrease over 2006 landings. Pacific whiting, Dover sole, and sablefish continued to be the top species landed.The ex-vessel value of groundfish landings for 2007 was $15.9 million, 8% higher than in 2006.The first stock assessment for blue rockfish was completed in 2007. For California halibut, new regulations have closed portions of the traditional halibut trawl grounds and implemented a restricted access program which has resulted in a decrease in landings from a peak of 596 t in 1999 to a low of 174 t in 2007. Pacific hagfish landings in California increased ten-fold from 77 t in 2006 to 773 t in 2007, the result of increased demand in South Korean markets for human consumption. Pacific herring landings in California dropped to the second lowest level in the 35-year history of the fishery, thought to be the result of a decrease in length at age of the fish and increased competition from other herring fisheries world-wide. Over 541,000 recreational anglers caught nearly 2.7 million fish and invertebrates aboard Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessels (CPFVs) in California in 2007, a 10% decline from the 3.0 million landed in 2006. Rockfishes (all species combined), kelp bass, and California scorpionfish, barred sandbass, and California barracuda were the top species landed. In 2007, the Commission undertook 14 rule-making actions that address marine and anadromous species.The Commission adopted changes to albacore, bluefin tuna, salmon, groundfish, sea urchin, abalone, herring, and rock crab regulations and added the recreational Spiny Lobster Report Card. The Commission also established 15 marine protected areas (528 square kilometers, 204 square .Figure Present. miles) in central California from Pigeon Point in San Mateo County south to Point Conception in Santa Barbara County, and approved the establishment of federal marine protected areas adjacent to the previously established Channel Islands marine protected areas under the Marine Life Protection Act. In addition, the Commission was petitioned to increase protections for two anadromous Osmerids: to uplist the delta smelt from threatened to endangered and to list the longfin smelt as endangered.",,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76249118206

It is the major species of Gracilaria that is commonly cultivated and consumed in Taiwan. Effects of environmental factors on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in the seaweed G. tenuistipitata were investigated in this study. PGE2 amount increased nearly 2-fold and 47% when the seaweed was exposed to two ways of fluctuation of seawater salinity from 2% to 1% and 3% for 12 hr, respectively. The stresses of low temperature and irradiance promoted the seaweed to produce PGE2. When the seaweeds were exposed to air for 2 hr and 4 hr, the PGE2 levels were elevated by 25% and 31%, respectively. When the seaweed was soaked in freshwater, PGE2 amount gradually decreased. Cu2+ and Zn2+ inhibited PGE2 production at the concentrations of 3 and 50 mg/L, respectively. Mg2+ slightly inhibited PGE2 production about 20% at 2,025 mg/L, while Ca2+ boosted PGE2 production about 59% at 600 mg/L. Hence, environmental factors significantly affect the PGE2 production in the seaweed G. tenuistipitata. Prostaglandins might be associated with processes permitting the algae tissue to survive in unfavorable conditions. To lower the amount of PGE2 in the seaweed and ensure the food safety, it is suggested to minimize the variation of growth condition to avoid PGE2 increase in the seaweed during cultivation period. In addition, consumers should avoid eating raw seaweed since PGE2 could be destroyed by heating.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-50449088387

WS-RLP infection is not sufficient to cause withering syndrome, and for reasons not yet well understood additional stressors such as elevated water temperature appear to influence disease development. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based metabolomics, we have investigated the influence of food availability, temperature, and bacterial infection, both individually and in combination, on the metabolic status of the red abalone. Food limitation caused dramatic reductions in all observed classes of foot muscle metabolites, while at the same time metabolite levels within the digestive gland were preserved or increased. We also found that food limitation in combination with elevated temperature led to greater metabolic perturbations in both tissue types than those observed under food limitation alone. WS-RLP infection and food-limitation resulted in many of the same metabolic changes within the tissues studied, although the effects of infection were less severe. We observed increased levels of homarine in the digestive gland of both food-limited and WS-RLP-infected animals, yet only observed increased homarine levels in the foot muscle of infected abalone. These results further support the recently established glucose-to-homarine ratio in foot muscle as a potential marker for differentiating WS-RLP-infected animals from those of both healthy and food limited abalone. Furthermore, we found that the NMR metabolic data correlates well with histological measurements supporting the use of the metabolomics approach for characterizing both normal and pathological events in marine species, particularly during periods of environmentally relevant stress. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",10.1007/s11306-005-4428-3,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-20344397404
Francis T.L.; Maneveldt G.W.; Venter J.,Determining the most appropriate feeding regime for the South African abalone Haliotis midae Linnaeus grown on kelp,2008,Journal of Applied Phycology,20,5,597,602,,"Beach-cast kelp (the most widely used feed for commercially grown South African abalone) is plentiful during winter months when periodic storms cause kelp to wash ashore. During summer, however, this resource is not always readily available and farmed abalone are often starved for short periods. The aim of this research was to assess how periodic kelp starvation influences growth of the commercially grown abalone, Haliotis midae Linnaeus. Growth of grow-out abalone was monitored on a commercial abalone farm over a period of six months and consisted of 3 treatments with 2 replicates (n = ±250 abalone per replicate). The treatments were: Control (abalone always given more kelp than what they typically needed); Treatment 1 (abalone fed their weekly ration only once a week); Treatment 2 (abalone fed half their weekly ration every 3 and then 4 days respectively). While the data at first suggest that the control animals outperform the treatment animals, after undergoing an initial adjustment period to the new feeding regime, the treatment animals perform better. Weight gain and feed conversion efficiencies show that the treatment animals perform better overall. The control animals generally required much more feed to produce comparable increases in both length and weight compared to the treatment animals. This study has shown that periodic bouts of starvation is beneficial to Haliotis midae, allowing variable growth spurts when returned to full feed rations. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",10.1007/s10811-007-9266-4,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149231447
Boyd C.E.; McNevin A.A.; Clay J.; Johnson H.M.,Certification issues for some common aquaculture species,2005,Reviews in Fisheries Science,13,4,231,279,,"There is interest in certification of aquaculture production facilities in response to concerns about negative environmental and social impacts and food safety. This study identifies issues to be considered by stakeholders in developing certification standards for channel catfish, tilapias, rainbow trout, oysters, mussels, clams, scallops, abalone, and seaweed. Common issues include land and water use, water pollution, benthic effects, effects on biodiversity, use of antibiotics and other chemicals, and relationships with workers and local communities. Specific, contentious issues apply to individual species or species groups. Fish meal use in feeds will be a major concern in finfish certification. Use of groundwater, removal of daily mortalities, and medicated feed in channel catfish culture should be given particular attention. Tilapia culture can introduce these species into watersheds where they have not previously occurred, resulting in serious competition with native species. Some environmentalists and consumers object to hormone treatment of tilapia to produce all male fry. Widespread use of therapeutic agents in trout culture will be a major concern. Discussions of shellfish certification should focus on water use conflicts and public health risks associated with the consumption of these organisms. The introduction of non-native species and genetic alterations with respect to oysters also will need to be addressed. Further, introduction of non-native species should be a major topic in discussions of abalone and seaweed culture. The source of wild seaweed to use as food in abalone culture also will be an issue.

The experiment included 10 diet treatments with two replicates each (n = 50 individuals per replicate). The first five diet treatments comprised four fishmeal-based formulated feeds: Abfeed®, Adam & Amos® 'a', Adam & Amos® 'b' and Adam & Amos® 'c'; and an all-seaweed-based formulated pellet, FeedX. The additional five diet treatments comprised the formulated feeds above, supplemented with fresh wild seaweeds: the kelp Ecklonia maxima (5-15% protein) and Ulva lactuca (3.7-19.9% protein). The fishmeal-based protein feeds produced significantly better growth than the all-seaweed-based protein feed (FeedX: 0.49 ± 0.03 specific growth rate [SGR]; 27.15 ± 0.02 daily increment increase in shell length [DISL]; 0.864 final condition factor [CF]). Abfeed® (1.00 ± 0.02 SGR; 60.79 ± 0.04 DISL; 1.312 final CF) performed best of all the formulated feeds. Supplementation with fresh, wild seaweed, however, significantly improved growth of all abalone with supplemented Abfeed® (1.05 ± 0.02 SGR; 63.61 ± 0.05 DISL; 1.447 final CF), outperforming all supplemented feeds. A noteworthy observation was that the condition factor of abalone fed the feed that performed particularly poorly in the growth trials (FeedX) was dramatically improved by supplementation. It was shown that supplementation with fresh wild seaweed enhances the growth of abalone reared on formulated feeds.

The minimal nutrient concentration resulting in significant enrichment of U. rigida was 2.25 mg N 1-1. The maximum nitrogen content obtained by U. rigida in this study was 6.099%, which resulted from an inorganic nutrient concentration of 7 mg N 1-1'. However, no further significant increase in enrichment occurred from nutrient concentrations of 10 and 15 mg N 1-1. Abalone specific growth rate in shell length (SGRL) and wet weight (SGR L) and foot muscle yield were significantly higher for abalone fed the artificial diet compared to those fed any U. rigida diet. Abalone fed U. rigida enriched in less than 15 mg N 1-1 had similar growth rates compared to abalone fed unenriched U. rigida. Abalone fed the artificial diet contributed a higher percentage of weight gain into the valuable foot muscle. The foot muscle moisture content of abalone fed the artificial diet was significantly lower than that of abalone fed any U. rigida diet. The conclusions reached by this study should assist Australian abalone producers in assessing the potential benefits of using U. rigida as an effluent biofilter and subsequent food source for the commercially important juvenile greenlip abalone. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",10.1023/B:AQUI.0000042138.14961.c2,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646692388

Growth and fatty acid composition of the muscle tissue were compared to that of abalone fed a reference diet that contained no added lipids (0.25% total lipids). After 75 days of culture in a flow-through system, no significant differences in growth were found among abalone fed the different oil types. Responses to different dietary levels of lipid were significantly different but not to sources of oils. Maximum growth was achieved at a 1.5% inclusion of oil sources. It appears that abalone have a great capacity to synthesize lipid from carbohydrate sources. Results also suggest that abalone are capable of desaturation and elongation of 18 C polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of the n - 3 and n - 6 family to 20:5n - 3 and 20:4n - 6. Synthesis of 22:6n - 3 from 20:5n - 3 is not reflected in the results. The lack of a growth response to the different levels of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) provided by the different oils included in the experimental diets may be due to an insufficient duration of the experiment to achieve an essential fatty acid deficiency. The relationship between fatty acid profiles of tissue and the diets fed to the abalone suggests that metabolic activity of the gut microflora is not a source of essential fatty acids. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Roberts R.D.; Lapworth C.; Barker R.J.,Effect of starvation on the growth and survival of post-larval abalone (Haliotis iris),2001,Aquaculture,200,3-Apr,323,338,,"The starvation tolerance of post-larval abalone (Haliotis iris) was determined by examining post-larval growth and survival after various periods of starvation. Competent larvae (10 days old at 16°C) were induced to attach and metamorphose with 2 μM GABA. Post-larvae were either fed diatoms (Nitzschia longissima) or starved. In Experiment 1, post-larvae were starved immediately after metamorphosis for periods of 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 20, 25 and 30 days. Starved post-larvae grew relatively well for several days after metamorphosis despite the absence of food (averages of 10.4 and 17.8 μm shell length (SL) per day after 8 days for two batches). Subsequent growth was minimal, averaging 1.7 and 0.7 μm day-1 over 6-7 days for the two batches. There was no clear relationship between period of starvation and growth rate when fed. Mean daily growth rate over 3 weeks when fed ranged from ∼ 15-22 μm day-1. However, the duration of starvation did have a significant effect on survival. Survival of post-larvae fed after 1-2 days of starvation was 90-100% after 3 weeks of feeding. Longer starvation periods gave progressively lower survival and post-larvae starved for 30 days all died within a week of being fed. In Experiment 2, post larvae were fed for 3 weeks after metamorphosis, then starved for 0, 3, 7, 14 or 21 days. Growth rates of starved post-larvae averaged only 5-6 μm day-1 in the first week (vs. 30 μm day-1 in controls), and later declined to zero. Growth resumed within a week following return to food, but the 14- and 21-day starvation treatments took 2 weeks to reach growth rates comparable to controls. The no-starvation controls and the 3- and 7-day starvation treatments all had > 70% survival over 4 weeks after return to food. Survival in the 14- and 21-day starvation treatments was 15-20%, with almost all mortalities occurring in the first week after return to food. These data suggest that Haliotis iris post-larvae are relatively tolerant of starvation, so abalone farmers have a week or so to remedy food shortages before major post-larval mortality begins. © 20001 Elsevier B.V.

This growth should use technologies with economical and environmental sustainability. Feed accounts for about half the cost in current high-volume fed mono-species aquaculture, mainly fish net pens or shrimp/fish ponds, yet most of this feed becomes waste. The resulting environmental impact and rising feed costs therefore hamper further growth of such farms. As in certain traditional polyculture schemes, plants can drastically reduce feed use and environmental impact of industrialized mariculture and at the same time add to its income. These nutrient-assimilating photoautotrophic plants use solar energy to turn nutrient-rich effluents into profitable resources. Plants counteract the environmental effects of the heterotrophic fed fish and shrimp and restore water quality. Today's integrated intensive aquaculture approaches, developed from traditional extensive polyculture, integrate the culture of fish or shrimp with vegetables, microalgae, shellfish and/or seaweeds. Integrated mariculture can take place in coastal waters or in ponds and can be highly intensified. Today's technologies are well studied and documented. They are generic, modular and adaptable for several culture combinations of fish, shrimp, shellfish, abalone, sea urchin and several species of commercially important seaweeds and vegetables. A 1-ha land-based integrated seabream-shellfish-seaweed farm can produce 25 tons of fish, 50 tons of bivalves and 30 tons fresh weight of seaweeds annually. Another farm model can produce in 1 ha 55 tons of seabream or 92 tons of salmon, with 385 or 500 fresh weight of seaweed, respectively, without pollution. Preliminary calculations show a potential for high profitability with large integrated farms. Several freshwater integrated fish-vegetable farms and a couple of modern fish-algae-shellfish/abalone integrated mariculture farms exist today, and several additional farms are planned. Three major international R&D projects promise to soon expand the horizons of the technology further. Therefore, modern integrated systems in general, and seaweed-based systems in particular, are bound to play a major role in the sustainable expansion of world aquaculture. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Concentrations of Cd and Pb, two non-essential metals, in the muscles of abalones decreased as the organisms became older. In addition, no significant difference was apparent in Cu, Mn, and Zn concentrations, three essential metals, with increases in shell length (age), although a close negative linear relationship with growth was observed in Zn in one habitat. These results indicate that abalone has an ability to differentiate those metals and develops this ability as the organism became older.

Hence, the aim of the present work is to study the possibility of replacing kelp meal in the abalone diet with a regional winery by-product. Five diets were formulated in which kelp meal was substituted from 0% to 100%, at a maximum of 33% of the total of ingredients; 375 abalone (15.09 ± 0.38 mm and 0.434 ± 0.03 g) were used, randomly distributed in fifteen 8-L plastic buckets. After 60 days of experimentation, significant differences were detected in the slopes of the different treatments for both length and weight. Since the inclusion of the winery by-product resulted in a lower feed ingestion but the feed conversion efficiency remained constant, a factor of low palatability can be attributed to the winery by-product and not an antinutritional factor. It is concluded that the winery by-product can be substituted for kelp meal in 16% of the total diet without having a negative effect on the growth of the organisms.",10.7773/cm.v30i12.105,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-2342437292
Huchette S.M.H.; Koh C.S.; Day R.W.,The effects of density on the behaviour and growth of juvenile blacklip abalone (Haliotis rubra),2003,Aquaculture International,11,5,411,428,,The growth of juvenile abalone in aquaculture is known to be affected by density as a result of competition for food and decreases in water quality. Our results suggest that behaviour is also affected by density and this also has a significant impact on the growth of individual abalone. 1800 juveniles of Haliotis rubra were individually tagged and reared for 5 months in 12 gravity-fed tanks at two levels of density. The experimental design allowed the differentiation of the direct from the indirect effects of density. The abalone growth and distribution was monitored monthly along with the water quality. The distribution of abalone during daytime was closely related to the availability of preferred shelter space. The percentage of abalone stacked on the top of others increased with density. Preferred shelter space was characterized by low light intensity and a corner or edge for the abalone to rest against. Hides at the ends of the tanks were not occupied as much as others. Abalone were found crawling on the side of the tank during daytime when tanks were shaded. Abalone juveniles of 15-60 mm showed fidelity to their resting shelter during daytime but this fidelity was significantly reduced at the higher density. Shading of the tanks totally changed the distribution of the abalone and their daytime behaviour. Competition for shelter space reduced growth more than water quality.,10.1023/B:AQUI.0000004194.85299.38,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0346039110
Marte C.L.,Larviculture of marine species in Southeast Asia: Current research and industry prospects,2003,Aquaculture,227,1-Apr,293,304,,"The increased requirement for food fish, the lucrative market for expensive seafood, and the need to conserve marine resources, have motivated the rapid pace of larviculture research in Southeast Asia. Various research and academic institutions in Southeast Asia such as the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center Aquaculture Department (SEAFDEC AQD) are carrying out research on commercially important marine species including 10 fish, 6 crustacean, and 7 mollusk species. Since fry availability is a major constraint in the development of culture systems, a major research thrust of SEAFDEC AQD is the development of commercially viable technologies for breeding and seed production of commercially important marine fish and crustaceans such as milkfish, groupers, snappers and mud crabs, in addition to the production of fry and juveniles of endangered and depleted species such as the sea horse and the tropical abalone for stock enhancement and sea ranching. Although hatchery production of milkfish and sea bass are now commercially viable enterprises, research is being pursued to improve fry quality through feed supplementation and to lower production cost by using alternative live or artificial feeds. Larviculture techniques are being developed for technically demanding species such as groupers and snappers. The recent success in larviculture of the mud crab Scylla serrata is expected to stimulate the growth of the mud crab industry in the region. Similarly, encouraging developments in the breeding and larviculture of the sea horse and mollusks such as the tropical abalone will provide the necessary support to carry out future stock enhancement and sea ranching programs for these species. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The preliminary exvessel economic value of California commercial landings in 2001 was $104 million, a decrease of 22% from $133 million in 2000. Two of the top three grossing fisheries in the state were invertebrate fisheries, as was the case in 2000. The top three fisheries for 2001 (excluding kelp) in ex-vessel value were market squid ($17.5 million), groundfish ($16 million), and red sea urchin ($11.5 million). These fisheries all decreased in value in 2001 compared with 2000: squid declined 35%, groundfish declined 20%, and sea urchin declined 11.5%, continuing its downward trend since its historic high in 1988. The Dungeness crab fishery, with landings significantly lower than the ten-year mean, fell from the list of the top three fisheries and was valued at $8.9 million in 2000. The swordfish fishery, worth $8.6 million in 2001, was the fifth most valuable fishery in the state, recovering slightly from the low in 1998. Ridgeback prawn decreased 76% in 2001 from its 20-year high in 2000, and spot prawn continued its downward trend from the high set in 1998. White abalone was listed as endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) in May 2001, making it the first marine invertebrate to be listed. A recovery plan is currently being drafted. Revenue generated from kelp harvesting in 2001 was worth an estimated $19 million, after production, to the major harvester and producer of algin products, ISP Alginates; revenue was down from the $40 million reported in 2000 due to the weakening in the U.S. economy in 2001, intense competition from foreign algin producers, and ISP's decision to shift production to its facility in Scotland. Management authority over coastal pelagic species (Pacific sardine, Pacific mackerel, northern anchovy, and jack mackerel) was transferred from state agencies in California, Oregon, and Washington to the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in January 2000. Landings of Pacific sardine remained high in 2001, with an increase in ex-vessel value per metric ton. Only 56% of the sardine harvest guideline was caught in 2001. Pacific mackerel landings fell to 7,000 t in 2001, as did landings in Baja California, Mexico. The fishery was closed in March when the harvest guideline was met. Anchovy landings increased substantially in 2001 to 19,000 t, up 37% from 2000. Landings in the commercial groundfish fishery were less than 12,000 t in 2001, a 67% decrease compared with ten years ago and a 28% decrease compared with last year. The groundfish harvest was again dominated by the Dover sole, thornyhead, sablefish (DTS) complex, which declined substantially compared with 2000. Stock assessments prepared for the DTS complex show a lack of sablefish recruitment over the past decade. Rockfish landings were also down in 2001; 2,401 t were landed in 2001 compared with 3,238 t in 2000, a decline of 26%, and a decline of 83% compared with 1991. As a result of stock assessments in 2000, widow rockfish and darkblotched rockfish were added to the list of groundfishes declared ""overfished""; already on the list are lingcod, bocaccio, Pacific ocean perch, and some rockfishes. The nearshore finfish fishery landed 447 t statewide in 2001, well below the 1997 peak in the fishery of 947 t. The live-fish landings component was 307 t, 69% of the overall nearshore catch. In 2001, the ex-vessel value for live-fish landings was approximately $2.8 million, about 17.5% of the value of the groundfish fishery (nearshore and offshore) and a greater proportion of the fishery's value than in the previous year. 2001 was the second consecutive year PFMC implemented two-month fishery closures for all nearshore rockfishes (winter closure south of Monterey and spring closure north of Monterey; no closure north of Cape Mendocino). During the rockfish closures, fishing effort for the live- fish market shifted to other species in some areas, such as surfperch in the San Francisco area. Recreational finfish landings increased by 5%, to 3,073,793 individual fish caught by 682,019 anglers aboard commercial passenger fishing vessels (CPFVs) in 2001. Southern California CPFV landings comprised 83% of the statewide total, the same as in 2000. Commercial salmon fishers landed more than 1,012 t of chinook salmon, a six-fold decrease from the 20-year high set in 1988. Recreational anglers landed 97,000 chinook salmon from the ocean in 2001, a decline of 48% from the previous year. The coho salmon fishery remained closed. Commercial and recreational landings of white seabass reached an all-time high in 2001: commercial fishers landed more than 120 t, and recreational anglers landed more than 38,000 fish. The Marine Life Management Act provides that fishery management plans (FMPs) shall form the basis for managing California's marine fisheries. A major component of the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) Marine Region's work in 2001 was to draft these plans as well as to amend existing plans, such as the Coastal Pelagic Species FMP (finfishes only), which set a capacity goal for the limited-entry fleet. The California Fish and Game Commission is expected to adopt three more FMPs in 2002 - for nearshore fishes, abalone, and squid. As part of the FMP drafting process, CDFG held numerous workshops to facilitate constituent input into the process. Furthermore, CDFG has partnered with PFMC and others to develop the preliminary FMP for West Coast highly migratory species. In 2001 the California Fish and Game Commission undertook 25 rule-making actions that address marine and anadromous species. In May 2001 the emergency closure of the gill-net fishery in shallow waters (<60 fathoms deep) off the central California coast was upheld, continuing the prohibition established in September 2000 to protect the common murre and the southern sea otter. In addition to the regulatory actions, the commission also received extensive oral and written testimony from the public. In response to comments received regarding Initial Draft Concepts for Marine Protected Areas within California state waters in July 2001, a new process was launched late in the year.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038148673

This worm is endemic to South Africa and the locally cultured abalone, Haliotis midae, are under constant threat of infestation. An understanding of factors that influence abalone growth and sabellid infestation levels under intensive culture conditions is therefore imperative to controlling infestation levels. Abalone were held on an abalone farm at stocking densities of 18%, 23% and 28% of the surface area available to the abalone. They were fed kelp or a pelleted diet, Abfeed™. Their growth and infestation levels were monitored for 14 months. Within the range of abalone sizes used for this study kelp-fed abalone grew significantly better than Abfeed™-fed abalone (F1,197=7.99; P≤0.005), while stocking density had no effect (F2,196=1.41; P≤0.246) on growth. Abalone that became infested grew at the same rate as those that did not (0.09≤P≤1). No growth-limiting effect of infestation was detected. There was no effect on total intensity (i.e., the total number of worms per sample of 60 abalone; 0.41≤P≤1 and 0.17≤P≤1), or prevalence (i.e., the percentage of infected abalone within a sample; 0.50≤P≤1 and 0.19≤P≤1) of infestation by diet and stocking density, respectively. There was a significant positive coefficient of correlation of 86.2% between the level at which an increase in total intensity starts, and the average increase in total intensity per day (F1,10=62.2; P≤0.0001). A regression model is presented to estimate total intensity based on prevalence. The greatest increase in total intensity levels coincided with the onset of spring, and a possible seasonal component to the reproduction of this sabellid is discussed. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

All strains were within the size range ingested by most filter feeders, i.e. 3-10 μm. Cellular growth rates of aerated 1.6-1 cultures ranged from 0.5-0.7 divisions·day-1 (Papiliocellulus simplex CS-431, Nitzschia cf paleacea CS-433) to 1.7-2.0 divisions·day-1 (Attheya septentrionalis CS-425, Entomoneis cf punctulata CS-426, Extubocellulus spinifera CS-428, Thalassiosira oceanica CS-427). The latter four strains were also rich in energy storage fractions (carbohydrate and/or lipid), especially as cultures progressed to stationary phase. Based on the initial screening, A. septentrionalis, E. cf punctulata, E. spinifera and T. oceanica were assessed as to their food value for juvenile Pacific oysters. The diatoms were fed as part of a mixed diet - each making up 70-83% of the total dry weight - together with an equal mixture of the haptophytes Pavlova lutheri and Isochrysis sp. (T. ISO) over a 21-day experiment. Diets containing A. septentrionalis and E. cf punctulata were the most effective, producing growth rates (k=0.050 day-1) marginally inferior to a similar (reference) diet containing a commonly used aquaculture diatom strain of high nutritional value, T. pseudonana CCMP 1335 (k=0.055 day-1). Regression analysis showed that oyster growth rate was correlated with the content of protein in the equal ration algal diets. We have shown A. septentrionalis and E. cf punctulata to be alternative Australian strains with good nutritional value that could be utilised by oyster hatcheries or nurseries. These strains, and others isolated in the study with different characteristics such as benthic growth or high protein levels, could also prove useful feed species for other animal species grown in aquaculture such as abalone and scallops. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Juvenile abalone (20-40 mm SL) were collected from reef platforms off the Perth (Western Australia) metropolitan area and assigned to one of seven different dietary treatments. All diets were fed ad libitum (3% bw day -1) every second day, and growth rates were quantified over a 3-mo period. Specific growth rate (SGR) for both shell length and whole body weight indicated that growth of abalone fed enriched U. rigida was not significantly different (P > 0.05) to growth achieved from the best performing artificial diets. A 96-h salinity stress test was also conducted on all treatments to assess the effects of diet on stress resistance. Diet significantly effected survival at 20%, with the U. rigida fed animals exhibiting decreased tolerance to hypo-osmotic conditions (P < 0.05). This may have been caused by an interference with the cell volume regulatory mechanisms normally utilized by Haliotis spp. Enrichment of wild U. rigida increased the algal protein content from 11.4 ± 2% (dry weight) to 32.2 ± 1.5%, perhaps partially explaining the difference in performance between this and other abalone feed trials utilizing Ulva spp. Results indicate that enriched U. rigida is a suitable feed for H. roei, providing similar growth to that achieved from several commercially available diets.",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035717348
Tegner M.J.; Haaker P.L.; Riser K.L.; Vilchis L.I.,"Climate variability, kelp forests, and the Southern California red abalone fishery",2001,Journal of Shellfish Research,20,2,755,763,,"Declines in landings of Southern California abalone fisheries and the eventual collapse of many stocks over the last two decades coincided with a period of greatly increased environmental variability. This included massive storms, an increase in the frequency of warm-water El Niño events after 1976, and an interdecadal-scale increase in sea surface temperatures. Kelp populations may be decimated by severe storms or warm water. Because of the strong inverse relationship between nitrate availability and water temperature, temperature is a good indicator of nitrate availability or stress SINCE kelp growth ceases in warm nutrient-depleted water, tissue decays, and standing stocks may be greatly reduced. Abalones are affected by the availability of the drift kelp on which they feed. Anomalously warm temperatures may affect reproduction, and altered current patterns may affect larval dispersal. Because water temperature varies with location in Southern California and each of the five exploited abalone species has its own thermal preferences, we chose to evaluate the role of environmental variability on populations of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) on three northern Channel Islands spanning a temperature gradient. We compared water temperature regimes and anomalies, monthly aerial surveys of canopies of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), and field evidence of poor abalone growth and reproduction during El Niño events. The severity of El Niño disturbances and long-term changes in kelp standing stocks both correlated with the temperature gradient. Declines of red abalone total landings and area-specific landings on the warmer Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Island began a decade after the large 1957-1959 El Niño. The subsequent collapse of many populations appears related to warm anomalies after the 1976-1977 regime shift, kelp declines, and poor reproduction coupled with fishing-induced declines in adult abalone density. Red abalone populations have persisted on cooler San Miguel Island where thermal anomalies had less effect and kelp canopy biomass has been more stable. Southern California abalones evolved in this disturbance regime, but the combination of extended periods of increased environmental variability with intense fishing pressure may have led to the loss of local populations, especially in warmer areas.",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035717349

Survival and growth rates were evaluated for 28 days. Shells were counted to determine mortality and shell size was determined by digital analysis of video recorded images. The highest survival (89.4% after 28 days) and growth rates (37.1 μm day-1) were found at 6 μE, whereas the lowest survival (3.5%) and growth rates (21.1 μm day-1) occurred at 47 μE.

Pleurotomarioidea achieved greatest numerical and morphological diversity during the Paleozoic, and dominated global shallow water marine gastropod faunas during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic. Only a single family, the Pleurotomariidae, survived the end-Cretaceous Extinction, but was restricted to deep water through most of the Cenozoic. The first living pleurotomariid was discovered during the mid-nineteenth century, along the bathyal zone of the western Atlantic. Subsequently collected specimens of these ""living fossils"" revealed that these animals comprise a mosaic of primitive and highly derived characters that originally inspired a new model of gastropod evolution, but more recently defy the orderly inclusion of this group within a cladistic framework of gastropod phylogeny. Molecular studies have likewise shown that the 18S rDNA gene of pleurotomariids contains novel insertions, and evolves more rapidly than in related taxa. A number of studies confirm that the Pleurotomarioidea may be included in the clade Vetigastropoda together with the Trochoidea, Fissurelloidea, Haliotoidea, and Scissurelloidea. However, neither the position of the super-family within Vetigastropoda, nor the position of Vetigastropoda within Gastropoda is yet robustly resolved. The anatomical and molecular data are reviewed; the latter used to produce a well-resolved phylogeny of the genera within the family, and to justify the naming of the long-used informal grouping ""Perotrochus Group B"" as the genus Bayerotrochus. A review of the geographic and bathymetric distributions of pleurotomariids reveals that the higher taxa segregate bathymetrically, while the species within each genus generally segregate geographically, so that most species exist in allopatry. The diet of pleurotomariids is reviewed, based on direct observations as well as analyses of gut contents, and is shown to consist primarily of sponges, but may include stalked crinoids, octocorals and, under aquarium conditions, fish and clam tissue. Despite their thin and relatively fragile shells, Pleurotomariidae survive an extraordinary number of attacks by predators, primarily crustaceans and fish. Their hypobranchial glands are capable of rapidly secreting a white fluid that probably serves as a chemical defense to repel predators. Circumstantial evidence suggests that this defensive mechanism may have originated during the Paleozoic. Despite the great antiquity of this lineage, pleurotomariids possess a substantial number of morphological, molecular and ecological novelties.",10.1016/s0065-2881(02)42015-9,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036050312

Larvae of the abalone Haliotis discus hannai were offered, in a petri dish, a choice of several food patches, each made of a diatom monoculture layer. The distribution of the larval settlement on the patches of 17 diatom species was determined. Nitzschia laevis induced the most abalone larvae settlement, followed by Navicula cf lenzii and Amphora luciae. The attractiveness of these diatoms for abalone larvae settlement was not directly related to algal biochemical composition or algal color. It is suggested that compounds excreted by algal cells determine their inductive properties for larval settlement. The larval chemosensory response depends on the concentration of these inductive substances. Sonicated diatom cell suspensions strongly induced larvae attachment, whereas dilute suspensions did not. Boiling settlement-inductive sonicated diatom cell suspensions did not affect their induction ability, implying that native proteins are not essential for the response. Aspartic acid was the only free amino acid excreted by two tested diatoms. It was also the only pure amino acid found inductive for larval settlement. It is therefore suggested that aspartic acid is a component of the settlement induction complex.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-4644324795

Three major changes in the feeding of H. discus hannai were identified by reviewing recent studies on the feeding habits of this species. The first change occurred at the time of the metamorphosis, namely a shift from lecithotrophy to particle feeding. In the second change, when the shell length (SL) reached values of about 0.6-0.8 mm, post-larvae were able to digest diatom diets and they grew more rapidly on efficiently digested strains. The final change consisted of a shift from a biofilm-dominated diet to a macroalgal-dominated diet. Post-larval abalone (> 1.8 mm SL) were able to utilize juvenile macroalgae efficiently. These changes in the feeding habits were closely related to ontogenetic changes in the digestive enzyme activities and the development of the radula morphology.",10.6090/jarq.37.89,Review,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141590420

As the rates of climate change and exploitation accelerate, additive and synergistic interactions between them are becoming increasingly important to the dynamics of marine ecosystems and the sustainability of marine fisheries. We examine the impacts of climate change and fishing pressure on the stocks of three commonly exploited intertidal invertebrates on Northeast Pacific rocky shores. California sea mussels (Mytilus californianus) are not likely to experience dramatic population shifts in the face of climate change, and the current low levels of exploitation appear to be sustainable. Owl limpets (Lottia gigantea), which grow more slowly, exhibit higher temperature sensitivity, and are preferred targets of fishers, will likely experience considerable reductions in distribution and abundance if temperatures rise and exploitation continues. Black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii) have already experienced dramatic declines directly attributable to over-exploitation and indirectly to warming trends that have exacerbated the effects of a devastating disease. Two generalities emerge from these comparisons. First, differences in life history characteristics result in a wide range of climatic and anthropogenic effects among species. Second, the effects of fishing pressure may unexpectedly magnify the effects of climate change, and vice versa. Synergistic interactions between environmental change and exploitation on rocky shores and in other marine ecosystems present considerable challenges for fisheries managers. The key to successful management and restoration in marine systems lies in developing a mechanistic understanding of the interactions between climate change and fishing pressure and how they affect population and ecosystem dynamics.",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-27644448781

The combined effect of low frequency climatic variability and anthropogenic perturbations can have dramatic consequences for abalone in southern California. Abalone species are tightly linked to kelp forest ecosystems that, besides furnishing habitat, also provide the main food source for abalone. In southern California, kelp canopies are very sensitive to oceanographic climate because the kelp depend upon high nutrients in the water column. Oceanic warming, in turn, results in decreased nutrients in the surface water, and this is correlated with marked reductions in giant kelp biomass. Here we address the additive effects of ocean warming on two species of California abalone (the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens; and the green abalone, H. fulgens) by subjecting them to varied environmental conditions similar to cool, normal, and warm phases of the California current in the southern California Bight. Our experimental design simultaneously tested the synergistic effects of temperature and food quantity and quality on survivorship, growth, and reproduction. For red abalone, warm temperatures increased the onset of withering syndrome, a fatal abalone disease, and halted growth and reproduction. In contrast, green abalone survivorship, growth, and reproduction were relatively robust irrespective of temperature, while their growth and reproduction were most strongly influenced by food quantity. We found clear evidence suggesting that, combined with overfishing, California abalone populations are adversely affected by ecosystem responses to ocean warming: Coolwater red abalone suffer stronger consequences in warm water than do green abalone. Conservation, restoration, and recovery plans of remnant California abalone populations must consider these relationships when taking any action. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",10.1890/03-5326,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-15944390275

Dissolved signal molecules that cause sperm to orient and accelerate towards an egg could play pivotal roles in fertilization success, but such compounds are largely undescribed. This investigation considered the behavioral responses of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) sperm to soluble factors released into sea water by conspecific eggs. Sperm in proximity to individual live eggs swam significantly faster and oriented towards the egg surface. Bioassay-guided fractionation was employed to isolate the chemoattractant, yielding a single pure, fully active compound after reversed-phase and size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography. Chemical characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated that the free amino acid L-tryptophan was the natural sperm attractant in H. rufescens. Eggs released L-tryptophan at concentrations that triggered both activation and chemotaxis in sperm, exhibiting significant activity at levels as low as 10-8moll-1. The D-isomer of tryptophan was inactive, showing that the sperm response was stereospecific. Serotonin, a potent neuromodulator and tryptophan metabolite, had no effect on sperm swim speeds or on orientation. In experimental treatments involving an elevated, uniform concentration of tryptophan (10-7 moll-1) or the addition of tryptophanase, an enzyme that selectively digests tryptophan, sperm failed to navigate towards live eggs. A natural gradient of L-tryptophan was therefore necessary and sufficient to promote recruitment of sperm to the surface of eggs in red abalone.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036324568

Larvae of H. fulgens utilized triacylglycerol as a primary source of endogenous energy reserves for development (∼50% depletion from egg to metamorphic competence). Amounts of phospholipid remained constant, and protein dropped by about 30%. After embryogenesis, larvae of H. fulgens had oxygen consumption rates of 81.7 ± 5.9 (SE) pmol larva-1 h-1 at 15°C through subsequent development. The loss of biochemical reserves fully met the needs of metabolism, as measured by oxygen consumption. Larvae of H. sorenseni were examined during later larval development and were metabolically and biochemically similar to H. fidgens larvae at a comparable stage. Metabolic rates of both species were very similar to previous data for a congener, H. rufescens, suggesting that larval metabolism and energy utilization may be conserved among closely related species that also share similar developmental morphology and feeding modes.",10.2307/1543598,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038041978

Methods for introducing DIC included additions of NaHCO3, CO2, and variable seawater exchange rates. Specific growth rates (SGRs) of P. mollis were positively correlated with ambient concentrations of DIC and cultures supplied with both CO2 and NaHCO3 resulted in higher growth rates than those supplied with either inorganic carbon sources alone.

Adopting a seawater flushing regime that increased flushing during the light cycle (seawater exchange rate of 7.5 vol day-1) but lowered flushing during the dark cycle (0.65 vol day-1) resulted in growth rates equal to those obtained by maintaining pH at 8.5 by sparging with CO2 at a daily exchange rate of 7.5 vol day-1. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Weight gain (WG), increase in shell length (SL), specific growth rate (SGR), protein efficiency ratio (PER) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were evaluated. Highest weight gain (WG: 454%) was attained with abalone fed diet 2 with protein sources coming from a combination of FM, SM, and DSM. This value was, however, not significantly different (P < 0.05) from those fed diets 4 and 1 (Control diet) with protein sources coming from FM, SM, SP and FM, DSM, SM, respectively.

Based on broken line analyses, the thiamin requirement to satisfy maximum growth was estimated to be 51 mg/kg diet, and the dietary thiamin levels to maximize visceral TPP content and TPP-effect of H. discus hannai were estimated to be 61 and 58 mg/kg diet, respectively. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Friedman C.S.; Trevelyan G.; Robbins T.T.; Mulder E.P.; Fields R.,Development of an oral administration of oxytetracycline to control losses due to withering syndrome in cultured red abalone Haliotis rufescens,2003,Aquaculture,224,1-Apr,1,23,,"Withering syndrome (WS) is a lethal bacterial disease of wild and cultured abalone, Haliotis spp., along the west coast of North America. Therapeutic treatment of WS was assessed using oxytetracycline (OTC) by injection and oral administration. Survival of OTC-injected red and black abalone was significantly higher than that of sham-treated animals (p < 0.001 and p = 0.036, respectively). Microscopic examination revealed that these animals died from WS and that tissue damage was beyond the ability of the animals to repair. Feeding rates of treated abalone were also significantly higher than for sham-treated control animals (p < 0.001 for black abalone and p < 0.0001 for red abalone). Oral administration (oxytetracycline medicated feed for 14 consecutive days) also effectively controlled WS in both pilot and production scale applications. The treatment caused significant and persistent long-term reductions in the intensity of bacterial infection as well as in the degree of morphological changes in the digestive gland (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). On a pilot scale, using a 14-day treatment with a 4.2% OTC wet feed, mortality dropped from 36% in the controls to 5% in the treated populations (p < 0.001). On a commercial scale, a dry floating feed containing 2.6% OTC was found to be just as effective. Withering syndrome caused heavy (41%) mortality in control production tanks, but treated tanks experienced only 9% mortality (p < 0.001). Treated tanks produced 56% more market sized abalone than control tanks (p < 0.001), and larger abalones were harvested from treated than control tanks. This resulted in 70% more biomass of market abalone in treated tanks relative to control tanks (p < 0.01). Concentrations of oxytetracycline in individual abalone foot muscle were variable and peaked at over 40 ppm. Residues declined to <2 ppm, the federal tolerance level, between 15 and 22 days post-treatment. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Bower S.M.,Update on emerging abalone diseases and techniques for health assessment,2003,Journal of Shellfish Research,22,3,805,810,,"This article presents a review of new diseases and additional information on known pathogens of abalone that were encountered in the last few years as a result of increasing efforts towards the culture of abalone around the world and concurrent investigations into abalone health. A novel haplosporidian was associated with high mortalities (82.5-90%) of cultured juvenile paua (Haliotis iris) in New Zealand. Disease outbreaks among cultured abalone in Tasmania, Australia were associated with two species of Vibrio (V. harveyi and V. splendidus I) and a Flavobacterium-like bacterium with stress factors precipitating the diseases in most cases. The agent of withering syndrome responsible for mass mortalities of black abalone (H. cracherodii) in southern California was identified as the Rickettsiales-like prokaryote ""Candidates Xenohaliotis californiensis"". The exotic sabellid polychaete that seriously impacted abalone culture in California was named Terebrasabella heterouncinata and experimentally found to reproduce at low temperatures but with a significantly temperature-dependant generation time (a developmental cycle of 298 days at 11.2°C in comparison to 165 days at 15.6°C). To assess the health of cultured abalone, histologic examinations are essential. For histology, tissue samples (less than 1 cm thick) should be fixed in Davidson's solution or 10% formalin in seawater such that there is at least 10 parts fixative to 1 part tissue. Histopathology will not only indicate the presence of infectious agents but can be useful for monitoring the suitability of the diet and aquaculture environment. These assessments will benefit abalone aquaculture and provide assurance that only healthy animals are used in stock rehabilitation programs.",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3843135087

The alga in the low nitrogen medium contained 37% less total amino acid than that in the high and standard nitrogen media. There was a slightly greater reduction in essential amino acids (40%) compared to non-essential amino acids (35%). Juvenile abalone feeding on Navicula grown in medium with low nitrate and lower total amino acid content grew more slowly than when fed on the same species grown in standard or higher nitrogen medium with a higher amino acid content. The growth rate of juveniles was highest (43 μm d-1) in the high nitrate treatment followed (40 μm d-1) by the standard nitrate treatment and lowest (31 μm d-1) in the low nitrate treatment. The survival of the juveniles was also effected by the diet. Survival was better in the high and standard nitrogen media (88%) than the low nitrogen medium (75%). The results suggest that in order to achieve uniformity in nutritional quality of diatoms and good growth of abalone juveniles in commercial abalone nurseries, the nitrogen concentration in tanks should be monitored and additional nitrate added to provide an optimum concentration of between 2 and 12 mg NO3-N L-1.",10.1023/A:1023853628544,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038042019

All S. uberis strains produced the enzyme beta-D-glucuronidase, while the S. parauberis strains were negative. The S. uberis and S. parauberis 16S rRNA genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subsequently digested with the restriction enzymes RsaI and AvaII yielding species-specific restriction patterns. Both species were additionally identified by amplifying species-specific parts of the genes encoding the 16S rRNA, the 23S rRNA and the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region, respectively. The CAMP factor gene cfu, a potential virulence factor of S. uberis, was amplified, corresponding to a phenotypically positive CAMP-reaction, using cfu-specific oligonucleotide primers. In addition the streptokinase/plasminogen activator encoding genes skc/pauA, a second potential virulence factor, could be amplified for 126 of the 130 S. uberis but not for S. parauberis. A DNA fingerprinting of S. uberis strains, performed by macrorestriction analysis of their chromosomal DNA by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, revealed that most of the isolates were not related to each other. However, identical DNA patterns were noted for some of the isolates within different quarters of an individual cow and also for different cows within the same farm. The generally unrelated DNA patterns indicated that S. uberis is a pathogen with multiple environmental habitats and that infections are caused by a great variety of strains.",10.4142/jvs.2003.4.3.213,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-1542392626
Wu G.; Mai K.; Tan B.; Zhu W.,"Dietary biotin requirement of juvenile abalone, Haliotis discus hannai Ino",2002,Journal of Shellfish Research,21,1,211,217,,"The experiment was conducted to quantify the biotin requirement of juvenile abalone, Haliotis discus hannai Ino. The possible biotin-synthesizing capacity of intestinal microflora was also examined. Seven purified diets were formulated to provide a series of biotin (0, 0.5, 1.0. 3.0, 6.0, 12.0, 20.0 mg/kg diet). An antibiotic diet was supplemented with tretracycline hydrochloride (4-g/kg diet) in basal diet to suppress possible intestinal bacteria synthesis. To reduce leaching, dietary biotin and other water-soluble vitamins were encapsulated by calcium alginate. Abalone juveniles of similar size (initial mean weight 175.1 ± 3.6 mg; mean shell length 11.66 ± 0.14 mm) were distributed in a flowing-through system using a completely randomized design with eight treatments and three replicates per treatment. They were fed the appropriate diet once every day for a 110-day period. Results of this study clearly showed the necessity of dietary biotin for juvenile abalone as the daily increment in shell length (DISL), visceral pyruvate carboxylase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase activities were significantly influenced by the dietary biotin levels (ANOVA, P < 0.05). However, the survival, specific growth rate (SGR) and carcass proximate compositions were not significantly influenced by dietary biotin at the end of the experimental period. The viscera biotin concentration (VBC) of abalone increased as the biotin supplementation level increased (r = 0.91). Compared to those of other groups, SGR, DISL, VBC and two carboxylase activities of antibiotic group were obviously depressed. It indicated that the intestinal microflora probably contribute to biotin nutrition for juvenile abalone. Based on measurements of DISL and two carboxylase activities, the optimum biotin requirement was estimated to be 0.42 mg/kg and 0.67-0.70 mg/kg for maximum growth and carboxylase activities, respectively.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036074599

Sales J.; Britz P.J.,Evaluation of different markers to determine apparent nutrient digestibility coefficients of feed ingredients for South African abalone (Haliotis midae L.),2001,Aquaculture,202,1-Feb,113,129,,"Chromic oxide (Cr2O3), acid-insoluble ash (AIA) and crude fibre were evaluated as inert markers in digestibility studies with Haliotis midae by calculating apparent dry matter, organic matter, energy, protein and amino acid availability for fish meal, soybean meal and cottonseed meal included at 30% into a reference diet. AIA was the only marker that yielded consistent realistic apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs), which were comparable (P > 0.05) to values derived through total collection. Both Cr2O3 and crude fibre in faeces were either lower or similar to their respective levels in feed, resulting in negative ADCs. Leaching of markers from the diets did not have an effect (P > 0.05) on digestibility coefficients. No difference (P > 0.05) was found in apparent dry matter digestibility between faeces voided either during the night or daytime. Washing of faeces with distilled water after collection had no influence (P > 0.05) on AIA content. In all test ingredients, mean apparent amino acid availability reflected apparent protein digestibility. Apparent digestibility of protein in fish meal (76%) by H. midae was within the range of values reported for fish species (62-91%). Soybean meal is a promising feed ingredient in abalone feeds due to the high apparent digestibility of its organic matter (79%), energy (83%), protein (85%) and both essential and non-essential amino acids (mean of 86%). © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Juvenile H. laevigata growth rates were strongly correlated to the density of N. jeffreyi but not to the density of Cocconeis sp. Juvenile growth rates did not differ between diatom species or shading condition. A reduction in the photophobic behaviour of juvenile H. laevigata was observed in shaded aquaria, suggesting that abalone are not strictly nocturnal feeders. Results demonstrate the importance and effect of light intensity on the growth of diatom species and the growth, survival and behaviour of juvenile H. laevigata.

However, in a commercial situation, adult abalone (Haliotis iris) caught for broodstock or pearling, show reluctance to start feeding on stationary artificial food. If they cannot be induced to feed, they may lapse into a starvation phase that can last several weeks. Subtidal adult H. iris (125 mm shell length) were collected during autumn, winter, spring, and summer from Banks Peninsula, Canterbury and held at Pendarves Abalone Farm Ltd. (South Island, New Zealand). Abalone were divided randomly into two groups. One group was offered a commercial pellet diet together with small quantities (0.03-0.05g dry weight L-1) of suspended seaweed particles (Gracilaria spp.) to test its potential as a tactile phagostimulant. The other group (nonstimulant control) were supplied with the same commercial diet without the algal stimulant Each group consisted of three replicate vessels containing three individuals. Abalone behavioral responses and ingestion rates were monitored in both groups over a 3-wk period. Abalone in the stimulant experiment exhibited a typical feeding posture almost immediately, were more alert, and engaged in a greater range of feeding activities than the abalone that had been supplied with commercial food only. Those abalone without access to the algal stimulant remained either quiescent or alert in most seasons. Feeding activity of abalone in the stimulant treatment was significantly higher (P < 0.05) as compared with abalone from the nonstimulant control for all seasons except winter. Also, abalone consumed significantly more artificial food when tactile stimulants were present during autumn and winter. However, ingestion rates seemed highly sensitive to both season and acclimation time. Within each season, there was a consistent trend of increasing ingestion rate during the third week of the experiment, and this was most discernible in the stimulant treatment.",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035715502

In a second experiment, the influence of inclusion level of a feed ingredient (soybean meal) on apparent dry matter, organic matter, energy and protein digestibility was evaluated. Apparent protein digestibility coefficients exceeding 100% were found for sunflower meal and canola meal included into a reference diet. This also occurred when evaluating different inclusion levels of soybean meal into a fish meal reference diet, eliminating the opportunity to test the influence of inclusion level of soybean meal on apparent nutrient digestibility. Associative effects between different feed ingredients, diet and faecal nutrient leaching and mathematical artifacts in calculations when using substitution vs. single protein diets might have an influence on final apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) of highly digestible feed ingredients. It was found that apparent protein digestibility coefficients determined with single protein diets predicted determined digestibility in compound diets with an error of less than 3.3% compared to a deviation of 13% to 16% when using coefficients determined with substitution trials. The conclusion from this study is that single protein diets should be used for determining apparent protein digestibility coefficients of feed ingredients for H. midae when evaluating feed ingredients for feed composition tables. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

One of the obstacles to this harmonization is the negative economic relationship between developments and conservation. In order to sustain a systematic aquaculture, we need to establish benefits for both the human economy and the biological economy. The polyculture of Ulva and fish has been conducted by our group since 1964, with differing intents. Sakai was able to develop an abalone culture that fed on the Ulva cultured in the fish farm, and these mollusks produced green pearls as a byproduct of this fish culture. In that way, human profit was harmonized with the biological economy. The whole aqua-crop ensilage (WACE) system has been lectured by Hirata since 1999. The fish culture introduces nutrients into the sea. The nutrients contribute to the growth of sessile organisms. Whole organisms are harvested and ensilaged to produce the probiotic feed. This feed is mixed with routine fish feed. Ruminated culture will also be applied for byproducing the rotifer in culture of fish.

The results of these measurements indicated that two of the formulated diets could be used for commercial culture of H. asinina. Nutritional and physical parameters of these diets were used in a multivariate regression analysis to identify variables that explained the most variation in growth between diets. Parameters that were selected by this analysis were the ratio of crude protein (CP) to gross energy (GE) and the rate that protein leached from the formulated diets. The resulting regression equation was highly significant in its explanation of the variation in growth (P = 2.2 × 10-6).

All animals were then killed and samples of foot, digestive gland (DG) and gonad analyzed for lipid and fatty acid (FA) composition, as was the feed. The feed contained 5% lipid, of which the major FA were 18:2n-6 (27%), 18:1n-9 (20%) and 16:0 (16%). The lipid content of each tissue was similar for both species, ranging from 4-6%, 8-9%, 14-15%, and 30-32% in the foot, testis, DG and ovary, respectively.

The proportions of LA and EPA in the DG were intermediate between those of the testis and ovary. There was no change in the lipid or fatty acid composition of blacklip or greenlip tissues in response to the two culture temperatures. Likewise, these compositions did not appear to differ between tissues from spent and gravid individuals.

Abalone were initially fed a nutritionally balanced formulated diet. Both PUFA and HUFA were low in the experimental formulated diets. After 60 days, growth rates of abalone fed the formulated diets were low and probably reflective of a lack of sufficient essential fatty acids. However, the total lipid content of the muscle tissue of abalone fed diets LL and HL remained unchanged from that of the start of the experiment. However, the level in the starved abalone was significantly higher (21.5%) than that of abalone at the start of the experiment. The percentage of polar lipid and neutral lipid in the abalone muscle tissue ranged from 70.8% to 76.1% and 23.9% to 29.2%, respectively. Levels of 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3 and 22:5n-3 in the polar lipid of the muscle of the starved abalone significantly increased while levels of 20:4n-6 and 20:5n-3 in the neutral lipid for abalone in all treatments decreased, suggesting the essentiality of these HUFA. Levels of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 in the polar lipid of the tissue of the starved abalone were significantly higher than the levels of these respective fatty acids in the abalone fed diets HL and LL. These higher levels probably reflect the weight loss associated with starvation combined with lipid not being used as an energy source. More research directed toward the determination of the fatty acid requirements of postlarvae and for successful maturation and a spawning of abalone needs to be conducted. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, a second S. uberis plasminogen activator (PauB) was identified from a Danish mastitis isolate. Interestingly, the pauB open reading frame occupied the locus normally filled by pauA. In the present study a genetic screen of streptococcal and field isolates frequently associated with mastitis was undertaken to assess the distribution, chromosomal location and sequence variation of these putative virulence factors. Methods: Southern analysis of a diverse panel of streptococci and additional bacterial isolates frequently associated with bovine mastitis was performed using pauA and pauB probes. Sequence variation of PauA was assessed at the protein level following nucleotide sequence analysis of pauA alleles amplified from isolates picked from different geographical locations. Results: We observed plasminogen activators to be universally distributed amongst S. uberis. A pauA allele was identified in all but one strain of S. uberis. This strain had a pauB allele substituted for pauA at the same locus. The remarkably low level of sequence variation demonstrated by PauA was further restricted to a limited number of residues within the molecule. Interpretation & conclusion: The high prevalence of PauA alleles in field isolates of S.uberis supported the observation that plasminogen activators are likely to confer an advantage with respect to colonization and growth. The findings of the present study support the theory that PauA plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of S. uberis.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3442883378

A feeding trial was designed to cover a full reproductive cycle in young adult green abalone, Haliotis fulgens, consisting of five diet treatments: the macrophytic algal phaeophyte Egregia menziesii, rhodophyte Chondracanthus canaliculatus, chlorophyte Ulva lobata, a composite of the three algae and a starvation control. The lipid class, fatty acid, sterol and 1-O-alkyl glyceryl ether profiles were determined for foot, hepatopancreas/gonad tissues and larvae. The major fatty acids were 16:0, 18:0, 18:1(n-7)c, 18:1(n-9)c, 20:4(n-6), 20:5(n-3) and 22:5(n-3), as well as 14:0 for abalone fed brown and red algae. 4,8,12-Trimethyltridecanoic acid, derived from algae, was detected for the first time in H. fulgens (hepatopancreas complex, 1.2-13.9%; larvae, 0.5% of total fatty acids). Diacylglyceryl ethers were present in larvae (0.6% of total lipid). The major 1-O-alkyl glycerols were 16:0, 16:1 and 18:0. Additionally, 18:1(n-9) was a major component in hepatopancreas/gonad and larvae. The major sterol was cholesterol (96-100% of total sterols). Highest growth rates were linked to temperature and occurred in abalone fed the phaeophyte E. menziesii (43 μm·day-1, 56 mg·day-1 yearly mean), an alga containing the highest levels of C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids and the highest ratio of 20:4(n-6) to 20:5(n-3). This study provides evidence of the influence of diet and temperature on seasonal changes in abalone lipid profiles, where diet is most strongly related to body mass and temperature to shell length. The allocation of lipids to specific tissues in green abalone clarifies their lipid metabolism. These results provide a basis for improving nutrition of abalone in mariculture through formulation of artificial feeds. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Clarke S.,Understanding pressures on fishery resources through trade statistics: A pilot study of four products in the Chinese dried seafood market,2004,Fish and Fisheries,5,1,53,74,,"This study investigates the dried seafood trade, centred in Chinese markets, in order to better understand the pressures its demand exerts on global marine resource stocks. Using Hong Kong, the region's largest entrepôt, as a focal point, the trade in shark fins, abalone, bêche-de-mer and dried fish is characterized in terms of product history, volume, source fisheries and species composition. Trends identified in the Hong Kong market are interpreted in the context of the larger Chinese market. Shark fin imports grew 6% per year between 1991 and 2000, most likely because of market expansion in Mainland China, posing increasingly greater pressures on global shark resources. In contrast, the quantities of dried abalone traded through Hong Kong remained steady, but inferences based on this trend are discouraged by suggestions of increasing preferences for fresh product forms and growing domestic production in Mainland China. Hong Kong's imports of dried bêche-de-mer (sea cucumber) have decreased, while the percentage of imports re-exported has remained steady, suggesting that Hong Kong continues as an entrepôt for Mainland China despite declining domestic consumption. Few conclusions can be drawn regarding dried fish products, including whole fish and fish maws, because of a lackof product differentiation in customs data, but a market survey was conducted to provide information on species composition. Comparison of Hong Kong dried seafood trade statistics to those of other key trading partners indicates that, in general. Hong Kong's duty-free status appears to encourage more accurate reporting of traded quantities. Under-reporting biases ranged from 24 to 49% for shark fin and bêche-de-mer, respectively. Comparison to United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) databases indicates additional under-reporting for shark fin such that an alternative minimum estimate of world trade is at least twice the FAO estimates in 1998-2000. The results of a survey of Hong Kong traders provide insight into their attitudes toward harvest, economic and regulatory factors, and suggest that conservation efforts are unlikely to emerge from, or be actively supported by, dried seafood trade organizations. The market's apparent sensitivity to economic sentiment, however, reveals an opportunity for consumer education to play a role in shaping future market growth and resource conservation. Recommendations are provided for improving trade statistics and for developing better analytical techniques to complement traditional methods for monitoring the exploitation and management of fisheries resources.",10.1111/j.1467-2960.2004.00137.x,Review,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-1842866299

An intensive, biofiltered recirculating integrated system producing fish and seaweed on a semi-commercial scale was evaluated with respect to production and to nutrient and heat budgets. The system consisted of abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) and sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) tanks, an intensive fishpond (Sparus aurata), and a three-stage Ulva lactuca biofilter, which cleaned and recirculated 50% of the effluent back to the fishpond. To preserve water heat, the shellfish and fishpond units were both covered with greenhouses; the biofilter unit was covered with a greenhouse only during winter. Seaweed yield was variable and averaged 94 and 117 g m-2 day-1 (fresh weight) in periods with and without greenhouse cover, respectively. Protein content of U. lactuca averaged above 34% of dry weight. The biofiltration of only 50% of the water through the seaweed biofilter reduced the export of dissolved nutrients to the environment by nearly 30%. Peak ammonia excretion by the morning-fed fish coincided with maximum seaweed light-dependent ammonia uptake and concentrations of ammonia in the fishpond remained within nontoxic limits. Also, daytime photosynthesis of U. lactuca (uptake of CO2) met fish respiration (production of CO2), thus balancing fishpond pH levels within safe limits regarding ammonia toxicity. Daytime oxygen demand by the fish was partially met by the photosynthetically generated oxygen. Before covering the biofilter with a greenhouse, it lost much heat, reducing the temperature in the fishpond. Following the greenhouse covering of the biofilter, heat loss ceased and consequently the fishpond temperature was raised. Recirculation through the biofilter improved system sustainability; it reduced water use, lowered negative environmental impact, and maintained stable and safe water quality conditions in the fishpond. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Based on a 2 x 2 factorial design, four casein-gelatin-based diets were formulated. The basal diet was supplemented with either 0 or 2000 IU VD3/kg diet and 0 or 10 g P/kg diet. The abalone was reared in P-free artificial seawater for 55 days. Results showed that dietary VD3 was hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1α,25(OH)2D3] in abalone, and subsequently raised the serum levels of these two VD3 metabolites. Dietary P deficiency elevated serum 1α,25(OH)2D3 level only when the dietary VD3 supplementation was sufficient. The supplementations of either dietary VD3 or P significantly increased the levels of P in serum, mantle and hepatopancreas, and only the addition of VD3 significantly raised the concentrations of Ca in serum and mantle (P<0.05). Interaction between dietary VD3 and P was only found significant on the concentrations of P and Mg in mantle (P<0.05). The concentrations of Ca, P and Mg in muscle were not significantly influenced by these dietary treatments. Hence, the metabolic responses in serum, muscle, mantle and hepatopancreas of abalone to dietary VD3 and P were in different manners. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",10.1002/jez.a.10295,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0348155675

We also investigated the effects of these diets on serum lipid levels. Male rats were fed these diets for 23 days. Protein quality indicators (true digestibility, net protein utilization, biological value) were similar to those obtained for casein-based feeds except for lower true digestibility and net protein utilization values for the Anemonia viridis feed. HDL-cholesterol level was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the groups fed marine species or casein supplemented with olive oil than in the casein group. Total-cholesterol level was higher in the group fed Haliotis tuberculata fed than in the other groups. These results suggest that these marine species are a good protein source, and that they may have positive effects on serum cholesterol level.

It was established that at a dietary inclusion rate of 0.5%, the chromic oxide was inert, was not absorbed by the animal, did not interfere with the digestive process, and moved through the intestine at the similar rate to the protein.

Concurrent ecological surveys have demonstrated the dependence of juvenile abalone on urchins for their survival, and a radical increase in the abundance of lobsters in the area that is the main abalone fishing ground. This paper describes laboratory experiments on the consumption of urchins by lobsters, and the preferences for different prey species. Small lobsters (<68 mm carapace length) ate no urchins. Larger lobsters ate urchins of all sizes, although small urchins were preferred. The consumption rate was easily sufficient for the lobsters to have caused the documented disappearance of urchins (and juvenile abalone) in the main abalone fishing area. Lobsters showed a strong preference for mussels over all other prey offered, and for juvenile abalone over urchins, although previous field observations and laboratory experiments have shown that urchins provide shelter for juvenile abalone. However, if black mussels were available in addition to sea urchins and juvenile abalone, consumption of sea urchins and juvenile abalone declined.",10.1071/MF00067,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034786909

Thus, the aim of the present work was to evaluate the physiological responses from juvenile green abalone (Haliotis fulgens), grouped according to size, in a standard controlled culture condition within their optimal range to create the balanced growth equation within an allometric relation, providing a basic framework for physiological research into H. fulgens. Feed intake, absorption efficiency, respiration and excretion were measured as functions of dry tissue weight (DTW) in juvenile abalone acclimated on a balanced diet. The daily feed intake (I) was related to body mass by the relationship I (mg day-1)=24.25W0.59. Absorption efficiency averaged 87% and was independent of body size. The equation relating daily respiration rate (R) to body mass was R (ml O2 day-1)=12.013W0.704, including night correction. The rate of ammonia excretion (U) was related to dry tissue weight by the equation U (μmol N-NH4 day-1)=43.57W0.85. The energetic value of food was 18.8 J mg-1. The low feeding activity (<1% of abalone live weight per day) was compensated for by a relatively high absorption efficiency and a depression of 23% in the metabolic rate during diurnal activity. Gross and net growth efficiencies were constant throughout the size range, with average values of 36.4% and 41.5%, respectively. Values of the O/N ratio, with an average of 31.5, showed a higher use of proteins from the diet as an energy source for the size range studied. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Three qualitative conceptual models were developed and compared; the first and second ones assuming homogeneous and heterogeneous environmental conditions, respectively, and the third expanded one considering eco-social components under the assumption of environmental heterogeneity. For all these models, the factors described by Vásquez [Bot. Mar. 38 (1995) 251] were included in the management plan for the harvesting of brown macroalgae. Based on Levins's Loop Analysis, the system will have a just weakly unstable moving equilibrium if the harvesting activities do not negatively affect the macrophyta's reproduction and recruitment processes. Therefore, coincidence of reproduction and/or recruitment with harvesting must be avoided in a putative management plan. Regarding the qualitative predictions of the system's behaviour after negatively affecting reproduction and recruitment, only an ecological model assuming a heterogeneous environment shows realistic responses in comparison to experimental studies on the same species. This contribution is the first approach considering the dynamical behaviour of L. nigrescens and its surroundings. Nevertheless, further models, based on the same modelling theory, may integrate more variables from social and economical fields in order to improve the scope of this complex system. Further comparative studies should focus on the assessment of the significance of the structural functions of L. nigrescens and other macroalgae for the conservation of this benthic system. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the present study, red abalone, Haliotis rufescens Swainson 1822, with single sabellid infestations were isolated in containers at 18°C (single host and sabellid per container). This first, parental generation (P), was held in isolation until individuals produced F1 larvae. The F1 larvae were subsequently isolated until individuals produced a second, F2, generation. In a separate study, uninfested red abalone were exposed to sabellid infested abalone at 11.2°C, 15.6°C, and 20.9°C, temperatures typically encountered in California. The larvae were subsequently observed as they developed to specific life stages: the initiation of feeding, the development of all 11 setigers (which closely relates to sexual maturation) and the completion of their life cycle as recognized by the production of motile, infesting, larvae. Approximately 50% of the sabellids examined at 11.2°C, 15.6°C, and 20.9°C had developed the ability to feed by day 6, 5 and 4 (P ≤ 0.001), had developed all 11 setigers by day 83, 68 and 48 (P ≤ 0.001) and had produced larvae by day 298, 165 and 111 (P ≤ 0.001), respectively.

Previously, atomic force microscopy demonstrated that abalone nacre proteins bind to growing step edges and to specific crystallographic faces of calcite, suggesting that inhibition of calcite growth may be one of the molecular processes required for growth of the less thermodynamically stable aragonite phase. Previous experiments were done with protein mixtures. To elucidate the role of single proteins, we have characterized two proteins isolated from the aragonitic component of nacre of the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens. These proteins, purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, are designated AP7 and AP24 (aragonitic protein of molecular weight 7 kDa and 24 kDa, respectively), Degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to N-terminal and internal peptide sequences were used to amplify cDNA clones by a polymerase chain reaction from a mantle cDNA library; the deduced primary amino acid sequences are presented. Preliminary crystal growth experiments demonstrate that protein fractions enriched in AP7 and AP24 produced CaCO3 crystals with morphology distinct from crystals grown in the presence of the total mixture of soluble aragonite-specific proteins, Peptides corresponding to the first 30 residues of the N-terminal sequences of both AP7 and AP24 were generated. The synthetic peptides frustrate the progression of step edges of a growing calcite surface, indicating that sequence features within the N-termini of AP7 and AP24 include domains that interact with CaCO3. CD analyses demonstrate that the N-terminal peptide sequences do not possess significant percentages of α-helix or β-strand secondary structure in solution. Instead, in both the presence and absence of Ca(II), the peptides retain unfolded conformations that may facilitate protein-mineral interaction. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/bip.10536,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038155558
Day E.; Branch G.M.,Effects of sea urchins (Parechinus angulosus) on recruits and juveniles of abalone (Haliotis midae),2002,Ecological Monographs,72,1,133,149,,"Much current research on community ecology concerns indirect effects, cascading trophic interactions, and the role of top-down vs. bottom-up processes, as well as subsidization of matter and energy between different systems. We addressed all these topics by exploring interactions between the urchin Parechinus angulosus and both recruits and juveniles of the abalone Haliotis midae, in the light of the fact that juvenile abalone shelter beneath the urchins. In field experiments at six sites, urchins were eliminated from removal plots to determine the degree to which juvenile abalone (individuals 3-35 mm in length) depend upon urchins. Comparisons were made with undisturbed and disturbance-control plots. We hypothesized that after removal of urchins: (1) there would be an immediate decline of juvenile abalone, since they are intimately associated with the urchins; (2) abalone recruits (recent settlers < 3 mm in length) would be unlikely to suffer immediately or directly because, unlike juveniles, they are only weakly associated with the urchins; (3) foliar algae would proliferate due to decreased grazing by urchins; (4) there would be a consequent reduction in crustose coralline algae due to overgrowth by foliar algae; and (5) the decline of crustose corallines would reduce recruitment of abalone due to a loss of settlement and nursery habitat. In urchin-removal plots, juvenile abalone declined dramatically, becoming virtually extinct locally. Their disappearance was slowest in crevices compared with exposed habitats, but even there they failed to survive longer than five months. Contrary to expectations, abalone recruits also disappeared from urchin-removal plots, possibly because the cover of sediment almost doubled there. Also contrary to our hypotheses, neither foliar macroalgae nor encrusting corallines responded to urchin removal. The explanation of these results is that P. angulosus was able to gather drift kelp when this food source was available, rather than acting as an active grazer. This feeding pattern has profound consequences and explains why urchins failed to influence algal community composition. By sheltering beneath urchins, juvenile abalone gain protection from predators and may also benefit from an enhanced food supply. Bottom-up subsidization of urchins by drift kelp is thus responsible for the feeding behavior of the urchins, and indirectly facilitates their role in harboring juvenile abalone. This role is of immense importance for the lucrative abalone fishery, and depletion of urchins could lead to a collapse of abalone populations. Human exploitation of top predators that consume urchins, such as rock lobsters and some fishes, has conceivably exaggerated the role of urchins in sustaining juvenile abalone.",10.1890/0012-9615(2002)072[0133:eosupa]2.0.co;2,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036165218
Gorfine H.K.,Post-harvest weight loss has important implications for abalone quota management,2001,Journal of Shellfish Research,20,2,795,802,,"Regulations forming part of the abalone quota management system in Victoria, Australia require that abalone processors notify fisheries authorities of quantities of abalone consigned from commercial divers within 25 h of landing. The regulations also require that the abalone are to be landed whole in the shell, and transported and stored in sealed bins until confirmation of official notification. Although the bins cannot be opened before notification, the 25-h limit for notification provides a window of opportunity to make potential gains through weight loss in those abalone destined for canning. This arises because notified weights, rather than weights estimated upon landing, are used to decrement the quota allocations of individual divers. I investigated the potential for post-harvest weight loss by subjecting abalone to three experimental treatments selected to simulate a range of possible transport and storage regimes. My results demonstrate that substantial weight loss can occur in whole abalone during both ambient and refrigerated storage. Loss of weight in abalone during storage results from the release of water and body fluid associated with physiological responses to hypoxic stress caused by exposure to air. In Victoria, about 60% of the landed catch is used to produce canned product. Because of the observed weight losses during storage, divers supplying abalone for canning have to harvest more abalone to achieve their quotas than those supplying abalone for live export. Losses in weight of 10-20% observed during this study equate to a harvest of 6-12% (350,000-700,000 abalone) more than the total allowable catches. Harvesting these additional quantities of abalone may exceed desired fishing mortalities for long-term population sustainability. If beach weights were deducted from quotas, then this problem could be resolved.",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035717264

This study was undertaken to improve our understanding of nutrient requirements and management strategies for P. mollis production in intensive, land-based systems. All experiments were conducted under moderate to high artificial light of 24-52 mol photons m-2 day-1 and low seawater exchange (1 vol day-1), in order to minimize seawater pumping costs. Application of nutrients every 5-7 days resulted in no significant difference in P. mollis growth compared with daily applications. Nutrient additions during the dark cycle compared with the light cycle were found to be effective in controlling epiphytes. The addition of f medium trace metals (Gran. Can. J. Microbiol. 8 (1962) 229) significantly increased growth rates compared with those of cultures supplied with just nitrate and phosphate alone. The concentration of Zn was increased to equal that of Mn (1.37 μM day-1), with resulting improvement in yields. NaNO3 as a source of nitrogen was found to be superior for long-term growth (9 weeks) compared with NH4NO3, although NH 4NO3 was superior on a short-term basis (first 2-5 weeks). This was likely due to NH4+-N toxicity resulting from the experimental design. While P. mollis growth was not significantly different between additions of 1176-2942 μM day-1 NO3 --N (average daily N load), an increasing trend in growth was observed with increasing N loads up to 2942 μM day-1 NO 3--N. P. mollis showed a sharp decline in growth with P additions above 83.3 μM day-1 (average daily P load). Tissue nutrient concentrations and molar ratios (N, P, trace metals, N/P and C/N) can be used in the development of optimal nutrient management strategies to ensure maximum dulse growth rates. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Pleurotomarioidea achieved greatest numerical and morphological diversity during the Paleozoic, and dominated global shallow water marine gastropod faunas during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic. Only a single family, the Pleurotomariidae, survived the end-Cretaceous Extinction, but was restricted to deep water through most of the Cenozoic. The first living pleurotomariid was discovered during the mid-nineteenth century, along the bathyal zone of the western Atlantic. Subsequently collected specimens of these ""living fossils"" revealed that these animals comprise a mosaic of primitive and highly derived characters that originally inspired a new model of gastropod evolution, but more recently defy the orderly inclusion of this group within a cladistic framework of gastropod phylogeny. Molecular studies have likewise shown that the 18S rDNA gene of pleurotomariids contains novel insertions, and evolves more rapidly than in related taxa. A number of studies confirm that the Pleurotomarioidea may be included in the clade Vetigastropoda together with the Trochoidea, Fissurelloidea, Haliotoidea, and Scissurelloidea. However, neither the position of the super-family within Vetigastropoda, nor the position of Vetigastropoda within Gastropoda is yet robustly resolved. The anatomical and molecular data are reviewed; the latter used to produce a well-resolved phylogeny of the genera within the family, and to justify the naming of the long-used informal grouping ""Perotrochus Group B"" as the genus Bayerotrochus. A review of the geographic and bathymetric distributions of pleurotomariids reveals that the higher taxa segregate bathymetrically, while the species within each genus generally segregate geographically, so that most species exist in allopatry. The diet of pleurotomariids is reviewed, based on direct observations as well as analyses of gut contents, and is shown to consist primarily of sponges, but may include stalked crinoids, octocorals and, under aquarium conditions, fish and clam tissue. Despite their thin and relatively fragile shells, Pleurotomariidae survive an extraordinary number of attacks by predators, primarily crustaceans and fish. Their hypobranchial glands are capable of rapidly secreting a white fluid that probably serves as a chemical defense to repel predators. Circumstantial evidence suggests that this defensive mechanism may have originated during the Paleozoic. Despite the great antiquity of this lineage, pleurotomariids possess a substantial number of morphological, molecular and ecological novelties.",10.1016/s0065-2881(02)42015-9,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036262356

This is the first report of cultivation of P. palmata in land-based tanks using isolated spores as seedstocks. Spores were released from field-collected tetrasporphytic fronds. A phenological study determined that tetrasporophytic fronds were fertile during the winter along the coast of northern France. This paper describes techniques for the induction of sporulation, for spore settlement and for incubation of germlings in 1.5-m-diameter tanks in semi-controlled conditions. The yield of released spores was in the range of 5000 to 25,000 g-1 of fertile sections. Mean spore density on substrate placed in hatching tanks was 500 spores cm -2. Spore germination occurred 3 days after inoculation and at this stage survival rate was high (80%). A few days after spore inoculation, both male and female gametophytes had germinated and a male to female ratio of approximately 1:1 was observed. Female gametophytic discs remained microscopic whereas males developed gametophytic fronds. Growth of plantlets was well correlated with the concentration of medium supplements. After 3 months of cultivation in tanks, survival rate was 35% and some plantlets measured more than 2 cm. At this stage, substrates covered with soft young fronds were transferred to an abalone hatchery to feed abalone juveniles. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V.

The growth and survival of juveniles fed artificial diets did not differ from that of juveniles fed the seaweed Gracilariopsis bailinae (control). Feeding the diet-fed juveniles with the seaweed thereafter produced the natural brownish shell, thus forming a sandwiched bluish-green band.

All diets were formulated to contain 27% crude protein, 13% of which was contributed by the various leaf meals. Fresh seaweed Gracilariopsis bailinae served as the control feed. Juvenile Haliotis asinina (mean body weight = 13.4±1.6 g, mean shell length = 38.8±1.4 mm) were fed the diets at 2-3% of the body weight day-1. Seaweed was given at 30% of body weight day-1.

Abalone fed the M. oliefera-based diet had a better growth rate in terms of shell length (P < 0.05) compared with those fed the L. leucocephala-based diet but not with those in other treatments. Furthermore, protein productive value (PPV) of H. asinina was significantly higher when fed the M. oliefera-based diet compared with all other treatments (P < 0.002). Survival was generally high (80-100%) with no significant differences among treatments. Abalone fed the M. oliefera-based diet showed significantly higher carcass protein (70% dry weight) and lipid (5%) than the other treatments.

Transition between these morphologically and ecologically distinct phases typically occurs when the developmentally competent larva comes into contact with a species-specific environmental cue. This cue acts as a morphogenetic signal that induces the completion of the postlarval/juvenile/adult developmental program at metamorphosis. The development of competence often occurs hours to days after the larva is morphologically mature. In the non-feeding - lecithotrophic - larvae of the ascidian Herdmania curvata and the gastropod mollusc Haliotis asinina, gene expression patterns in pre-competent and competent stages are markedly different, reflecting the different developmental states of these larval stages. For example, the expression of Hemps, an EGF-like signalling peptide required for the induction of Herdmania metamorphosis, increases in competent larvae. Induction of settlement and metamorphosis results in further changes in developmental gene expression, which apparently is necessary for the complete transformation of the larval body plan into the adult form.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036368506

For 131 days, abalone were fed diets containing three different levels of protein (42%, 36% and 32%), each level containing two ranges of starch:lipid ratios (1.5-1.8 or 3.2-3.6). The gross energy content of the diets ranged from 4.26-3.68 kcal/g. Within a particular protein level, growth did not differ significantly. When dietary protein levels exceeded 32%, a trend of higher growth of abalone was observed for dietary treatments that contained lower levels of lipid (higher starch to lipid ratios). The amount of protein consumed daily for the 32% dietary protein is apparently insufficient to meet requirements for energy and maximum growth. No notable diet-dependent differences in the proportional composition (dry weight) of the shell and the soft tissue, and the energy content of the soft tissue were observed. Daily food intake and consumed energy were significantly different among treatments, being inversely related to the calculated P:E ratios. The increased consumption may have been somewhat overestimated because of loss arising from lower water stability of the diets. Ammonia excretion ranged from 7.9-4.8 μg NH 4+ /h /g abalone but was not significantly different among treatments except for the treatment containing 32% crude protein and a low carbohydrate:lipid ratio. Specific Dynamic Action (SDA) comprised nearly 50% of measured oxygen consumption and did not significantly differ among treatments. Respiration increased during the night showing a typical circadian pattern reported in Haliotis genera. Measured mucus production did not vary among treatments. Carbohydrate preferentially serves as the principal energy source and a consistent amount of dietary protein is also used as an energy source, regardless of dietary protein content. Within a developed energy budget, approximately 70% of the ingested energy was lost through feces, and approximately 25% of the ingested energy was metabolized, with 7% to 10% channeled to growth. A direct determination of available digestible energy was not possible because of the inability to collect sufficient feces to estimate fecal energy. The results suggest that practical diets should include levels of dietary protein that are approximately 35% protein to meet requirements for energy and maximum growth. In addition, carbohydrates seem to be the preferred energy source and lipid levels should be minimized to the extent that essential fatty acids requirements are met.",10.2983/0730-8000(2005)24[1179:GAEUOJ]2.0.CO;2,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746906250

The level of crude protein ranged from approximately 26% to 44% while the energy content remained constant at about 4.1 kcal g-1. Growth ranged from 3.63 to 12.33 mg day-1. The growth of abalone fed the 100 and 108 diets was significantly greater than that of each of the other diets. Protein efficiency ratio increased as the dietary protein content increased except for the T108 diet (44% crude protein). Abalone apparently consume food to satisfy an energy requirement. Caloric expenditure due to metabolism was estimated for abalone fed diets with protein ratios of 62, 85, 100. Energy loss due to respiration did not vary appreciably among abalone fed the different diets. The proportional distribution of dietary energy into fecal, digestible, growth, and metabolic energy was estimated for abalone fed these diets. Apparent dry matter digestibility was among the lowest for abalone fed the 100 P:E diet, but growth of abalone fed this diet was significantly higher than that of each of the other treatments except the 108 diet. Unexplained energy loss to achieve balance ranged from 7% to 28.5%, some of which is probably due to differential mucus and ammonia production.

Larvae in another group were maintained until individuals metamorphosed spontaneously. Metamorphosed individuals (postlarvae) were reared in the laboratory at 20 °C fed on a benthic diatom Cylindrotheca closterium or without any food in equivalent conditions. Metamorphosis, survival, and growth (determined from shell length) rates were measured. The percentage of individuals that had metamorphosed 2 days after the addition of GABA increased with the length of larval swimming period; larvae that were 5 and 19 days old when induced to metamorphose showed 19% (± 5.6; S.E.) and 96% (± 3.6) metamorphosis, respectively. The percentage of postlarvae that metamorphosed spontaneously increased after 17 days from fertilization and reached 96% (± 3.0) at 24 days postfertilization. Survival rates of fed postlarvae depended on larval swimming period. For larvae that swam for ≤ 15 days, more than 80% of postlarvae survived throughout the 20-day experimental period. In contrast, the survival rate was only 57% (± 2.9) for 19-day-old larvae. Postlarval growth rates did not differ significantly between larval swimming periods ≤ 15 days. However, the growth rate of postlarvae from 19-day-old larvae was significantly lower than that of ≤ 15-day-old larvae.

Twelve abalone farms, with an estimated investment of US$12 million, have since been established on the coast of South Africa, with a projected production of 500-800 tons. While Haliotis midae could reach a maximum size of about 200 mm shell length at an age of over 30 years in the wild, farm production is concentrating on an average size of 100 mm after 5 years. Growth rates of 0.08-4.5% body weight day-1 for abalone of 10-17 mm shell length have been found under stimulated farming conditions on formulated diets, while the corresponding feed conversion ratio (FCR) was 0.9-2.4. Growth rate, FCR and protein efficiency ratio decline at water temperatures above 20°C. Anaesthetics, for example magnesium sulphate, are used to prevent injury during removal from tanks. Prostrate diatoms, such as Cocconeis sublittoralis (Hendey), Amphora proteoides (Hustedt) and Achnanthes brevipes (Agardh) are preferred after the larval stage (5-7 days, depending on temperature) are finished. South Africa abalone growers prefer formulated feeds in pellet form, which is convenience and cost favourable to farm operations and management. Although fish meal has been found to be the most suitable protein source for inclusion in formulated diets, plant proteins such as soy bean meal, cottonseed meal and sunflower meal presented good growth and apparent protein digestibility. The parasite sabellid polychaete, Terebrasabella heterouncinata, recently named by Australian and American researchers, is indigenous to a variety of South African intertidal molluscs and impedes growth by causing irritation beneath the mantle in abalone. Prevention to some degree is possible by high standards of hygiene and husbandry of abalone in the tanks, but new techniques to control large infestations now include ultrasound. In spite of a reputation for toughness, abalone meat frozen immediately after shucking is tender relative to red meat.

In New South Wales changes in legal-sized and mature biomass will trigger management responses, in South Australia catch rates, size composition, and abundance indices provide target reference points, and in Tasmania, catch rates and catches have been used to provide triggers for management decisions. However, Victoria and Western Australia have yet to determine their reference points for abalone stock assessment. Victoria has been developing length-based fisheries models similar to those applied in New South Wales and is now confronted with the necessity of converting model outputs into decision-making criteria. A Victorian fishery management plan is also under development in which reference points will be specified within a risk-based matrix of catch control rules for quota adjustment Recent biodiversity conservation legislation, compelling fisheries management agencies in Australia to demonstrate that export fisheries managed under their jurisdictions are ecologically sustainable, has increased the urgency to establish these reference points. The application of this legislation draws upon the ""Principles and Criteria for Sustainable Fishing"" of the Marine Stewardship Council in London. We considered a range of alternative measures for reference points that may be useful as triggers and targets applied in a stochastic framework for management decisions. Although not a modeling output, one of the more consistent nonbiological signals of localized depletion in the Victorian fishery relates to spatial allocation of effort at the scale of reef complexes. Reductions in annual effort applied to a particular reef system invariably precede significant decreases in abundance indices with typically large coefficients of variation and in catch rates characterized by hyperstability. Victorian abalone divers have high daily catch expectations and allocate their effort accordingly. Empirical reference points, such as effort allocations, provide utility for fishery management and can be readily assimilated and adopted by industry. Consequently, we conclude that in addition to modeling outputs, maintenance of reef-scale effort allocation and daily catch expectations should form part of a suite of fishery performance indicators and target criteria for the Victorian blacklip abalone fishery.",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035718123

Diet was shown not to have a significant effect on the time in which the worms on live hosts reached their maximum size.

Despite diet having no effect on fecundity and offspring size, kelp-fed worms matured earlier. The maximum size of kelp-fed worms was unaffected by the absence of a live host, suggesting that the worms do not rely on the host for food. The absence of a live host reduced the growth and sexual maturation rates of worms. There was no difference in the size of offspring in the two treatments, but fewer worms matured sexually and fewer broods were produced on ""shells only"" than on live hosts. The lower growth rate and reproductive output of worms on ""shells only"" may be due to the diversion of energy from growth and reproduction to burrow expansion.",10.1080/07924259.2002.9652761,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036710497

The first experiment was set up to determine if nutrient levels used for co-culture of the Rhodophyte, Pacific dulse (Palmaria mollis) directly affected abalone growth. No significant differences (ANOVA; P=0.117) were found in growth of abalone cultured in either ambient seawater alone or seawater supplemented with different NaNO3 loads (1176, 1765, 2353, and 2942 μM day-1 NO3-N), NaH2PO4 (83.3 μM day-1 PO4 -), and a modified version of Guillard and Ryther's [Gran. Can. J. Microbiol. 8, (1962) 229] f medium containing Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Mo, and Co. The second experiment was designed to determine the effect of different nutrient levels on the nutritional value of P. mollis when fed to abalone. P. mollis was cultured with different NaNO3 loads (1176, 1765, 2353, and 2942 μM day-1 NO3-N) and NaH2PO4 (83.3 μM day-1 PO4-) in the presence or absence of f medium trace metals (Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Mo, and Co). H. discus hannai showed the highest LGR and SGR when fed on P. mollis supplemented with nitrate loads ranging from 1176 to 2353 μM day-1 NO3-N. In contrast, H. rufescens showed the highest linear growth rate (LGR) when fed on P. mollis supplemented with higher nitrate loads of 2353 to 2942 μM day-1 NO3-N, while nitrate load had no significant effect on specific growth rate (SGR). Both abalone species grew better on P. mollis supplied with 0.75f+Zn (day-1) metal solution [Gran. Can. J. Microbiol. 8 (1962) 229] compared to those without trace metal additions, with H. discus hannai showing a further improvement in food conversion efficiencies (FCE).

SAPPS was tested in trial 1 using two commercially available artificial diets, Adam and Amos (Adam; supplied by Adam and Amos, Mt Barker, SA, Australia) and Cosmo (Cos; supplied by Cosmo, Matsuyama, Japan), against the diatom biofilm method (Diatom). In trial 2, SAPPS was tested against the previous production system (PPS, used by Stott et al. 2002). Larvae were induced to metamorphose and the resulting postlarvae were on-grown in 10-L flow-through tanks for 28 days in their respective treatments. The final survival of postlarvae was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the SAPPS-Cos group (56.7 ± 11.15%) than in the Diatom (9.4 ± 2.7%) and SAPPS-Adam groups (8.5 ± 1.1%). The final length of postlarvae in SAPPS-Cos (1065 ± 73 μm) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those in the other two treatments (average of 841-883 μm). In trial 2 the metamorphosis rate was improved by using Spirulina platensis.

Stott A.E.; Takeuchi T.; Koike Y.,An alternative culture system for the hatchery production of abalone without using livefood,2004,Aquaculture,236,1-Apr,341,360,,"Stott's Abalone Postlarval Production System (SAPPS) was developed to replace livefood as the primary means of settling and growing out abalone seed. Culture plates are initially sprayed with microalgal powder/agar gel solution to induce larval settlement. Abalone seed are then raised on an artificial diet/agar gel solution which is sprayed directly onto the culture plates. This study was conducted to test SAPPS on a commercial scale against the diatom biofilm method and two further trials were conducted to investigate the optimum feeding frequency and agar concentration for SAPPS. A total of 100,000 larval Haliotis diversicolor aquatilis were induced to settle onto 90 mucus conditioned commercial rearing plates (5 racks×18 plates each) in 1500-l tanks to test two treatments; diatom biofilm method and SAPPS. The trial was conducted over a 6-week period and the temperature averaged 24.2±1.0°C. Settlement was similar on all plates in the two treatments. The settlement rate per plate was 17,820±8460 for the diatom biofilm and 17,280±6390 for SAPPS. The postlarval growth rate on the SAPPS plates was over 50% higher than the growth rate on the diatom plates. The final length of postlarvae was significantly higher (p<0.05) on SAPPS plates (3281±573 μm) than on diatom biofilm plates (2231±314 μm). Furthermore, the survival of postlarvae was also five times higher on SAPPS (51.7%) compared with diatom biofilm (10.6%). SAPPS plates were heavily colonized by marine bacteria which may have acted as a food source for early postlarvae and assisted in the breakdown of polysaccharides. The whole body protein of juveniles was 17.2% in SAPPS compared to 13.3% in diatom biofilm which may suggest that artificial diet was a more balanced and complete nutrient source than diatom biofilm. Smaller scale trials were conducted over 25 days to determine optimum concentration of agar (2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 mg/ml) and also to determine specific feed frequency (daily, every second day and every third day). There was no significant difference (p>0.05) in survival rate in both trials. However, the growth rate of postlarvae at 2.5 mg/ml agar was significantly lower than the other treatments and the leaching rate (% weight loss of food) was double that of agar concentrations 5.0-10.0 mg/ml. Growth rate was highest (p<0.05) in the feed frequency experiment for postlarvae fed daily and lowest for those fed every third day. The results suggested that agar concentration was optimal at between 5.0 and 10.0 mg/ml with plates being sprayed daily. SAPPS has potential to be used in industry depending on the development of a mechanized, cost-efficient system for spraying the plates. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The levels of ammonium nitrogen and nitrite in the water of coculture groups were lower than those in control group (abalone alone) throughout the experiment. No mass mortality occurred in any groups, but abalone in coculture groups showed significantly better growth performance and higher survival, suggesting that coculture of juvenile abalone with sea cucumber, a deposit-feeding species, can reduce the levels of inorganic nitrogen in the water and consequently enhance growth. This coculture appears to be beneficial and could be developed as an alternative culture method in abalone farms during the heating-aided overwintering period. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Brood stock abalone were induced to spawn by exposure to air for 2 h at 27°C. Female abalone spawned a mean of 76,530 eggs. Fertilised eggs measured 180 μm in diameter. Seventy percent survival was obtained during larval rearing. Larvae passed trochophore, veliger, gliding and creeping stages and were induced to settle on a mat of diatoms containing Nitszchia sp. and Navicula sp. The larval rearing period of H. varia ranged from 4 to 6 days at 27°C. The settled spat vigorously fed on the diatom mat until the 50th day of postfertilisation and coralline red algal film, until the 70th day of postfertilisation.

Juvenile abalones were reared on three algal diets such as coralline red algae, green filamentous algae and Ulva lactuca from the 71st to 200th day of postfertilisation. Those fed with coralline algae showed best and consistent growth. Shell colour of juveniles was affected by diet.

To better understand the effects of dietary zinc on the shell deposition, the newly grown shell (NS) was separated from the old shell (OS) after a 16-week rearing period. Mineralogical (aragonite, calcite and dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2]) and chemical (Zn, Fe, Mg, Cu and Sr) compositions in both NS and OS were analyzed. Soluble matrix proteins (SMP) were extracted from both OS and NS, followed by amino acid composition analyses. The results showed that mineralogical and chemical compositions in OS were not significantly influenced by dietary zinc. In NS, however, increasing dietary zinc significantly decreased aragonite content, but significantly increased calcite content. Concentrations of Zn and Fe in NS significantly increased with dietary zinc. Patterns of amino acid compositions in NS significantly changed with dietary zinc levels.

Most individual abalone showed active feeding behavior, but there was considerable variation in growth of abalone between different algae and developmental stages of abalone. The growth rates of smaller post-larvae (0.4-1.2 mm SL) fed gametophytes and juvenile sporophytes of L. japonica, or A. longipes were significantly lower than those fed C. closterium.

Postlarvae in all developmental stages fed C. closterium actively grazed and efficiently ingested diatom cells. However, the relative dietary value of C. closterium decreased as abalone grew, probably because feeding efficiency on this diatom decreased because of its low cell volume and thin film-like colonies. Smaller post-larvae (0.4-1.2 mm SL) grazed repeatedly on the same surface of gametophytes, juvenile sporophytes of L. japonica, or on A. longipes without detaching these algae, whereas larger post-larvae (>1.8 mm SL) detached and ingested large amounts of whole cells of these algae.

Abalone fed the basal diet without iron supplementation exhibited significantly lower survival and carcass protein than the other groups. The average weight gain rate (WGR, %), daily increment in shell length (DISL, μm/day), and soft-body iron concentration (SB iron, μg/g) of the abalone were significantly affected by dietary treatment, and responded in broken-line models to increases in dietary iron levels from the two iron sources. The optimal levels of dietary iron using FeMet and FeSO4 as the supplemental iron sources, determined by broken-line regression analysis, on the basis of maximum WGR, were 62.79 and 58.35 mg/kg, respectively.

Despite the evolutionary distance between mollusks and mammals, the sequence identity was 40% including 12 conserved cysteines. However, the residues which were suggested recently to bind IGF-II in a complex with IGFBP-5 were conserved only partially. Nevertheless, perlustrin bound human IGFs with KD ∼10-7 M. This was the same affinity range as measured before for the interaction of isolated IGFBP-5 N-terminal domains with IGFs. Moreover, perlustrin bound bovine insulin with only approximately two- to sevenfold lower affinity than IGFs. Sequence similarity and growth factor binding identified perlustrin unequivocally as a member of the IGFBP family, the first found in an invertebrate biomineral. Nacre is known to contain proteinaceous factors which promote bone formation in vitro and in vivo. Bone contains IGFBPs which influence bone metabolism in many ways by modulating either IGF effects or IGF independently.

No differences in proportions of crude protein, crude lipids, and moisture content were found between diets. Survival of juveniles during the feeding trial was not affected by the dietary treatments.

This is the basis of least-cost linear computer programs. However, experiments conducted on pigs and rats have revealed that the inclusion of dietary fiber in manufactured feeds may result in a depression of the digestibility coefficients of the constituent ingredients. Thus, feeds that are formulated by adding the digestibility coefficients of each constituent ingredient, derived by the direct measurement of the digestibility of each ingredient when incorporated into base diets, may lead to an overestimation of the digestibility of nutrients in the manufactured feed. A series of isonitrogenous diets containing semolina, fishmeal, barley, lupin kernel meal and various combinations of these ingredients were fed to juvenile greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) to determine the apparent fecal digestibilities of N, amino acids, and gross energy. The digestibility coefficients of the single-ingredient diets were used to predict the digestibility of N, amino acids, and gross energy in casein in the mixed diets. The calculated digestibility values for casein did not differ significantly between diets. Thus, the apparent fecal digestibilities of N, amino acids, and gross energy of the constituent ingredients were not affected by varying ingredient combinations in the diets. Apparent fecal digestibility values for the chosen ingredients are additive when they are incorporated into compound feeds for abalone and so are good descriptors of nutritive value and can be used with confidence in diet formulations.",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032447371
Fitzhugh K.; Rouse G.W.,A remarkable new genus and species of fan worm (Polychaeta: Sabellidae: Sabellinae) associated with marine gastropods,1999,Invertebrate Biology,118,4,357,390,,"A new genus and species of South African sabellid polychaete, Terebrasabella heterouncinata, is described. The species lives in burrows in living gastropod shells and was first discovered in 1993 in red abalone aquaculture facilities in southern California. Shell abnormalities in cultured abalones, caused by heavy sabellid infestations, raised concerns about its potential impact on native gastropods. The species has eight thoracic and three abdominal setigers, and is distinguished by the following features: 1) two pairs of radioles; 2) uncini in thoracic setigers 2-6 acicular, with main fang surmounted by small teeth, companion setae present; 3) uncini in thoracic setigers 7-8 avicular, with no main fang and teeth in a rasp-like (serpuliform) arrangement; 4) abdominal uncini acicular with main fang surmounted by small teeth. Members of T. heterouncinata are simultaneous hermaphrodites, with sperm produced in setiger 8 and oocytes in setigers 9-10. Sperm have an elongate nucleus and short midpiece. Young are brooded in the adult burrow to a late larval stage with about 6 setigers, but are non-feeding, lacking a branchial crown. Released larvae crawl over the surface of the mollusc host shell and settle under the shell lip, in contact with the mantle tissue. Larvae are subsequently covered by shell from the host, forming the burrow. Crown formation and feeding commence after burrow formation. Cladistic analyses support the hypothesis that Terebrasabella is most closely related to Amphiglena, as part of the apomorphic Sabellinae clade, (Laonome (Terebrasabella, Amphiglena)). The early release of late-stage, non-feeding larvae, which enables the association of T. heterouncinata with gastropods, appears to have been independently derived in this species as well as several Amphiglena species.",10.2307/3227007,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033480285
Troynikov V.S.; Gorfine H.K.,Alternative approach for establishing legal minimum lengths for abalone based on stochastic growth models for length increment data,1998,Journal of Shellfish Research,17,3,827,831,,"Stochastic parametrization of length-increment data was used to estimate the distribution of maximum length of abalone populations. The distribution of maximum length provides important information for establishing a legal minimum length (LML). Legal minimum length is commonly used to optimize yield and/or reproductive potential in abalone populations. Although choice of LML is generally based on deterministic estimates of average values of growth parameters, there is strong evidence in abalone growth data that distributions of maximum length in abalone populations have large variances and proportions of abalone that cannot attain the LML. However, deterministic estimates give no indication of the proportion of individuals that may or may not attain a specific LML. Consequently, deterministic estimates of growth can be misleading and may result in setting inappropriate LMLs. Length-increment data from tagged individuals in three H. rubra populations in Victoria, Australia were analyzed using new stochastic versions of the Gompertz model reparameterized for tagging data. Outputs from the stochastic Gompertz model for tagging data include distributions of L(∞) that show the proportion of abalone in each studied population that were unlikely to attain the LML and enter the stock. It is presently unknown whether this level of protection will ensure long-term sustainability. The proportion conserved may also be viewed as lost yield to the fishery. If the proportion of abalone required to provide sufficient egg production for sustaining a particular population is known, then the stochastic Gompertz model for tagging data provides additional information to select an appropriate LML that balances reproductive output against yield to the fishery.",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032447374

Equal numbers of 1 : 1 female and male abalone were stocked in 24 units, 60 L tanks with eight replicate tanks per dietary treatment. Reproductive performance, e.g. number of spawnings, instantaneous fecundity and egg hatching rates, was monitored over 270 days. The mean number of spawnings was not significantly different among treatments. The mean instantaneous fecundity and percent hatching rates were significantly higher in abalone fed D2 or D3 compared to those given Dl. Survival of abalone broodstock fed Dl was, however, significantly higher at 88% than those fed either D2 or D3 at 75%.

The relationships of oxygen consumption rate with shell length and body weight were all power function. The oxygen consumption between 16 o'clock and 4 o'clock (night time) was higher than 4 o'clock to 16 o'clock (day time), with a peak at 18~20 o'clock. At same temperature, the daily feeding rate of abalone and its body weight showed a relationship of power function. The daily relative feeding rate was increased with temperature. The rates of daily relative feeding and growth were decreased with increasing shell length and body weight. The total conversing efficiency of abalone on kelp (Laminaria japonica) was 53.0% at 14~20°C.

Forty-eight previously frozen stomachs from wild abalone adults were thawed and individually homogenized. Four cultured abalone adults maintained under a balanced diet containing cellulose were killed and the fresh stomach samples processed. Cellulase activity was estimated through the production of glucose, incubating the homogenate from each organism with cellulose. To determine the effect of bacteria, each stomach was incubated (at 25°C for 20 h) in a completely randomized design, with and without an antibiotic mixture. For a time series measurement (exp. 2), four homogenates from wild abalone were used; the incubation mixture was followed up taking samples at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 20, 32, 64 and 72 h. The latter samples were also used to measure the enzymatic activity before and after a 72-h incubation, in the absence of antibiotics (exp. 3). Initial bacterial counts in the wild abalone homogenates were 459 colonies per mL. In the presence of the antibiotic mixture, no bacterial growth was observed. Initial cellulase activity was 1.6 Units. Cellulose degradation figures were low, even in the absence of antibiotics, indicating the low dependence of abalone on the nutrients derived from the digestion of the cell walls. Still, the addition of antibiotics depressed the digestion of cellulose (14.5 vs. 10.2%), suggesting the importance of live bacteria in the digestion process, and that the majority of the degraded cellulose is perhaps acted upon by endogenous enzymes. The time series experiment of samples from wild abalone, with and without antibiotics, showed quadratic effects on cellulose digestion y = 7.55 + .29h - .005 h2 (r2 = .2212), but no significant differences between treatments. The gradual increase in the digestion of cellulose, followed by a plateau is similar to what happens in ruminant digestion. The initial and final enzyme activity without antibiotics showed a significant reduction of 41.1% for the wild abalone whereas in cultured abalone a 50.9% significant reduction was observed. It seems that the cellulase complex enzymes present in the homogenates remain active after 72 h of incubation, even though their activity is lowered by about one half. Although the use of antibiotics assure the absence of live bacteria in the incubation mixture, the cellular enzymes possibly freed by the effect of the antibiotics could still be active for up to 72 h after the microbes are no longer viable. Thus the enzymatic activity attributed to the stomach itself could still be confounded.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034839791

Radula morphology was examined by SEM, and compared with that of competent larvae (260-280 μm shell length (SL)) and adults (125-130 mm SL). Larvae (130 °C.days old) had a well-formed radula with ~10 rows of teeth. Each row comprised 1 rachidian tooth, 2 pairs of lateral teeth, and 1 pair of marginal teeth. The number of rows of teeth increased to 26-29 by ~500 μm SL (Day 10 post-settlement) and stayed at that level throughout the post-larval period (maximum size/age observed was 2.7 mm SL at Day 60). Marginal teeth were added steadily to give ~30 pairs per row at ~2.5 mm SL (compared to 60-80 in adults). Lateral teeth (L3-L5) were added between 1.0 and 1.7 mm SL to complete the adult complement. Progressive changes in the post-larval radula above 1-1.5 mm SL included: (1) reduction of serrations on the margins of rachidian and lateral teeth, particularly the more central (R, L1, L2) teeth; (2) increased spacing between adjacent rows of teeth; (3) lengthening of the outer lateral teeth (L3-L5) making them larger and taller than the central (R, L1, L2) teeth. The clearance angle of rachidian and lateral teeth was variable, but generally increased as post-larvae grew. Post-larvae < 1 mm SL had highly curved teeth and apparent clearance angles around or below 0°. Larger post-larvae had positive clearance angles. These developments suggest that the teeth of post-larvae <1 mm SL probably function as 'scoops' which slide across the surface collecting small diatoms and other fine, loose particles. Radulae of post-larvae > 1 mm SL become more suitable for collecting larger particles, and gouging feeding substrata.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033389816

For all treatments, paua held inside a building with constant darkness showed significantly better growth than did those kept outside under natural (although shaded) light. Shell increments were 20-30% greater inside, but weight gains were only half this. Paua fed either of the artificial foods consistently grew better than did those fed dried Gracilaria, and growth was always better at lower stocking densities. However, variable and often high mortality (40-50%), both inside and outside, made it difficult to use the experimental results on growth to determine optimal on-growing conditions. The implications of this for further experiments and for designing appropriate systems for on-growing paua in the warm waters of northeastern New Zealand are discussed.",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032444495

It seems likely that all three stresses were equally effective at inhibiting mitochondrial ATP formation, which may account for the similarity in flux increase, possibly to maximal rates of AK-mediated ATP formation.

The goals were to achieve nutrient recycling, reduced water use, reduced nutrient discharge and high yields. Effluents from Japanese abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) culture tanks drained into a pellet-fed fish (Sparus aurata) culture tank. The fish effluent drained into macroalgal (Ulva lactuca or Gracilaria conferta) culture, and biofilter tanks. Algal production fed the abalone. The system was monitored to assess productivity and nitrogen partitioning over a year. The fish grew at 0.67% day-1, yielding 28-kg m-2 year-1. The nutrients excreted by the fish supported high yields of U. lactuca (78-kg m-2 year-1) and efficient (80%) ammonia filtration. Gracilaria functioned poorly. Ulva supported an abalone growth rate of 0.9% day-1 and a length increase of 40-66 μm day-1 in juveniles, and 0.34% day-1 and 59 μm day-1 in young adults. Total abalone yield was 9.4 kg year-1. A surplus of seaweed was created in the system. Ammonia-N, as a fraction of total feed-N was reduced from 45% in the fish effluents to 10% in the post-seaweed discharge.

Grazing rates for rhodophytes, Gracilaria sp. and Hymenocladia sanguinea exceeded those on phaeophytes, Macrocystis pyrifera and Lessonia variegata. The assimilation efficiency of paua feeding on Gracilaria sp. was the highest of the four species tested (85%).

Laboratory experiments investigated the effects of density on the feeding and growth rate of juvenile paua, initial length 35-45 mm, over a year. Although feeding rates were relatively constant with increasing density, annual length increment decreased. At densities greater than 40 individuals per cubicle (400 m-2), there was no length increase and individuals lost weight. The highest growth rate was found at the lowest density, where an annual length increment of 9.2 mm was about half that recorded from field populations.

Individuals on the diatom substratum died by the end of the second week, with a mean shell length during the second week of 481.6 μm. Post-larvae on the diatom substratum and on the mucus substratum did not reach 800 μm in shell length; the size at which they are able to utilize the cell contents of C. scutellum var. parva. In contrast, on the diatom and mucus substratum, 70.0% of the individuals survived to the end of the experimental period (4 weeks). Individuals on the diatom and mucus substratum grew well over the entire experimental period and reached approximately 1.4 mm in shell length 4 weeks after settlement. Post-larvae reared on the diatom and mucus substratum grew to more than 800 μm by feeding initially on the trail mucus of conspecific juveniles, which was probably supplemented with extracellular diatom mucus and decomposed cells of the diatom. Once they reached about 800 μm, they were able to access diatom cell contents.",10.1016/S0044-8486(96)01524-4,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030815929

We demonstrated first that after 40-hr labeling, the de novo synthesis of collagen in the cell layer of cultured hemocytes represents 9.48 ± 1.25% with respect to the total [3H]proline-labeled protein synthesis. In addition, IGF-I elicited a significant stimulation of collagen synthesis in cultured hemocytes in a dose-dependent manner from 10-10 to 10-8 M. The maximal stimulation (10-9 M) induced an increase of 286 ± 56% with respect to 100% control. By immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting, we showed that hemocytes present immunoreactive molecules to antibodies directed against the type I fibrillar collagen. In addition, using as a probe Hf 677 corresponding to a human proα1(I) collagen cDNA and which encompasses the (Gly-X-Y) repeated sequence found in all Metazoa, four collagen transcripts of approximately 6.4, 5, 2.2, and 2 kb in length have been detected. These data suggest the presence of fibrillar type I collagen in hemocytes and are compatible with the concept that these cells are involved in the extracellular matrix deposition, a cardinal function in tissue repair as well as in developmental processes. Our model may appear as an excellent system to study the role of growth factors on the regulation of collagen synthesis by molluscan hemocytes.

Abalone grew significantly faster in tubes and cages (mean length increase 61 ± 10.7 μm and 54 ± 5.3 μm day-1 respectively) than in barrels (mean length increase 39 ± 3.3 μm day-1). Abalone grown in tubes and fed a diet of Makara grew significantly faster than abalone grown in tubes and fed a diet produced by Coast Biologicals. Abalone in cages fed a diet produced by Coast Biologicals grew significantly faster than abalone in cages fed Makara. The difference in growth produced by the two diets may be related to improved food availability in cages throughout the feeding period. Mortality was high in all structures (66% of the entire experimental population) and did not differ significantly among structure and diet treatments. Mortalities were thought to be caused by a combination of shell infestations (by burrowing worms) and silty water conditions within the grow-out structures. The commercial food conversion ratio was used to compare the performance of diets within structures. Mean values ranged from 13.9 ± 5.6 for poe grown in barrels and fed Makara to 2.9 ± 0.0003 for abalone grown in tubes and fed Makara.

Both stability and pellet toughness were influenced more by the protein source than by the type and concentration of the binder, as diets containing abalone viscera silage lost 20% dry matter, compared to the 10% lost in diets containing fish meal. However, nutrient leaching was not affected by the phycocolloid concentration. This result coincides with previous reports that leaching speed does not depend on stability. In general, all the binders used were effective at low concentrations (0.5%); therefore, the use of phycocolloids at low concentrations is recommended.

Eight purified diets were formulated to provide a series of graded levels of menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB) (0-320 mg kg-1 diet). The brown alga, Laminaria japonica, was used as a control diet. Abalone juveniles of similar size (mean weight 1.18±0.04 g; mean shell length 18.65±0.18 mm) were distributed in a flow-through system using a completely randomized design with nine treatments and three replicate groups per treatment. Animals were hand-fed the appropriate diets once daily at 17:00 for a 120-day period. Survival and carcass composition were not significantly affected by the dietary treatments (P > 0.05). Significantly lower growth rate was found in abalone fed diet supplemented with antibiotic (suphaguanidine) than in those fed the other diets, but no significant difference in growth rate related to dietary level of MSB was observed. The concentrations of menaquinone-4 (MK-4) in muscle and viscera increased with increasing dietary MSB up to 10 mg kg-1. No phylloquinone (PK) was detected in tissues except that the abalone fed the control diet, Laminaria japonica, produced a relatively high level of PK. It seemed to be that the 10-mg MSB kg-1 diet is sufficient to that allowing the maintenance of 'steady-state' tissue concentration in juvenile abalone. Dietary MSB was converted to MK-4 in abalone.

Lapota D.; Rosen G.; Chock J.; Liu C.H.,"Red and green abalone seed growout for reseeding activities off point loma, California",2000,Journal of Shellfish Research,19,1,431,438,,"California has a statewide closure on harvest of any abalone species from San Diego County north to San Francisco. Prior to closure, harvests of the main species that compose the fishery (the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens Swainson 1822; the green abalone, Haliotis fulgens Philippi 1845; and the pink abalone, Haliotis corrugata Gray 1828) had plummeted to an all-time low of several hundred thousand pounds per year. Overfishing and several diseases identified recently in abalone are creating concern within the industry with respect to the recovery of the fishery. One method being considered to restore the fishery on a limited basis is reseeding. Reseeding success is dependent on many factors, including planting location and techniques of seed placement. Other important factors include the abundance and nutritive quality of macroalgae (kelp) available to the abalone, the seawater temperature requirement of the species being seeded, the size of the seed being planted, and the presence of potential predators within the seed site. In this study, we observed that shell growth and weight gain in juvenile red and green abalone are temperature-dependent. When constant, elevated temperatures are maintained, growth rates improved as compared to growth rates in animals kept at the lower temperatures normally found. More growth in juvenile red abalone was observed at 19 °C, with an average daily shell growth of 0.1 mm/day. Previous work suggested that Egregia laevigata, a brown kelp was a superior food source for juvenile abalone; however, the growth rates of red abalone fed Egregia increased minimally compared to growth rates of juvenile red abalone fed another brown kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. Maximum sustained shell growth of 0.16 mm/day in juvenile green abalone was observed at a culture temperature of 21 °C. Extrapolations of these growth rates for an entire year indicate growth of 36 mm/y for red abalone and 60 mm/y for green abalone. Growth predictions based on laboratory-reared juveniles will vary from those observed in wild populations since seawater temperatures are not static along the coast and may vary as much as 10-12 °C during the year. The nutritional value of kelp and other algae may be as important as temperature in the effect on growth observed in the laboratory and in the field. Increased growth rates exhibited by juvenile red abalone during the period from January through April 1977 may be reflective of changing nutrient ratios or levels in kelp that are otherwise limiting during reduced or non-upwelling months. We are presently culturing hatchery-produced red and green abalone seed for eventual planting in the U.S. Department of the Interior's Cabrillo National Monument. The seed are approximately 45 mm in size and are fed a mixed kelp diet. They will be transplanted when they are approximately 75-100 mm in size. Reseeding success assessed by annual dive surveys should help determine if planting larger animals increases survival of brood stock and increases recruitment within the monument area.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033845881

Food was generally given every other day at a rate of 30% and 3% of total body weight for Gracilaria tenuistipitata and artificial diet, respectively. Survival was 64.3-71.4% and 61.4-78.6% in the Gracilaria and artificial diet, respectively. Growth of abalone placed on the top tier was inferior to those placed on the middle and bottom tiers. In the first 33 days, the growth rate of H. diversicolor supertexta fed Gracilaria and the artificial diet was 61-101 and 105-163 μm/day, respectively. The abalone fed an artificial diet gained twice as much total body weight as those fed Gracilaria after 96 days. The overall growth rate of abalone fed an artificial diet was 24.4, 47.7, and 47.9 mg/day, or 1.8, 2.2, and 2.2 times higher than abalone fed Gracilaria, on the top, middle, and bottom tiers, respectively.

Dulse culture conditions differed by seawater volume exchange rate (1, 6, or 35 d-1) and supplemental illumination (0 or 24 h d-1), creating a variety of dulse morphologies, biochemical compositions, and palatabilities for red abalone. The results of this study agreed with those of previous studies, showing dulse to be of high nutritional quality for abalone, with a relatively high protein content when compared with other macroalgae. Specific growth rates (SGR) of abalone fed on all dulse diets were higher than those of abalone fed on kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana). In general, abalone grew faster on dulse cultured with supplemental illumination. Protein content of dulse (10.85-18.22% dry wt.), however, was directly dependent on seawater volume exchange per day, with highest protein levels observed in dulse cultured with 35 volume exchanges d-1.

Dietary overlap between three adjacent 10 cm size groups is high. No-choice, two-species-choice and multiple-choice field experiments showed that, within the Mollusca, the wrasse prefers chitons and abalone to other gastropods and limpets; crabs and shrimps are high, and echinoderms are low, on the preference list. A comparison of prey consumed with the relative abundance of prey groups shows that the wrasse takes prey more or less in proportion to its abundance, with variation in this pattern attributed to prey defences and predator choice. A long-term study showed that per capita consumption of cryptic abalone increased with increasing abalone density, suggesting a functional response of wrasse to the density of a preferred prey. The wrasse is a diurnal predator with a defined home range that increases with increasing size of wrasse. Foraging activity commences soon after dawn, reaches a peak during mid morning, declines during the afternoon, and ceases at dusk.

The two fast-growth strains were efficiently digested by post-larvae, with 93-94% of live cells ruptured during passage through the gut. Two of the remaining strains could not be ingested during the growth experiment because the cells were too large (A. longipes-2) or too strongly attached (Cocconeis pseudomarginata). For the other four strains (Navicula britannica, Nav. ramosissima, Navicula sp. and Nitzschia ovalis) most cells passed through the gut alive. Survival rate was highest on the two fast-growth strains, and survival was positively correlated with both growth rate (r = 0.73, P < 0.05) and digestion efficiency (r = 0.80, P < 0.05) of diatoms. The digestion efficiency of diatom strains appears to be an important factor determining their dietary value. Digestion efficiency can be influenced by diatom morphology, attachment strength, frustule strength and post-larval age/size. Isolation and use of digestible strains may improve hatchery culture of abalone.",10.1016/S0044-8486(97)00223-8,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032518625

In all the cases, we isolated several strains of the genus Nitzschia and one strain of Amphiprora paludosa var. hyalina. Monospecific and non-axenic cultures of each strain were maintained on batch cultures under white and blue light at high (150 μE m-2 s-1) photon fluence rates. For all the diatoms we observed that the growth rate (μ) in the second or third day of culture had high values of duplicated strains per day. We compared the growth rate of these strains with a control specie Navicula incerta, a strain used as food in several abalone farms in México, and found similar growth rates in some of the cases. For each strain, a covariance analysis was used to compare growth using white versus blue light wavelength. No significant differences in growth were observed between the two light conditions. We obtained high growth rate for Amphiprora paludosa var. hyalina with almost double values of those obtained with of the control species N. incerta and the others strains: N. thermalis var. minor, N. fonticola var. pelagica and N. frustulum var. perminuta. The sub-strains of N. laevis exhibit equal growth rate and nearly 50% less than that of N. incerta. Our results suggest that some strains of benthic diatoms offer a good potential for use in feeding abalone post-larvae, because they can be cultured under high light irradiance apparently without photoinhibition and may exhibit high growth rates and high cell concentrations.",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035717489

A diet rotation feeding scheme was designed to use less abundant algae, as well as the abundant kelp Ecklonia maxima. Rotation diets entailed feeding abalone on Ecklonia for 11 days of a 2-wk rotation cycle and on one of the less abundant algae species, or a mixture of the less abundant algae species, for the remaining 3 days. Six rotation diets and six single-species control diets were tested simultaneously over a 6-mo period. Shell length and body weight growths were ranked highest for the single-species diet Porphyra, but rotation diets were placed in the subsequent four ranking positions. Shell length growth rates varied between 27 and 38 μm day-1 for abalone fed rotation diets and between 15 and 53 μm day-1 for those fed single-species diets. Body weight growth rates varied between 34 and 55 mg day-1 for abalone fed rotation diets and between 9 and 74 mg day-1 for those fed the control diets.

The practical diets contained graded levels of protein from fish meal, shrimp meal, and soybean meal at 22 (diet 1), 27 (diet 2), and 32% (diet 3) with corresponding estimated metabolizable energy values of 3254, 3150, and 3090 kcal ME/kg diet. The amino acid profile and proximate analyses of muscle meat of the test animal and published nutrient requirements of other species of Haliotids were used as a basis for formulating and developing these practical diets. The diets were fed to abalone at 2-5% body weight once daily (1600 h) for biological evaluation in terms of weight gain (WG), increase in shell length (SL), specific growth rate (SGR), protein efficiency ratio (PER), feed conversion ratio (FCR) and for physical evaluation in terms of shell coloration of the animal. Natural food, Gracilariopsis baitinae (17% CP/2200 kcal ME/kg) (NF) fed ad libitum served as the control. Better growth rates, in terms of WG and SL, FCR and PER were noted in abalone fed the three formulated diets compared with those fed seaweed, G. baitinae. Abalone fed diets 3 (WG: 347%; SGR: 0.81; SL: 140%) and 2 (WG: 307%; SGR: 0.70; SL: 139%) showed significantly better growth rate than those fed diet 1 (WG: 252%; SGR: 0.51; SL: 132%). Natural food-fed abalone had the lowest WG (134%), SGR (0.06) and increase in SL (77%). Survival was generally high at 85-95% for all treatments. FCR (1.5-2.3) and PER (2.19-2.47) for animals fed the three diets were significantly better than for those fed natural food (0.10 PER and 6.98 FCR). Regression analysis showed the optimum protein level for juvenile abalone to be 27% with an energy level of 3150 kcal/kg ME.

Abalone exhibited seasonal variations in field activity with 20% of all individuals observed crawling during June to October, compared with <5% during December to February. In the laboratory, abalone exhibited diurnal as well as seasonal variation in activity. The laboratory activity budget showed that an average abalone spends 9.8 h day-1 quiescent, 12.0 h day-1 alert, 0.7 h day-1 feeding, and 1.5 h day-1 crawling during the summer, and 15.8 h day-1 quiescent, 5.5 h day-1 alert, 2.3 h day-1 feeding, and 0.4 h day-1 crawling during the winter. Videotapes of abalone made over 24-h periods revealed that abalone usually crawl at a rate of one shell length min-1. Locomotion is not continuous; rather, abalone stop and then start again, on average twice per meter. Components of the energy budget, C = F + U + P(g) + P(r) + R + M were measured during summer and winter months. None of the slopes of regressions of log10 energy (J day-1) on log10 mass (g) was significantly different between summer and winter for any of the energy budget components, except those of somatic growth on mass. Summer γ-intercepts were all significantly higher than winter γ-intercepts, indicating that energy consumption and expenditure were higher during the summer. Respiratory energy expenditure was the largest component of both summer and winter budgets.

The protein sources selected for the trial comprised four fishmeals, casein, spirulina, abalone viscera silage, brewery waste, torula yeast, carcass, sunflower and cotton seed meals. The results indicated that in terms of growth and feed efficiency, the fishmeals and spirulina were the most suitable candidates for use as primary protein sources in formulated feeds, and with the exceptions of the carcass meal and brewery waste, the remaining protein sources demonstrated promise as partial primary protein source replacements. Mean growth rates for the large and small abalone over the experimental period were 1.45 and 1.24 mm month-1 respectively. With respect to the larger size class of abalone, the smaller abalone displayed significantly reduced growth (F = 64.7, P < 0.0001), feed conversion ratio (F = 16.6, P < 0.0001) and protein efficiency (F = 26.8, P < 0.0001). Two-way analysis of variance revealed significant interactions between protein source, animal size and feed conversion ratio (F = 2.4, P < 0.01) and growth (F = 5.4, P < 0.05), thus indicating that qualitative differences exist between the dietary protein requirements of the juvenile and young adult abalone.",10.1046/j.1365-2109.2001.00572.x,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035025683

The possible inositol-synthesizing capacity of intestinal microflora was also examined. Seven semipurified diets were formulated to provide graded levels of myo-inositol (28.7-1020.1 mg/kg diet). A control diet, the basal diet supplemented with 4 g/kg tetracycline hydrochloride, was employed to suppress synthesis of myo-inositol by intestinal bacteria. Abalone juveniles of similar size (weight, 144.6 ± 0.8 mg; shell length, 10.92 ± 0.10 mm) were distributed in a flow-through system using a completely randomized design with eight treatments and three replicates per treatment. They were fed the appropriate diets once daily for 16 wk. Survival, growth, crude protein, lipid, moisture of whole soft body and visceral inositol content were independent of myo-inositol supplementation (P > 0.05). The addition of the antibiotic also did not affect the survival, growth and whole soft body composition. It indicated that intestinal microflora contributed little to the myo-inositol nutrition in abalone. The present study, for the first time, demonstrated de novo synthesis of myo-inositol in mollusks because the visceral tissue of abalone showed high levels of myo-inositol synthetase activities (combined activities of myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthetase and inositol-1-phosphatase), ranging from 74.0 to 98.2 μmol/(h·g protein). The enzyme activity significantly and negatively correlated with dietary myo-inositol level (r = -0.81).

Based on PCP toxicity in red abalone (6 h LC50 1.6 mg 1-1; 6 h NOEL = 0.8 mg 1-1), animals were exposed in flowing seawater (14°C) to a sublethal PCP concentration of 1.2 mg 1-1 and a water salinity of either 25, 35 or 45 ‰. Phosphagen changes in foot muscle were monitored by surface-probe localized 31P NMR. Upon PCP exposure, phosphoarginine (PA) levels declined and inorganic phosphate (Pi) levels concurrently increased. Dosing was terminated at a standard metabolic endpoint (MEP). defined as the time for the spectral peak height for Pi to reach one-half that of PA. This was on average 3.3 ± 0.2 and 6.8 ± 0.7 h at ambient salinity; 5.3 ± 0.7 and 7.1 ± 0.7 h for high salinity; and 4.0 ± 0.5 and 6.5 ± 1.0 h at low salinity, for red and black abalone, respectively. During recovery, all biochemical endpoints returned to normal; however, both onset and intensity of effects were influenced by changes in seawater salinity. Disposition of [U-14C]PCP in both species was also examined to determine if the effects observed with NMR had a kinetic basis. Three sets of abalone (n = 3) from each species were exposed to each salinity (25, 35 and 45 ‰), plus 1.2 mg 1-1 of [U-14C]PCP. Red abalone were exposed for 3.5 h and black abalone for both 3.5 and 6.5 h (they represent the lowest average MEP for both species). Residues were quantified via tissue digestion and liquid scintillation counting. The 3.5 h total concentration factors (TCFs) for red abalone were not significantly different among the three salinities (P > 0.05) and ranged from 104 to 133. However, low salinity seemed to deter the uptake of [U-14C]PCP in black abalone, as the TCF was over three times lower for abalone exposed to 25 ‰ at both 3.5 h (TCF = 19 ± 11) and 6.5 h (TCF = 38 ± 8) than at 35 ‰ (3.5 h TCF = 62 ± 6; 6.5 h TCP = 119 ± 11) and 45 % (3.5 h TCF = 67 ± 14, 6.5 h TCP = 115 ± 8). Furthermore, the 3.5 h TCP for red abalone exposed to PCP at all salinities was similar to the 6.5 h TCF for black abalone exposed at 35 and 45 ‰. Thus, black abalone appear to have greater resistance to the combined effects of PCP and salinity variations, which appears to be due to slower uptake of the biocide. While PCP is a potent uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, use of varying water salinities simulated an additional stress imposed on intertidal animals by transient or seasonal environmental changes. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Five diets were formulated to have the same total digestible-protein and energy contents, based on the apparent amino acid and energy digestibility coefficients of their ingredients. Despite similar nutrient profiles, the diets differed in their level of inclusion and combinations of four ingredients: semolina, soyflour, casein, and fishmeal. Diets were offered at two levels, subsatiation (0.01 g/d/abalone) and excess (0.1 g/d/abalone). Specific growth rates of shell length and wet weight of abalone were not significantly different among diets between feed levels. Thus, it seems that amino acid and energy digestibility coefficients of individual ingredients can be used effectively to formulate diets for abalone to desired levels of digestible protein and energy. The rate of food consumption of an abalone increased allometrically with its size dC(t)/dt = a(t)W(t)b, where C(t) and W(t) are, respectively, its total food consumption during a certain period of time up to time t, and its wet body weight at time t; a(t)s and bare its allometric parameters to be estimated.

Activity, expressed as percent change in Vo2 of isolated cells before and after the addition of glucose and amino acid substrates, was studied in relation to sex and to seasonal changes in gonad and digestive gland indices. At 3- to 4-mo intervals between May 1995 and July 1996, five collections of 10 adult abalone (equal sexes) were made from the West Coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Each animal's live mass (without shell) was recorded, and its gonad was aspirated from the digestive gland into a known volume (and mass) of seawater. The digestive gland was sliced free of its attachment, weighed, and related to shell-less body mass as percent digestive gland index (DGI). The gonad live mass was determined from the mass of aspirated mix of gonad and seawater, and related to shell-less body mass to give a percent gonad index (GI). Digestive gland cells were prepared and maintained in a special buffer, and their Vo2's measured in microrespirometers. There was no sex effect on seasonal DGI, but significant seasonal differences in DGIs correlated perfectly with metabolic activity of digestive-gland cells with glucose substrate. Thus, when digestive glands were largest relative to body size, metabolic activity of their cells was greatest. GIs were significantly higher for males than females. There was a significant seasonal effect on GIs, with values being high in Springtime before spawning (April to May, 10-11%) and low in winter (December, 6%), but with statistical overlap between these and summer values (July to August, 7-8%).

The fish silage was heated to reduce the level of hydrolysis and thereby increase the availability of nutrients. After 140 d of culture, growth rates of abalone fed the US- and HS-containing diets were 16.4 and 19.8 μm/d and were not significantly different despite greater leaching of protein and carbohydrate in the US-containing diet. Growth rates achieved with the US- and HS-containing diets were significantly lower than that achieved by feeding a commercially available diet used as a reference diet. Abalone that were fed the US- and HS-containing diets were then switched to a diet in which two-thirds of the total amount of silage was replaced with fishmeal. At the termination of the experiment, day 217, the abalone originally fed the US and HS diets had composite growth rates of 24.3 and 23.5 μm/d, while abalone that continued to be fed the commercial diet had a growth rate of 18.6 μm/d. Stability of the dry matter of the diets was not related to the level of protein leaching. Fish meal outperforms fish silage as a dietary protein source for abalone.

Shell length (SL) and protein per individual showed a rapid increase after Day 37. Enzyme activity was not detected on Day 7 (0.52 ± 0.01 mm SL, mean ± standard error) but by Day 17 (0.97 ± 0.02 mm SL), there was detectable activity from all enzymes. This indicates that a suite of enzymes for brown algal feeding is produced even by the postlarval stage. Changes in the total activity of CMCase, alginate lyase, and laminarinase showed a pattern similar to the growth rate, with a rapid increase observed after Day 37 (1.59 ± 0.04 mm SL). However, specific activities did not show the marked changes evident in the total activities, suggesting that the rapid increase of total activities observed after Day 37 was mainly caused by increased production of digestive enzyme with growth. Despite the negligible contents of cellulose and alginate in food of postlarvae, Days 37 and 46 postlarvae showed strong enzyme activity against these polysaccharides, suggesting that the appearance of enzyme activity during postlarval development does not require the presence of a substrate.",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032444050

The assessment strategy relied on application of various components of the sediment quality triad, combined with bioaccumulation measures, in a weight-of-evidence approach to sediment quality investigations. Results of bulk-phase chemical measurements, solid-phase amphipod toxicity tests, pore-water toxicity tests with invertebrate embryos, benthic community analyses (presented as a relative benthic index), and bioaccumulation measures indicated that inner harbor areas of this system are polluted by high concentrations of a mixture of sediment-associated contaminants and that this pollution is highly correlated with toxicity in laboratory experiments and degradation of benthic community structure. While 29% of sediment samples from this system were toxic to amphipods (Rhepoxynius abronius or Eohaustorius estuarius), 79% were toxic to abalone embryos (Haliotis rufescens) exposed to 100% pore-water concentrations. Statistical analyses indicated that amphipod survival in laboratory toxicity tests was significantly correlated with the number of crustacean species and the total number of species measured in the benthos at these stations. Triad measures were incorporated into a decision matrix designed to classify stations based on degree of sediment pollution, toxicity, benthic community degradation, and, where applicable, tissue concentrations in laboratory-exposed bivalves and feral fish.",10.1002/etc.5620200217,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035142490

The rates of weight gain, nutritional indices and body composition of both the smaller (0.2-1.0 g) and larger (7.0-14.0 g) abalone were significantly affected by the levels of protein and energy in the diets. Moreover, the two size classes of abalone differed in their responses to the diets. Maximum growth was achieved at a higher dietary protein level in the larger abalone (44%) than the smaller abalone (34%). The protein content of the larger abalone soft tissue was higher (ca. 7%) than the smaller abalone. Irrespective of the lipid content, the percentage of protein deposited by the larger abalone was highest in those fed the 34 and 44% protein diets, whereas that of the smaller abalone was highest for the 24 and 34% protein diets. The condition factor (CF) of small abalone was significantly higher for those fed the 24% protein diets in comparison to those fed the 34 and 44% protein diets, whereas the reverse was found in the larger abalone. It was concluded that the larger abalone had a higher protein requirement than the smaller abalone. Diets containing the highest level of dietary fat (10%) produced significantly lower growth rates and efficiencies of protein deposition in comparison to abalone fed he diets containing 6 and 2% fat, however, these trends were more marked among the small abalone size class. In addition, the feed conversion ratio (FCR) of small abalone fed the 10% fat diets was consistently poorer, but this trend was not present among the larger abalone whose FCR improved with an increasing PE ratio. It was concluded that a dietary lipid level of 10% is too high for H. midae to maintain a maximal growth rate.

Ten-day-old H. australis larvae had a slower rate of settlement than 5-day-old larvae. A high proportion of veliger larvae had the ability to prolong the searching phase of settlement and delay metamorphosis, even over prepared settlement surfaces but radula development continued at a similar rate in both settled and swimming larvae. In any one batch of larvae settlement was slow and asynchronous and post-settlement survival was low. Light was shown to influence the swimming behaviour of larvae in settlement tanks, with more larvae swimming in the dark than in the light. The implications of these behaviours are discussed in relation to larval and post-larval energetics and feeding. © 1999, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",10.1080/00288330.1999.9516876,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032867659

Co-culture conditions were altered by varying the degree of artificial illumination (0 h, 12 h at night, and 24 h d-1 in addition to ambient sunlight) used to supplement ambient sunlight and water volume exchange rate (1, 6, or 35 d-1). Rates of dulse production, dulse consumption by abalone, ammonia uptake by dulse and ammonia excretion by abalone were measured seasonally over 1 year. Abalone growth rates under co-culture conditions were measured. Maximum abalone stocking densities within the co-culture system were first limited by the amount of algae available for abalone consumption, and then by the capacity of the algae to absorb ammonia excreted by abalone. Degree of supplemental illumination, water volume exchange rate, and abalone body weight all affected maximum stocking densities within the co-culture system. The growth rates of abalone fed dulse grown under all co-culture conditions (range: 112-132 μm shell length d-1) compared favorably with that of abalone fed on other algal and artificial diets. Both duration of supplemental illumination and water volume exchange rate affected abalone growth. Overall, the co-culture of dulse and abalone provides the farmer with a reliable supply of nutritious abalone food while ensuring high water quality through uptake of excreted ammonia by the dulse.

The etiology of WS is uncertain with limited evidence for the role of a gastrointestinal Rickettsiales-like prokaryote (RLP). We documented for the first time the occurrence of animals with clinical signs of WS and associated morphological changes in another haliotid species, the red abalone H. rufescens. In this study, 60 juvenile red abalone (8 cm) were randomly selected from a farmed population raised at 148C that was known to have low-intensity RLP infections but lacked clinical signs of WS. The abalone were held in triplicate containers receiving water of approximately 14.78C (Control, Co) or 18.58C (elevated temperature, ET) and were fed equally for 220 d. Survival was 100% (30/30) for the Co group and 67% (20/30) for the ET group. The ET group animals had higher RLP infection intensities and showed more clinical signs (mantle retraction, lower weight gain, lower condition index) and morphological changes (digestive gland degeneration) associated with WS. In trials conducted immediately before termination of the experiment, ET group animals fed at half the rate of Co group animals. Among ET group animals, the intensity of RLP infections in the posterior portion of the esophagus was positively correlated with WS clinical signs and morphological changes, whereas no correlations were present among Co group animals. During 1997–1998 and in conjunction with elevated seawater temperatures associated with El Nin˜o, several abalone farms in California experienced a dramatic increase in the proportion of red abalone showing signs of WS. Examination of 66 red abalone from five commercial farms revealed that animals with more advanced RLP infections had more severe WS clinical signs and associated morphological changes. Collectively, these data demonstrate that RLP infection plays a key role in the etiology of WS in red abalone and that warm water enhances the severity of the pathogenic effects of RLP infection. © by the American Fisheries Society 2000.",10.1577/1548-8667(2000)012<0026:WSIFRA>2.0.CO;2,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033876101

Tan B.; Mai K.,"Zinc methionine and zinc sulfate as sources of dietary zinc for juvenile abalone, Haliotis discus hannai Ino",2001,Aquaculture,192,1,67,84,,"A feeding experiment was conducted to determine the minimum dietary zinc requirement of juvenile abalone, Haliotis discus hannai, with zinc methionine (ZnMet) and zinc sulfate (ZnSO4·7H2O) as the zinc sources and to compare the bioavailability of the two zinc sources using a premium quality diet based on casein-gelatin as the protein sources. Semipurified experimental diets containing graded levels of dietary zinc (5.6-84.6 mg zinc/kg) provided as either ZnMet or ZnSO4 were fed to juvenile abalone in triplicate groups for 16 weeks. The results showed that the average weight gain rate (WGR, %), daily increment in shell length (DISL, μm/day), soft-body alkaline phosphatase activity (SBAKP, U/g protein) and soft-body zinc concentration (SB zinc, μg/g) of the abalone were significantly (ANOVA, P < 0.01) affected by dietary treatment, and responded in broken-line models to increases in dietary zinc levels from the two zinc sources. The requirements for dietary zinc using ZnMet and ZnSO4 as the supplemental zinc sources, determined by broken-line regression analysis, on the basis of maximum WGR were 15.49 and 34.10 mg/kg, respectively, on maximum DISL were 15.16 and 33.99 mg/kg, respectively, on maximum SBAKP were 15.54 and 31.91 mg/kg, and on maximum SB zinc deposition were 17.75 and 34.29 mg/kg, respectively. The shell zinc concentration, as well as iron concentration in soft-body and shell of the abalone, however, was maintained relatively constant (ANOVA, P > 0.05) regardless of dietary treatment. Based on these results, a minimum requirement for dietary zinc was recommended to be 16-18 mg/kg from ZnMet, and 35 mg/kg from ZnSO4.

The library was screened with three separate serine proteinase gene fragments amplified from cDNA of H. glycines using consensus oligonucleotide primers. Each predicted protein contains a secretion signal sequence, a propeptide and a mature protein of 226-296 amino acids. One of the predicted enzymes, HGSP-II has 41% identity to a chymotrypsin-like enzyme from the mollusc, Haliotis rufescens, and analysis of key residues involved in substrate binding also suggests a chymotrypsin-like specificity. HGSP-I and HGSP-III show greatest homology to kallikreins but sequence analysis does not allow prediction of their substrate preferences. Southern blot analysis suggests that HGSP-II and HGSP-III are encoded by single-copy genes in contrast to HGSP-I which may have two or more homologues. The regions encoding the mature proteinases were cloned into an expression vector and recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli. Both HGSP-II and HGSP-III were shown, after refolding, to cleave the synthetic peptide N-CBZ-Phe-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin, and this activity could be inhibited by the cowpea trypsin inhibitor, CpTI.

We investigated the potential roles of elevated water temperature, food availability, and parasites (renal coccidia and rickettsiales-like procaryotes or RLPs) in this disease. Results from a temperature-feeding experiment suggested that elevated water temperature was not a direct cause of WS, but accelerated mortality. At a particular water temperature, both fed and starved abalone had similar survival. Abalone with WS fed on kelp until the animal reached the terminal stages of the disease, when visible atrophy of the foot muscle was easily observed. However, fed abalone held at an elevated water temperature, 20°C, had decreased survival relative to those held at 13°C. The lack of food in our investigations did not appear to be a direct cause of WS. In addition, no consistent statistically significant associations were identified between abalone condition and intensity of coccidian infection in both field and laboratory studies. No association was found between condition of the digestive gland and intensity of the RLP infection in our laboratory study. However, all abalone with degenerated digestive glands had visible signs of WS. Time to abalone death did not correlate with intensity of RLP infection, except in a pool of the 13°C treatments and possibly the 13°C starved treatment. Thus, at lower seawater temperatures, the RLP may affect survival. The significance of this observation may have resulted from small sample sizes. Only 22 abalone were included in the 13°C treatment, and 4 of these were in the starved treatment. These data suggest that further investigation of the role of the RLP in WS is needed.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031408603

Absolute and specific growth rates were calculated for both shell length (SL) and whole wet body weight (BW). Dietary Ca supplementation did not significantly affect growth (P > 0.05), however the specific growth rate (BW) of animals fed diets supplemented with P was 7.9% higher than that of animals fed diets without P supplement (P < 0.05). There were no significant Ca x P interactions for growth indices (P > 0.05). Shell thickness was apparently unaffected by dietary Ca level. Mortality due to natural causes was not affected by diet (P > 0.05); the range was 0-7.5% (n = 8 treatments). The average feed conversion ratio (FCR; feed input per unit weight gain of wet abalone) for all diets was 1.19 (r: 0.93-1.4) when uncorrected for uneaten diet, and 0.90 (r: 0.80-0.96) when corrected. The apparent availability of CaCO3 was 65.6%. These results suggest that abalone do not require high levels of Ca in their diet (< 0.5%). Supplementation with CaCO3 is unnecessary, but P supplementation (≤0.7% total P) can improve growth rates. The Ca:P ratio of feed is not important within the range assessed (0.72:1 to 2.68:1).

Patterns and mechanisms observed over 25 years in a large kelp forest suggest that definition of a meaningful benchmark is impossible, because many of the large animals have been gone for years to decades, and kelps are sensitive to large-scale, low-frequency El Nino-Southern Oscillation events and longer term regime shifts. A shift in the oceanographic climate has significantly reduced the average size and carrying capacity of the dominant plant. The animals that have been functionally removed from the community include sea otters, black sea bass, yellowtail, white sea bass, and abalones. Other species are still present, but fisheries have had huge effects on the abundances, size-frequencies, and/or spatial distributions of sheephead, kelp bass, rays, flatfish, rock fish, spiny lobsters, and red sea urchins. Now even sea cucumbers, crabs, and small snails are subject to unregulated fishing. The plants continue to exist without a hint of the effects of the loss of so much animal biomass. Furthermore, most of the megafauna have been removed with very little documentation or historical understanding of what the natural community was like. Thus, our ability to separate anthropogenic impacts from the 'natural' dynamics of the system is severely compromised. We discuss the importance of both an ecosystem focus on productivity and careful monitoring of as many populations as possible. In addition, we show that this community is not tightly integrated with mutual dependencies; hence, many species can be removed without much affecting the rest of the ecosystem.",10.1890/1051-0761(1998)008[0309:SBGARE]2.0.CO;2,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031960256

We measured a mean growth-rate of ca. 30 μm/day, 11 days after larval settlement which stayed constant throughout the experiment. The diatom assemblage on the surface of the alga was studied for 53 days after larval settlement using scanning electron microscopy. Two species of the genus Cocconeis were found to dominate the diatom assemblage on the surface of P. repandum. Up to 18 days after larval settlement, the diatom population increased exponentially. Eighteen days after settlement, post-larval abalone started to graze on the diatom Cocconeis scutellum leaving the bottom valves of the diatoms on the surface of P. repandum. As a result, the diatom population decreased markedly. The outermost cells and polysaccharide layer of P. repandum were often missing but we did not find any grazing marks on the thallus surface up to 53 days post-settlement. We discuss the hypothesis that epithallial cell sloughing of non-geniculate coralline red algae is an intrinsic mechanism to reduce microscopic epiphytes and may interact closely with grazing by post-larval abalone. We concluded that the post-larvae must find an additional food source derived from the NCA before grazing on the diatoms, because of the high growth-rate during the first and second week of rearing and the constancy throughout the experiment.",10.1080/13235818.1997.10673686,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001003407

The production of these gastropods is limited by the short supply of their food, marine seaweed. At the National Center for Mariculture (NCM) in Eilat (Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea), Israel, we have developed a culture system that can produce marine macroalgivores on large quantities of nutritious seaweed cultured in seawater fishpond effluents. Two valuable species of abalone, Haliotis fulgens from California and Haliotis discus hannai from Japan, have been brought to the NCM as new candidates for intensive culture, in addition to the previously introduced Haliotis tuberculata. Despite the differences between Eilat and their natural habitats in climate and in chemical and physical conditions, both species acclimated and reproduced well in Eilat. Survival of the spat of all species fell to less than 5% by 8 weeks. The surviving spats grew in one year to 31, 14 and 28 mm in H. fulgens, H. discus hannai and H. tuberculata, respectively. Middle-sized animals (19-37 mm) of these three species grew daily 0.21%, 0.17% and 0.23%, respectively, with survival of 99%, 96% and 80%, respectively, and an FCR (food conversion ratio, in g fresh feed consumption/ g weight gain) of 14, 22 and 26, respectively. In these growth trials, all size-groups of H. fulgens, like H. tuberculata, grew much faster than reported in the literature. Thus, both of these species seem like good candidates for commercial culture in Israel. On the contrary, H. discus hannai, foras yet unknown reasons, grew slower than in published reports, hence it is not yet ready for commercial culture in Israel.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002360891

A total of 450 samples were examined under 4 different shell lengths, viz. 5, 10, 20, and 30mm. The simulated feed suspensions were either the phytoplankton Pavlova lutheri (average size 3.5 μm) or pulverized pellet powder (average size 3.7 μm), which is used as artificial feed for abalone. The percent catch rate was based on the proportion of particles reduced from the initial number. The particle sizes examined were in the range 2.2 to 45.2 μm. The catch-rates of adult clam (shell length of 30mm) under vigorous filtration indicated nearly constant particle size selection when they were maintained for 60 minutes in the sea water containing 3×105 pellet particles/ml. When the particle concentration increased to 6× 105/ml, however, the catch rates of sizes less than 15 μm decreased to almost a third of the above mentioned concentration. A similar reduction was noted when the exposure was for 180 minutes. Furthermore, the catch rates for particle sizes more than 5 μm increased by almost 20% when pellet was replaced with phytoplankton. When Manila clam of different shell lengths were kept for 60 minutes in the sea water containing 3×105 particles/ml, the catch rates of 5 mm clams for the entire range of particle sizes were almost uniform, showing an average value of 0.68%·h-1. When their shell lengths increased to 10 mm or 20mm, the catch rates for the larger sizes appeared to increase. Thus the larger clams, among the sizes examined, seeks intentionally larger suspended particles to meet their growth requirements.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031391085

This noninvasive technique is ideal for examination of cellular respiratory toxicity since inorganic phosphate, phosphoarginine, and adenosine 5′-triphosphate levels, and the arginine kinase rate constant, can be measured. These parameters were characterized in both red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and owl limpets (Lottia gigantea) during 5-h exposures to 3 mg L-1 (14.5 μM) 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol, followed by 5-h recovery periods. In exposed abalone, phosphoarginine decreased by 50%, inorganic phosphate increased by 900%. and the arginine kinase rate constant quadrupled - all compared to controls and consistent with an uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Limpets were less severely impacted, showing no change in phosphoarginine, an increase of only 200% in inorganic phosphate, and an approximate doubling of the arginine kinase rate constant. Adenosine 5′-triphosphate levels remained constant in all control and exposed molluscs. In addition, at the cessation of dosing, all biochemical parameters in abalone returned to preexposure levels within 3-4 h, consistent with rapid depuration, whereas the limpet recovery data were inconclusive. We suggest that the owl limpet's greater tolerance toward the pesticide could result from an increased capability for anaerobic glycolysis, which is required to survive the periodic anoxia associated with residing higher in the intertidal zone. Thus, the natural histories of nontarget organisms should be considered when the effects of pesticide exposure are determined. © 2001 Academic Press.",10.1006/pest.2001.2554,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034833119
Mai K.; He G.; Xu W.,Studies on postprandial changes of digestive status and free amino acids in the viscera of Haliotis discus hannai ino,1998,Journal of Shellfish Research,17,3,717,722,,"Experiments were conducted to study the postprandial changes of digestive status and free amino acids (FAA) in the viscera of Haliotis discus hannai. A natural pigment in the algal diet, Palmaria palmata, served as an indicator to determine the digestive status of the abalone. The changing concentration of the pigment in the viscera indicates that very active digestion took place during the first 10 h and that the total food passage time was about 44 h for the abalone after a meal at 15°C water temperature. Visceral FAA levels were examined at 0, 4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 36, 44, 52, 62, 72, and 96 h after a meal. The mean level of free essential amino acids (FEAA) attained an obvious peak at 4 h. It increased gradually from 4 to 36 h and then maintained at a relatively constant level till 96 h postfeeding. The mean level of free nonessential amino acids (FNEAA) had a pattern of postprandial change similar to that of FEAA. However, greater variation and fluctuation in concentration were observed among the individual FNEAA than the individual FEAA. A significant correlation was established between essential amino acids in the dietary protein and the FEAA in the abalone viscera that was sampled at 4, 22, 28, 36, 44, 52, 62, and 72 h after feeding. The highest correlation coefficient was obtained at 36 h. Both the algal pigment and the FEAA in the viscera are effective indicators reflecting the digestive status of abalone after a meal.",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032434879
Kawamura T.; Roberts R.D.; Takami H.,A review of the feeding and growth of postlarval abalone,1998,Journal of Shellfish Research,17,3,615,625,,"Survival and growth of abalone postlarvae are greatly influenced by food quality and quantity. Abalone larvae settle on coralline algae, some diatoms films, and conspecific mucous trails. These substrata provide a wide range of potential food sources, which are used in different ways as postlarvae develop. We identify three major transitions in feeding and growth: (1) at metamorphosis, a shift from lecithotrophy/dissolved organic matter (DOM) absorption to particle feeding, with an overlap in nutrition sources; (2) at about 600-800 μm shell length (SL), postlarvae become responsive to the 'digestibility' of diatom diets and grow more rapidly on efficiently digested strains; (3) at around 5-10 mm SL juveniles shift from a biofilm-dominated diet to a macroalgae-dominated diet. We can make some tentative generalizations about growth rates of postlarvae fed ingestible diatoms. Rapid growth (20-30 μm/day) in the first 10 days postsettlement often falls to 10-20 μm/day in the following 1-2 wk, perhaps reflecting the exhaustion of nutrition from yolk/DOM. Postlarvae of 0.8-2 mm SL grow ~ 40-60 μm/day on 'digestible' diatoms and 15-30 μm/day on 'indigestible' ones. Rapidly growing juveniles over 3 mm SL will grow at 100 μm/day or more, whereas poor diets can halve these growth rates. Growth rates of individual abalone will vary widely on both good and poor diets. Diatoms that are emerging as key species for abalone culture include Cylindrotheca closterium (and needle-shaped Nitzschia spp.), Cocconeis spp., and Achnanthes spp., but caution is needed in extrapolating from the limited data available. Hatcheries need to maintain a suitable quantity of ingestible food, as well as consider food quality. Many aspects of postlarval feeding and growth require further research.",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032434878
Roberts R.D.; Nicholson C.M.,"Variable response from abalone larvae (Haliotis iris, H. virginea) to a range of settlement cues",1997,Molluscan Research,18,2,131,141,,"We exposed competent larvae of two abalone species (Haliotis iris and H. virginea) to a range of potential settlement cues, and observed a hierarchy of responses. The end point and the timing of the settlement process varied, depending on the cue provided. Response was qualitatively consistent between experiments, but showed some quantitative variation. Rocks coated with crustose coralline algae (CCA) induced 80-100% of larvae to attach and metamorphose, and 50-100% to grow peristomal shell, within 2 days. A distilled water extract of CCA induced almost 100% attachment within 2 days, but metamorphosis occurred gradually between 2 and 5 days. Shell growth was minimal, apparently inhibited by chemical interference from the extract. γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA, 1 μM) induced 90-100% attachment and 20-60% metamorphosis in H. iris within 2 days. For H. virginea, 1 μM GABA induced attachment (65-100%) but typically only 0-5% metamorphosis within 2 days. KC1 (10 mM) added to seawater induced attachment (50-70%) but less than 10% metamorphosis. Different diatoms induced responses ranging from rapid or gradual induction of metamorphosis, to minimal response. Some combinations of cues produced synergistic effects. E.g., GABA (1 μM) plus diatom biofilm induced more metamorphosis (49%) than biofilm (28%) or GABA (1%) alone. Addition of CCA crude extract to the same biofilm hastened metamorphosis. Observations of attachment without subsequent metamorphosis suggest that there may be separate cues for attachment and metamorphosis. This study highlights the complexity of the settlement response in abalone.",10.1080/13235818.1997.10673687,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000526477

Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the feeding and defecation patterns and functional response of the abalone to varying food density under ambient water conditions. Like other tropical haliotids, H. asinina prefers red algae to brown algal species. Eighteen algal species, 72.2% of which are red algae (Rhodophyta), were observed in the gut contents of all size groups of abalone; Laurencia, Hypnea, Amphiroa and Coelothrix are the most frequent food species. Hypnea and Laurencia are also the most abundant food items of H. asinina. A chi-square test indicated that frequency of occurrence (%) of most algal food species in the gut samples is independent of the size of the animal. About 84% of all algal species were observed in the gut contents of small abalone. Haliotis asinina (mean shell length ± SD = 3.48 ± 0.05 cm) showed a distinct nocturnal feeding periodicity and remained cryptic during daylight hours. Feeding activity was intense from 1800 to 0200 h, but it slowed down a few hours before sunrise, resulting in about 11 h of feeding time within a 24-h cycle. Defecation occurred during the feeding period in proportion to the amount of food consumed and faecal production during the night was significantly higher than during the daylight hours. The total daily faecal output was 1.26 mg dry weight abalone-1. The experiments showed that H. asinina (mean shell length ± SD = 3.55 ± 0.02 cm) consumed more food when food density increased in linear proportion to food abundance.

Subsequent investigations showed the higher energy density of the diets was achieved through the addition of fish oil. Given abalone's low requirement for lipids and the small amount of lipase in their gut, it was hypothesized that high levels of dietary lipid depresses the digestibility of other nutrients, such as amino acids, by restricting the action of digestive enzymes. A series of isonitrogenous diets containing 30, 60, or 90 g/kg of either jack mackerel oil or olive oil were formulated and fed to juvenile Haliotis laevigata to determine the apparent fecal digestibilities of dry matter, gross energy, nitrogen (N), and amino acids. Inclusion of jack mackerel oil in manufactured abalone feeds at levels above 60 g/kg decreased the digestion of dietary N and amino acids, and inclusion at levels above 30 g/kg decreased gross energy digestion. Oil type also influenced the apparent fecal digestibility of N, amino acids, and gross energy. Olive oil inclusion had significantly different effects on the digestion of these parameters when compared with jack mackerel oil; however, these differences were minimal up to inclusion levels of 30 g/kg. It was concluded that the addition of marine or vegetable oils to manufactured abalone diets should be limited to 30 g/kg if the digestibility of N, amino acids, and gross energy is not to be affected and that the addition of oils to increase dietary energy levels in abalone diets may not be a cost-effective strategy and may be detrimental to both energy and protein supply.",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032447038

In addition, the activities of carbonic anhydrase and alkaline phosphatase, two enzymes implicated in calcium metabolism of vertebrates, were quantified. The CGRP circulating concentration increased progressively from the 3- to 7-cm-long abalone, whereas the mantle ir-CGRP strongly decreased in 5-cm-long abalone. Moreover, branchial carbonic anhydrase activity, a specific osteoclastic marker in vertebrates, increased during abalone development from 11.8 to 39 WA Units per mg of gill membrane proteins in 4- and 9-cm-long animals, respectively. Mantle alkaline phosphatase activity, a vertebrate specific osteoblastic marker, showed a twofold increase in 6-cm-long animals (8.11 Units per mg of proteins).

Lipp E.K.; Rose J.B.,The role of seafood in foodborne diseases in the United States of America.,1997,Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics),16,2,620,640,,"In the United States of America, seafood ranked third on the list of products which caused foodborne disease between 1983 and 1992. Outbreaks connected with fish vectors were caused by scombroid, ciguatoxin, bacteria and unknown agents; in shellfish, unknown agents, paralytic shellfish poisoning, Vibrio spp. and other bacteria, followed by hepatitis A virus, were responsible for the outbreaks. At least ten genera of bacterial pathogens have been implicated in seafood-borne diseases. Over the past twenty-five years, bacterial pathogens associated with faecal contamination have represented only 4% of the shellfish-associated outbreaks, while naturally-occurring bacteria accounted for 20% of shellfish-related illnesses and 99% of the deaths. Most of these indigenous bacteria fall into the family Vibrionaceae which includes the genera Vibrio, Aeromonas and Plesiomonas. In general, Vibrio spp. are not associated with faecal contamination and therefore faecal indicators do not correlate with the presence of Vibrio. Viruses are the most significant cause of shellfish-associated disease: in New York State, for example, 33% and 62% of 196 outbreaks between 1981 and 1992 were caused by Norwalk virus and gastrointestinal viruses (small round structured viruses), respectively. In addition, several illnesses are a result of toxic algal blooms, the growth of naturally occurring bacteria and diatoms causing neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning, diarrhoetic shellfish poisoning, amnesic shellfish poisoning and ciguatera. Current estimates place the annual number of ciguatera cases at 20,000 world-wide. Scombroid poisoning is the most significant cause of illness associated with seafood. Scombrotoxin is of bacterial origin and halophilic Vibrio spp. causing high histamine levels are implicated as the source. Scombroid poisoning is geographically diverse and many species have been implicated, namely: tuna, mahi-mahi, bluefish, sardines, mackerel, amberjack and abalone. Temperature abuse has been cited as a major cause of scombroid poisoning. For routine work, the use of faecal indicators to predict the relative level of faecal contamination should not be disposed of. However, the main source of seafood illness is due to species which are not predicted by these organisms. In order to protect public health, routine surveillance using new pathogen-specific techniques such as polymerase chain reaction should be used. This, in combination with risk assessment methods and hazard analysis and critical control points, will begin to address the need for improvement in the safety of seafood.",10.20506/rst.16.2.1048,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031196539

A total of 100 families was produced from a hierarchical mating design using 29 males and 88 females. Larvae from each family were settled and grown in separate tanks until tagged at the age of 10 months, at which time individuals from all families were reared in one common environment, but at two farms, until the age of 24 months. After tagging, the abalone were fed with the macro algae species Palmaria palmata and Laminaria digitata. The mean survival rate of the population was estimated at 9.6% at the age of 4 months, with large variation among families where the highest survival was 31.5% but the lowest 0.02%. The average shell length at the age of 8, 10, 18, and 24 months old was 13.10, 15.88, 34.99, and 50.90 mm, respectively.

A low, but negative, genetic correlation between the survival rate to 4 months and shell length was observed. Genotype by environment interaction was negligible after rearing individuals from the same families in two different farms for 14 months.

In addition to the adverse effect on the abalone aquaculture industry, there is concern that this pest may become established among native stocks. Efforts to exterminate mature and immature stages of the sabellid have focused on the use of water-soluble toxic substances, coating shells with wax or other substances to smother the worms, or altering the osmotic environment without causing irreversible injury to the abalone. These approaches have not provided a dependable method for control of the polychaete. Exposure of sabellid-infested green and pink abalones (Haliotis fulgens and Haliotis corrugata) to temperatures near but below their upper thermal limits has produced the desired results. A 48-h exposure to 28.5°C has effectively killed all life stages of the sabellids but caused only minor mortality among the abalone. An LD50, 48-h upper limit for H. fulgens was confirmed at 31.5°C; that for H. corrugata was established at 30.3°C. Treated abalone placed in optimally circulated seawater and fed the standard food, Egregia menziesii, resumed normal growth and thenceforth displayed no further symptoms of sabellid infestation.

Methods: Patients were recruited as part of a South African seafood allergy survey. Allergic symptoms were assessed by a self-administered questionnaire. A total of 38 patients with abalone sensitivity were recruited. Specific IgE responses to abalone and other mollusks were studied by using RAST and inhibition ELISAs. Skin prick tests and lymphocyte proliferation assays were also performed on several of the subjects. Allergenic components of Haliotis midae were identified with Western blotting. Results: Twenty five of the 38 patients in the study were first seen with immediate symptoms, and 13 had delayed reactions. Seventeen of the sera tested were RAST positive. Skin prick tests responses with abalone extract were positive in all subjects with positive RAST responses (n = 8) and in 6 of 13 subjects with negative RAST responses. Five of the subjects with positive RAST responses had positive results on Western blotting and demonstrated binding to two major allergens with molecular weights of 38 and 49 kd.

Because of this feeding preference, the structure of the digestive tract of H. laevigata was investigated using histological and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The digestive tract of both starved and fed adult H. laevigata revealed the presence of ciliated, mucus, and secretory cells throughout the digestive tract. The esophagus contained secretory, ciliated, and large mucous cells, with fragmentation spherules also present. The crop extended from the esophagus to the stomach. It was surrounded by thin muscularis and consisted mainly of secretory cells, although some phagocytes were present. The stomach possessed mainly secretory cells, although some ciliated cells, mucous cells, and phagocytes were present. The style sac differed from the stomach, having more ciliated cells. In intestinal regions I to III, the epithelium was shorter than in previous regions. Few cilia were present on the ridges, although many were observed in the gutters. Intestinal regions IV to V contained more mucous cells than intestine III, and more bacteria were observed associated with the fecal string than in other regions. The low incidence of bacterial association with the gut epithelium was attributed to the occurrence and number of mucous cells, common throughout the digestive tract.

Chemotactic and phagocytic ability (percent phagocytosis, %P; and phagocytic index, PI), as well as gross morphological characteristics, of hemocytes withdrawn from red (Haliotis rufescens) and black abalone (H. cracherodii) after in vivo exposure to 25, 35, or 45‰ seawater salinity plus 1.2 mg/l PCP were determined. Abalone exposures of 3.5 and 6.5 h, respectively, were based on species-specific metabolic endpoints (MEPs) derived from previous NMR data. Hemocyte chemotaxis was found to be augmented by low salinity in red but not black abalone, while high salinity seemed to reduce chemotactic ability in both species. PCP did not potentiate the effects demonstrated by salinity variations alone in red abalone, although chemotaxis was further compromised in black abalone exposed to high salinity stress combined with PCP. Although chemotactic ability was similar among both species, both %P and PI was greater among black abalone. Low salinity may offset the effects of PCP in red but not black abalone. Whereas red abalone demonstrated a reduction in phagocytic ability upon exposure to high salinity alone, black abalone appeared more resilient to high salinity stress alone. Furthermore, while the effect of high salinity plus PCP is subadditive among red abalone, high salinity seems to potentiate the effect of PCP on black abalone. Finally, hemocytes exposed to acute salinity variations plus PCP showed varying morphological characteristics when compared to controls. Over 30% of hemocytes of high salinity plus PCP exposed abalone remained rounded and generally unattached to glass slides with only a few pseudopod extensions. Hemocyte preparations incubated in rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin were observed with fluorescence microscopy and reveal an altered actin filament pattern. Overall, black abalone demonstrate greater phagocytic ability than red abalone both in the presence and absence of PCP. Furthermore, increases in salinity are accompanied with reduced phagocytic ability with red abalone demonstrating particular sensitivity to salinity variations. While PCP inhibits ATP synthesis, salinity variations may impose an additional stress on intertidal animals exposed to transient or seasonal environmental changes.

The system was the first and simplest trial in a series of progressive complexity of the concept of integrated culture of seaweed, abalone, fish and clams in modular and intensive land-based facilities. Relative sizes of the modules, their stocking densities and the rate of nutrient supply were determined based on earlier results to be optimal. Effluents from two abalone (Haliotis tuberculata) culture tanks drained into macroalgae (Ulva lactuca or Gracilaria conferta) culture and biofilter tanks, where nitrogenous waste products contributed to the nutrition of the algae; net algal production from each algal tank was harvested and used to provide a mixed diet for the abalone. Excess algal yield was used elsewhere. The system was monitored to assess productivity and nitrogen partitioning over a year, while improvements were made based on the accumulating results. Total annual N-budgets were combined with mean production figures to determine a suitable ratio of abalone biomass to algal culture vessel productivity, towards commercial application of the concept. The abalone grew on average 0.26% and 0.25% body weight/d in the two culture tanks; reduced growth and increased food conversion ratios (food eaten/biomass gain; w/w) were associated with high summer water temperatures (max. 26.9°C). U. lactuca showed reliable growth and filtration performance (mean production of 230 g fresh weight/m2/d, removing on average 58% of nitrogen supplied). Conversely, G. conferta growth was highly erratic and was deemed unsuitable for the current application. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Diatom strain affected both survival and growth, which were positively correlated (r = 0.88, p = 0.05, n = 5). The digestibility and ingestibility of diatoms were both important. Survival ranged from low (<10% on day 37 postsettlement) on Pleurosigma sp. diet, to high (>70% on day 68) on Cocconeis scutellum, Cylindrotheca closterium; and Navicula ramosissima diets. Diet had little effect on growth and survival in the first 16 days after settlement, provided postlarvae were ingesting adequate food.

Fifteen isonitrogenous (approximately 30% CP) casein-gelatin-based diets containing five graded levels of phosphorus (0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0%) for each of three levels of calcium (0%, 1.0% and 2.0%) were fed to the animals previously fed a basal diet (0.23% total P and 0.17% total Ca) for 14 days. After 16 weeks of feeding, survival ranged from 94.7% to 100.0% with no significant difference among dietary treatments. The weight gain rate (WGR), daily increment in shell length (DISL), carcass concentrations of lipid and protein, soft-body alkaline phosphatase activity and phosphorus, zinc, manganese contents were significantly affected by dietary phosphorus levels. Supplementation of 1.0% and 2.0% calcium to the basal diet reduced soft-body phosphorus deposition and did not appear to increase the nutritive value of the diet, indicating that a dietary calcium supplement is not required under the present experimental conditions. The dietary phosphorus requirements were evaluated from the pooled WGR and DISL, respectively, by using the second-order polynomial regression analysis. On the basis of the pooled WGR and DISL, the optimum ranges of dietary available phosphorus were 0.65-1.17% (approximately 0.7-1.2% total P), and 0.64-1.14% (approximately 0.7-1.2% total P), respectively. Based on these results, about 1.15% available phosphorus (1.25% of total P) is recommended for the maximum growth of H. discus hannai, and if dietary available phosphorus is reduced from 1.15% to 0.65%, the growth of the abalone may be depressed with 5% likelihood.

The progress of gonadal maturation may be divided into three states: immature (0-500 degree-days), mature (500-1500 degree-days), and fully mature (after 1500 degree-days). This system agrees with qualitative observations of the progress of maturation confirmed by artificial induction of spawning, where EAT 0 is the beginning of conditioning started during the recovery stage of the reproductive cycle of this species in the winter. Temperature appears to be the major external environmental factor which regulates the breeding cycle of this mollusc, because the artificially produced spawning period (after 1500 degree-days) corresponds well with the natural breeding season in terms of EAT. Adequate nutritional levels of over 5% feeding rate (weight wet food ingested/body weight) are necessary for application of this relationship of EAT uniformly to experimental populations. Gravid adults are obtainable throughout the year by temperature control based on EAT. Spawning is induced by a stimulus produced by the UV irradiation of seawater. The release of gametes can be set for any desired time of day by artificial photoperiod (12L-12D) conditioning of the mollusc in advance. © 1984.",10.1016/0044-8486(84)90270-9,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000389855

Shepherd S.A.,Studies on Southern Australian Abalone (Genus Haliotis). i. Ecology of Five Sympatric Species,1973,Marine and Freshwater Research,24,3,217,258,,"Five species of abalone occur along the southern Australian coastline; of these three species, Haliotis laevigata Donovan, Haliotis roei Gray, and Haliotis ruber Leach, are of commercial importance; the other two species are Haliotis cyclobates Peron and Haliotis scalaris Leach. The habitat, movement, feeding behaviour, food, and ecological relationships with predators were studied for each species at three study sites. Each species of abalone occupies a distinctive microhabitat. H. cyclobates lives in calm-water places associated with communities of the seagrass Posidonia australis and the razor shell Pinna dolobrata; H. laevigata lives on open rock adjacent to sand in moderate to rough water localities; H. ruber prefers caves in calm- to rough-water localities; H. roei occurs in narrow crevices in the upper sublittoral on rough-water coasts; H. scalaris is an under-boulder or crevice-living species. All species are sedentary, but may make local movements in search of food. Several species may occur in a given habitat but there is little microhabitat overlap. The seasonal variation in food eaten by each species is described. All species show preference for red algae and reject most species of brown algae, subsisting predominantly on red algae and seagrasses according to the possibilities of the habitat. H. laevigata feeds mainly on algal drift and H. roei is substantially a grazing species. The other species feed on algal drift or graze opportunistically. Water movement is an important environmental factor affecting the feeding of those species which feed on algal drift. H. laevigata and H. ruber feed best in conditions of moderate water movement but poorly if the water is too calm or too rough. Water movement elicits a characteristic feeding response in these species. The predators of abalone include fish, crabs, molluscs, and starfish; their interaction with abalone is discussed. Crevices, caves, and cavities under boulders provide a refuge in space from predators for H. roei, H. ruber, and H. scalaris and juveniles of other species, which appear to be confined to these places, except for nocturnal feeding excursions, by the activity of their predators. The adults of the different species differ from each other in their dependence on water movement, their preference for open or cryptic sites such as crevices or caves for resting, their size and their methods of feeding. These differences between the species, taken together, ensure that there will be very little overlap between them in the sorts of places that they seek to live in or their behaviour in seeking food; in those cases where food-seeking behaviour is similar, interspecific competition would seem to be negligible because food is abundant. Predation would seem to have been more important than interspecific competition as the selective pressure that established and maintains these differences between the species. © 1973 CSIRO.

Morse D.E.,Biotechnology in marine aquaculture,1986,Aquacultural Engineering,5,2-Apr,347,355,,"Intensification of production, modernization of technique, and improvement of cultivars are needed to increase the economic efficiency of marine aquaculture industries. To help achieve such improvements, modern methods of biochemical and genetic engineering can be adapted to control biological processes which intrinsically limit the efficiency and yield of production. Such applications now have been developed for improved production of molluscs. Critical life-cycle stages of several species of abalones and other commercially valuable molluscs which thus far have proved amenable to improved control by these means include reproduction, larval settlement, metamorphosis, and acceleration of early growth. Analysis of the physiological and molecular mechanisms which control reproduction in molluscs reveals a prostaglandin-dependent regulation of spawning in abalones and certain other species. Spawning of gravid adults can be induced by the addition of prostaglandins to the surrounding seawater, or, more reliably and inexpensively, by activation of the endogenous enzymatic synthesis of prostaglandin-related spawning triggers in response to added hydrogen peroxide. Peroxide activation of the prostaglandin-dependent spawning reaction has been found widely useful for obtaining synchronous and copious release of fully competent gametes in a large number of species of abalones, oysters, scallops, mussels, clams, and other valuable molluscs; a number of these species had not been successfully spawned by other methods. Settlement and metamorphosis of many molluscan species can be brought under similar biochemical control. Most efficiently and inexpensively, the natural biochemical requirement for induction of these critical developmental processes can be met by providing competent larvae with unique amino acid constituents associated with the naturally required inducing molecules. Thus, γ-aminoburyric acid (GABA) can be used simply, safely and inexpensively to induce complete and rapid larval settlement and metamorphosis - with minimal mortality - in many commercially important abalone species. This and similar neurotransmitter-related, amino-acid-derived compounds are proving comparably effective for the reliable induction of settlement and metamorphosis in a number of other valuable molluscan species. Recent analyses of the requirements for rapid early juvenile growth in abalones reveals a mechanism of growth-control which is susceptible to exogenous hormonal acceleration. Genetic cloning and amplification of recombinant-DNA templates for the efficient production of essential growth-regulating hormones, and substances required for enhanced nutritional efficiency and resistance of cultivars, are now in progress. Genetic engineering for the direct improvement of cultivated species soon will be within reach. © 1986.",10.1016/0144-8609(86)90027-0,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022194738

Heart-rate responses, as a physiological indicator, against water-temperature changes were compared between animals with differential genetic make-ups in thermostability of enzyme to examine the above results suggested from observing wild populations by using a total of 98 specimens of the pacific abalone, sampled from waters of Sanriku, Iwate and Rebun Islands, Hokkaido. After being acclimated to a rearing tank with water temperature regulating system, each animal was subjected to a constant rate of change of water temperatures for recording heart-rate responses until being sacrificed. Heart-rate was recorded as frequency of changes of impedance between two electrodes inserted immediately dorsal to the heart through fine holes in the shell. Temperatures, at which maximum heart-rate (or one half of the maximum) appeared, varied from one animal to another, as demonstrated by distributions of selected parameter (s) of heart-rate curve.

Addition of P resulted in little change in either biomass or protein, however, lipid levels were lower. Mean growth rate of abalone (measured as shell length) in N enhanced treatments was 2 times that of control or P.

Effects of algal diets on growth and biochemical composition",1993,Invertebrate Reproduction and Development,23,2-Mar,75,88,,"This study was conducted to examine the nutritional value of eight algal diets for two species of abalone, Haliotis tuberculata and Haliotis discus hannai, by measuring biochemical composition of the algae and relating this to feeding rate, growth and biochemical composition of the animals. Nutritional value of algal diets can be divided into three categories for each species of abalone. For H. tuberculata the best performance was on the mixed diet and Palmaria palmata intermediate was Alaria esculenta, Ulva lactuca and Laminaria digitata, and lowest growth was on Laminaria saccharina and Chondrus crispus. For H. discus hannai, best performance was on A. esculenta, P. palmata and the mixed diet; intermediate was on L. saccharina and L. digitata and lowest was on U. lactuca. It is generally accepted that high “balanced” levels of protein (> 15%), lipid (3-5%) and carbohydrate (20-30%), with no detrimental substances in natural algae are essential for optimal growth performance of these abalone. The fact that A. esculenta, L. saccharina and U. lactuca had different dietary values for the two abalone species indicates specific nutritive requirements and/or digestive physiology. Overall, H. tuberculata grew faster, had higher food conversion efficiencies and muscle yield than H. discus hannai. Generally abalone fed on the highest category diets, had higher muscle yields and levels of protein, visceral lipids and muscle carbohydrate. Viscera and foot muscle are reservoirs for lipid and carbohydrate, respectively. The effect of algal diet on sexual maturation is similar to that on somatic growth. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",10.1080/07924259.1993.9672298,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0004980096

Mutuality Among the Colored Shell Area, Growth of the Abalone and Algal Vegetation",1962,NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI,28,8,780,783,,"In the abalone, Haliotis discus hanntai Ino, growing ground Onagawa Bay, Miyagi Prefecture, a proportion of the bluish-green area to the whole shell surface may be assumed as an index to the relative growth of the univalve. In this respect the author (1962) experimentally proved that the abalones fed with brown algae grow faster than those given green or red algae, and their shell bears bluish-green color. He (1958) also reported that correlation exists between annual harvests of the abalones and their favorite food, Undaria pinnatifida, a brown seaweed. The present work was undertaken to evaluate various localities around the Bay for propagation of the abalone by observing the ratio of the bluish-green area to the whole shell surface of the sample specimens and algal vegetation in these areas (Table 1 and Fig. 1). The survey indicated that 1) the annual harvest of U. pinnatifida per kilometer of the coast line was different from place to place (Fig. 1); 2) where the brown alga was more abundant, the abalone grew faster with the bluish-green shell area being larger, than in specimens from the other localities (Fig. 2); 3) even among the specimens from the same seaweed ground, those which had a higher ratio of the bluish-green area grew faster than the others (Fig. 3). These findings suggest that in a locality where U. pinnatifida is flourish, the abalone ottener eats this seaweed, grows faster, and comes to bear the bluish-green shell area at a higher ratio. In other words, the shell complexion of the abalone from a locality may reveal, to some extent, whether or not the locality is suitable for propagation of the univalve. © 1962, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

Nor did all the southern temperate species form a single cluster. In addition, genetic characters do not support previous sub-generic divisions within Haliotis. The observed genetic distances between some species were found to be large, and in some cases larger, than those normally associated with species in the same genus. These relationships provide insight into the evolutionary history and biogcography of the group and emphasize the need for taxonomic review based on both morphological and genetic information. © 1993 The Malacological Society of London.",10.1093/mollus/59.4.429,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027140848

In the present studies, the digestibilities of several proteins and carbohydrates in Japanese top shell, Turbo cornutus, a seaweed feeder, have been determined by the chromic oxide indicator method.3) The composition of the synthetic diets used was shown in Table 1. The method of preparing diets was the same that applied in Haliotis (this bull., 29, 691 (1963)), namely, sodium alginate in the diets was converted to insoluble calcium alginate by dipping in CaCl2 solution and the nutrients were kept in it. The shells were provided with the film-shaped diets thus prepared. The chemical composition of the diets showed little change in sea water for several hours (Table 2). As shown in Table 3, casein was found to be the highest in digestibility among proteins tested, and followed by soybean meal- and dried brown alga-proteins. The digestibilities of fish meal-proteins were low, especially in brown fish meal. The polysaccharides such as dextrin and alginic acid were considerably high in digestibility regardless the composition of the diet and laminarin showed also high value, whereas that of raw starch was low.

A similar study was made of faecal matter obtained from captive animals that were fed on solo diets of common drift algae. Results indicated a number of brown, red and green macroalgae could pass through the digestive tract of both species with some degree of cellular integrity and pigmentation (although not necessarily alive). Despite this variety, none of the fragments collected from the faecal matter of wild taken abalone grew in culture. A large number of fine filamentous and microalgae, presumably derived from the epiphytic communities on the macroalgae consumed by the abalone, were found to grow in culture having survived digestion. Cultures from faecal matter of abalone fed on solo diets showed two species, Caulerpa brownii (C. Agardh) Endlicher and Ulva australis Areschoug, were capable of surviving digestion; both algae are less preferred by abalone than other food species. Highly preferred algae are digested too efficiently to survive and the less preferred algae are either not consumed or otherwise eaten in such small quantities that survival cannot be determined. © 1995 by Walter de Gruyter.",10.1515/botm.1995.38.1-6.53,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029170528

This transition is accompanied by a switch in genetic expression of the template proteins, suggesting that the premetamorphic protein may serve as a template for aragonite nucleation and growth, while template proteins synthesized after metamorphosis may direct crystallization of calcite. These analyses are based on improvements we recently reported for the detection and purification of proteins from the demineralized shell matrix. Genetic cloning experiments now in progress are aimed at discovering additional protein sequences responsible for the programmed control of crystal phase termination, since it is the termination and reinitiation of mineralization that is responsible for the regularity of highly ordered microlaminates produced in nature.",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027187938

Fractions of <1000, 1000-10,000 and >10,000 daltons were isolated by ultrafiltrations and gel chromatography from a seawater extract of abalone muscle. The two lower-molecular-weight fractions (<1000, 1000-10,000) were the least stimulatory of the three fractions tested, and both were ineffective as feeding stimulants. Solutions combining any two of the three isolated fractions produced behavioral activity equal to that caused by whole extract; thus, no single fraction was essential to the stimulatory capacity of abalone. The >1000-dalton fraction was also highly stimulatory, meaning that large and not small molecules were essential in initiating feeding. Finally, a 75% ethanol-insoluble component of the <10,000 fraction was effective, while the ethanol-soluble portion was not. Since the insoluble material consisted predominantly of peptides and polypeptides, it is probable that these molecules act as principal stimulants in abalone muscle. © 1984 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",10.1007/BF00987976,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001061309

Injected into the circulation of intact, unrestrained animals, the peptide initially enhanced the rate of beating, augmented the aortic diastolic and pulse pressures, and raised the arteriovenous (AV) pressure difference; but at higher doses, this initial enhancement was followed by a decrease in aortic blood pressure, an increase in efferent ctenidial pressure, and a substantially reduced heart rate. Therefore, FMRFamide could have a role in controlling the circulation of H. Kamtschatkana.

Juvenile abalone Haliotis discus hannai ino weighing 3.1—4.3 g in live weight (29-34 mm in shell length) were fed on one of the variety of the formulated test diets containing casein or white fishmeal as a protein source, and different levels of sodium alginate, lipid and a mineral mixture, for 30 and 40 days, respectively. The growth rate and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) were compared with those obtained by feeding with live fronds of the alga Eisenia bicyclis as a control, which was known to have high dietary value for this herbivore. Dietary value of the casein diet was found to be comparable or superior to that of the alga. While feeding abalone on a white fishmeal diets resulted in a lower growth and FCE, being about 60% of those compared to the casein diets.

The ecological implications for the Point Loma kelp forest community were studied by comparing long term data with conditions during and after the spill. Surface ammonium concentrations within 1 km of the break were at potentially toxic levels, and light levels were reduced enough to have inhibited kelp germination and growth. However, because of El Niño conditions, it is unlikely that kelp would have germinated in the absence of a spill. Beyond 1 km, high ammonium concentrations benefitted the nutrient-depleted surface canopy of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera). Measured sedimentation rates were significantly higher near the outfall during the spill and were strongly related to wave height; water motion, however, prevented sediment accumulation. Bioassays were conducted on a grid of stations surrounding the outfall. There were significant reductions in the density and growth of microscopic sporophytes of Macrocystis outplanted near the outfall during the spill, but this pattern disappeared in samples collected 11 d after the repair was completed and was not observed again. Sediments collected near the outfall during the spill significantly reduced Macrocystis germ tube elongation; a post repair assay showed no differences with respect to the outfall. No significant effects were observed in outplants of juvenile Macrocystis sporophytes, cup corals, and juvenile abalones. Video transects during the spill and subsequent diving observations provided no evidence of sediment accumulation or negative impacts on established animal populations. Kelp population dynamics at the permanent sites were predictable from existing population structure and El Niño conditions. Damage to kelps, apparently resulting from a combination of low light and nutrient conditions with mechanical damage from storms, construction activity, and barge anchor cables, was observed along the outfall immediately adjacent to the break point. Shortly after the outfall was repaired, upwelling improved conditions for kelp germination and growth, and the zone of maximum impact developed into a dense kelp forest. Suspension feeders, detritivores and sea urchins, whose natural history indicates they could have been affected by the spill, showed no unusual population changes. In the context of the continuum of disturbances observed in two decades of population studies at Point Loma, the spill was a modest disturbance similar to the natural vagaries of kelp recruitment. We emphasize that this spill was an intense but not chronic impact during an El Niño event that also stressed control areas. However, it is representative of massive spills in coastal regions, and the fact that a sewage spill of this magnitude had no lasting effects on a kelp forest community is of general interest. © 1995.",10.1016/0141-1136(94)00008-D,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028991146

The other two species, C. fusiformis and L. annulata contained only 16% protein but had nearly twice the total carbohydrate (11 to 12%) and two to three times the ash (29 to 35%) of the other species. All species contained a similar percentage of lipid (18 to 20%), and a high protein quality based on their total amino acid composition. The usefulness of these diatoms for mariculture will be determined by growth rates, gross composition and acceptability to the animal. N. closterium had the fastest growth rates of the benthic mat-forming diatoms, it was rich in protein, and it may be a good candidate for abalone culture. The two Skeletonema spp. had the fastest growth rates of the chain-forming diatoms, and are already widely used for prawn larval culture in Australia. Feeding trials are now necessary to confirm the high nutritional value of these diatom species for specific animals. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",10.1007/BF00003938,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029201032

We examined the effect of the timing of metamorphosis on the development of the central nervous system (CNS), concentrating on the pattern of serotonin and small cardioactive peptide‐ (SCP) immunopositive neurons in the cerebral ganglia. By 4 days postfertilization the cerebral ganglion has five pairs of serotonin‐immunoreactive (IR) neurons, one pair of which (the V cells) innervate the velum. This complement of cells remains stable for as long as the larval stage persists but metamorphosis causes the rapid loss of the V cells. In the case of SCP‐IR neurons, one pair is present prior to metamorphic competency, but as larvae continue to age in the absence of inducing cues, additional pairs are gradually added. Metamorphosis causes an acceleration in SCP‐IR neuron addition. This separation of developmental patterns is well adapted for the inherent uncertainty of the timing of metamorphosis in abalone larvae. © 1992 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The present work examines associations between thermostability variations of enzymes at multiple loci and temperature tolerance in terms of survival of animals against high and/or low temperature stresses within each group of diploid and triploid animals, induced artificially, and compared such temperature tolerances between normal diploid (2n) and two kinds of triploid sib animals of the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai. Significantly higher survivals of animals homozygous of thermo-resistant allele at phosphoglucomutase and malate dehydrogenase thermostability loci against high water temperature stress as well as of those homozygous of thermo-sensitive allele at malate dehydrogenase thermostability locus against low water temperature stress were observed. Comparison of high temperature tolerances between different ploidy sib animals indicated the greatest survival in the animals of 3n.lpb group, followed by 2n and the least survival in 3n.2pb group. In addition, a combined effect of chromosome-set manipulation and selected genotype of thermostability variations was seen, suggesting a possible immediate application of the results of such observations towards greater productivity in abalone aquaculture through an appropriate selective breeding programme. © 1987, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

In the abalone receiving the casein diets, feed conversion efficiency (FCE) and protein retention were found to be proportional to the dietary protein levels and reached plateau at a 38% protein level where the values for PER and NPU were 2.4 and 48, respectively. The maximum rate of protein retention was obtained at a 10% protein level in the casein diet and at a 22% protein level in the white fishmeal diet. In addition, growth, FCE and protein retention in the abalone fed on the white fishmeal diets were all far inferior to those obtained by the casein diets. The values for PER and NPU obtained with the white fishmeal diets were about one half of those obtained with the casein diets. The difference in nutritional quality between both of these protein sources was postulated to be due to low digestibility of white fishmeal protein in the abalone. When casein is used as a protein source, an optimum protein level in the practical diets for juvenile abalone is estimated to be around 20-30% based on the growth rate, FCE, protein retention and NPU. © 1986, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

About 63% of the energy content of the food consumed (C) is lost as faeces (F) and a further 32% expended on respiration (R). Energy losses in the form of ammonia excretion are negligible, accounting for less than 1% of consumption. Some 5% of energy intake, or 13% of absorbed ration (Ab) is thus available for growth and reproductive output (Pg & Pr). In juveniles (<100mm) this is all allocated towards somatic growth, while in adults an increasing proportion of production is expended on reproductive output. Although feeding, respiration and excretion rates all increase with temperature the proportions of energy allocated to the various components of the energy budget appear to be consistent. Population energy budgets are calculated from density and size distribution surveys at two study sites. At Marcus Island, on the Cape west coast, the population has a standing stock of 82 g (wet flesh weight) m-2,.consumes about 3260 KJm-2y-1 algae and has a P/B ratio of 0.46, whereas at Cape Hangklip, on the Cape south coast, the population biomass is_133gm-2, consumes 8613KJm-2y-1 and has a P/B ratio of 0.70.

The blacklip abalone Haliotis rubra was rarely eaten on most reefs, but aggregations of the starfish were found feeding on abalone at some times and places where other suitable prey were scarce. Where abalone were eaten, a higher proportion of small abalone were eaten than larger ones. Starfish preferred small abalone to mussels of the same weight in laboratory choice experiments, and the time required for the starfish to eat mussels and abalone of the same size were similar. Previously unobserved aspects of the escape response of abalone may explain the variable rate of predation on abalone by C. calamaria. Abalone displayed various behavioural responses to attack that increase the likelihood of escaping. One response apparently involves the production of a chemical deterrent in the abalone epithelium. It appears that as a result abalone are not often eaten unless mussels stocks are depleted and the starfish are at high densities. This is most likely on offshore reefs where abundant mussel recruitment in most years sustains large numbers of C. calamaria. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group.

The role of polyunsaturated fatty acids of macroalgae in abalone nutrition",1996,Aquaculture,139,1-Feb,77,89,,"This study was undertaken to evaluate the nutritional role of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in dietary macroalgae for the abalone, Haliotis tuberculata and Haliotis discus hannai. The effects of five species of macroalgae (Alaria esculenta, Laminaria digitata, Laminaria saccharina, Palmaria palmata and Ulva lactuca) on specific growth rates (SGR) of the abalone and, the relationship between abalone SGR and fatty acid profiles in the algae were investigated. The current study confirmed our previous findings. Based on SGR the dietary values of these macroalgae can be listed in a decreasing order as follows: P. palmata, A. esculenta, U. lactuca, L. digitata and L. saccharina for H. tuberculata and, A. esculenta, P. palmata, L. digitata, L. saccharina and U. lactuca for H. discus hannai. Fatty acid analysis revealed that C18 and C20 PUFA, such as 18:4n-3, 18:3n-3, 20:4n-6 and 20:5n-3, were dominant in the brown algae, A. esculenta, L. digitata and L. saccharina. The red alga, P. palmata, was characterised by the highest proportion of 20:5n-3 among the selected algae. In the green alga, U. lactuca, however, the dominant PUFA were C16 and C18 fatty acids, while C20 fatty acids were minimal. All the selected algae consistently contained very low levels of C22 fatty acids. Statistical analyses demonstrated that (a) 20:5n-3 played a prominent role in the nutrition of both abalone species; (b) 18:3n-3 as well as other n-3 PUFA, and 18:2n-6 together with other n-3,6 long-chained PUFA also contributed to the faster growth of H. tuberculata and H. discus hannai, respectively. The results suggest that the PUFA of both n-3 and n-6 families seem to be essential for growth of H. discus hannai; for H. tuberculata, however, growth enhancement appeared to depend largely on n-3 PUFA. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

(Gastropoda: Haliotidae) were assessed in the hatchery. Animals were held in cages deployed in a flowtray with recirculating seawater maintained at 18 ± 2 °C, and fed ad libitum on the red alga Palmaria palmata (L.) Kuntze. In the grading experiment juvenile abalone were divided into four populations consisting of small (mean ± s.e; initial shell length = 15.3 ± 0.15 mm; n = 35), medium (initial shell length = 19.6 ± 0.16 mm; n = 35), large (initial shell length = 23.8 ± 0.17 mm; n = 35) and an ungraded control group (16.8 ± 0.41 mm; n = 35). Rearing was carried out over a period of 226 days, after which it could be concluded that an advantage in overall growth performance had been gained by grading the animals. There was evidence that growth of small abalone improved in the absence of larger conspecifics. In the stocking density experiment with two size grades and three stocking densities, a decreasing exponential relationship was found between growth (body weight and shell length) and stocking density, with a substantial amount of growth occurring at all densities. Final total biomass for both grades of abalone increased with density. For the smaller grade biomass gain increased as density increased. However, for the larger grade biomass gain declined at higher density. Overall mean survival (± s.e) was 98.3 ± 0.4% and was not influenced by density. It is suggested that the choice of stocking density is essentially a trade-off between maximum growth, optimal biomass gain, and economic considerations which may dictate densities that would result in a net reduction in overall production costs. © 1995.",10.1016/0044-8486(95)00066-6,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029538642
Uki N.; Watanabe T.,Effect of Heat-treatment of Dietary Protein Sources on Their Protein Quality for Abalone,1986,NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI,52,7,1199,1204,,"Effect of heat-treatment of dietary proteins on their nutritional quality for the abalone Haliotis discus hannai was investigated to clarify the reason for low dietary value of white fishmeal as a protein source in abalone diet. Casein and fishmeal prepared from pollock were exposed to various heat-treatments (80-130° C, 2 h) and their nutritional quality as protein sources was compared with those without treatment or fresh fish meat by feeding abalone of different growth stages (13–56 mm in shell length) with diets containing each of those protein sources. The nutritional quality of dietary protein sources was found to be greatly affected by heat-treatment. The growth of abalone and feed conversion efficiency were remarkably reduced by feeding diets containing heat-treated casein or fishmeal. The influence of heat-treatment on the dietary value of protein sources was more marked in larger size of abalone. Thus it may be concluded that the inferior protein quality of white fishmeal to casein in abalone is due to the effect of heat during the manufacturing process of white fishmeal. © 1986, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

This parasite showed high resistance to six other potential disinfectants: formalin, iodophor, isopropanol, methylene blue, malachite green, and copper sulfate. The antibiotic fungicide cycloheximide at 1-2 mg per l for 23 h per day on 5 consecutive days proved efficacious. However, this treatment had three disadvantages: (1) it was detrimental to some diatoms upon which the abalone fed, (2) it was ineffective against non-growing but infective zoospores of L. haliotidis and thus reinfection usually occurred within 2-3 weeks following treatment, and (3) it resulted in cycloheximide resistant forms of L. haliotidis. Two different combinations of three sulfonamides (sodium sulfamethazine and sodium sulfathiazole with either sodium sulfapyridine or sodium sulfacetamide), especially in conjunction with neomycin sulfate, partially retarded the progression of the disease. Nine other therapeutic agents (betanaphthol, acriflavin hydrochloride, rivanol, furanace, oxytetracycline, chloramine-B, oxolinic acid, metronidazole, and neomycin sulfate) showed little or no activity against L. haliotidis at concentrations higher than would be feasible for use in an abalone culture facility. © 1989.",10.1016/0044-8486(89)90098-7,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024940532

Digestion efficiencies of abalone fed on the nine diatom species were also measured. All abalone showed active feeding behaviour and diatom cells were observed in their stomachs. However, the growth rates of abalone fed on four diatom species, which were readily digested, were higher than those of abalone fed on the other five species of diatom. The cell walls of the former four diatom species were easily broken open when they were grazed by abalone because of their high adhesive strength (three species), or due to the weakly silicified cell walls (one species with a low adhesive strength). The other five species, whose adhesive strengths are low, were easily ingested by abalone without any deformation of the cell walls and the majority of them were excreted whole and still alive. It is considered that post-larval abalone cannot digest diatom cell contents in their alimentary canal without first rupturing the cell wall with the radula. It is thought that the post-larvae which ingested the latter five diatom species could not readily absorb the diatom cell contents as the cell wall was intact and thus their growth rates were low. © 1995.",10.1016/0022-0981(95)00099-2,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028995895

The amino acid compositions of 6 species of macroalgae (Ulva lactuca, Chondrus crispus, Palmaria palmata, Alaria esculenta, Laminaria digitata and Laminaria saccharina) and of the whole soft body of these abalone were determined and compared. The effects of these algal diets on the free amino acid (FAA) profiles in the viscera and muscle of animals were investigated. To find a suitable index to evaluate the protein quality of natural diets for algivores, several indices were computed and correlated to the growth performance of abalone using correlation analysis. These two species of abalone have a very similar amino acid composition, indicating that they may have similar amino acid requirements. In all the selected algae, arginine may be the limiting amino acid, and in some instances methionine, threonine or histidine may be also limiting. Judging from the results of feeding test and amino acid analysis, P. palmata and A. esculenta seem to have the better amino acid pattern and availability among the selected algae. On the other hand, U. lactuca and C. crispus appear to be poor in their amino acid availability and/or pattern. Dietary treatments significantly affected the FAA profiles in animal tissues. The essential amino acid index (EAAI) and the degree of similarity (DS) of EAA patterns may not be applicable to evaluating the nutritional value of protein in natural feeds for the algivorous molluscs. Among the indices examined, the newly proposed index-balance and adequacy of free EAA in viscera (BAEAAv)-seems to be suitable for estimation of protein quality of natural feeds for abalone, because it takes into account the balance, adequacy and availability of EAA in natural diets. © 1994.",10.1016/0044-8486(94)90107-4,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028249985
Spaulding D.C.; Morse D.E.,Purification and characterization of sulfatases from Haliotis rufescens: evidence for changes in synthesis and heterogeneity during development,1991,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,161,5,498,515,,"The digestive glands of many marine molluscs are rich sources of arylsufatase enzymes which may function in the catabolism of sulfated polysaccharides in the diets of herbivorous species. Arylsulfatases, partially purified from the hepatopancreas of the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, were investigated with respect to heterogeneity, catalytic requirements, and timing of induction during development. Four hepatopancreatic enzymes were purified from adult animals using a combination of hydrophobic interaction and anion-exchange chromatography. Zymograms of the four partially-purified enzymes produced by electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions revealed a fifth, relatively more basic isozyme. All four partially-purified enzymes appear to be monomeric, with molecular weights of approximately 43 000 Da each, as measured by gel filtration. The affinities for p-nitrocatechol sulfate, pH optima, and strengths of inhibition by anions displayed by these enzymes are similar to the values reported for other molluscan arylsulfatases. Three of the four enzymes have Km values between 0.8 and 2.0 m M for p-nitrocatechol sulfate; the remaining enzyme (A2) has a Km of 6.7 m M. All four enzymes have pH and temperature optima of 5.5 and 45°C, respectively. Three of the four enzymes have-t1/2(50°C) values of 3.5 min; the enzyme A4 has a t1/2 has a t1/2(50°C) of 8.5 min. A monoclonal antibody directed against form A1b does not cross react with any of the other hepatopancreatic arylsulfatases when assayed by Western blot, confirming the structural heterogeneity of the adult enzymes. Total arylsulfatase activity increases in a biphasic manner during early abalone development, with the first increase occurring early in larval maturation. The secoad phase of enzyme expression is dependent upon the induction of settlement and metamorphosis of the competent veliger larvae, strongly suggesting that the expression of arylsulfatase synthesis (and the maturation of the digestive gland, the hepatopancreas) is controlled by genetic events which occur as a result of metamorphosis. Competent veliger larvae express only two arylsulfatase forms, which share many physicochemical and kinetic characteristics with the adult hepatopancreatic enzymes. However, neither of the larval arylsulfatases is recognized by the monoclonal antibody to form A1b from adult hepatopancreas. Endogenous enzyme inhibitor levels in larvae remain constant throughout the period of arylsulfatase induction, and therefore do not contribute to the control of arylsulfatase activity levels during development. These results are the first documentation of the developmental induction of a specific protein(s) in abalone as a result of metamorphosis. The significance of the timing of arylsulfatase expression is discussed in relation to potential physiological substrates and the dietary switching which occurs at metamorphosis. Possible genetic events which are consistent with the observed patterns of expression of these enzymes also are considered. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/BF00257905,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026293832

The weight gain, protein gain, soft body to shell ratio, and carcass levels of protein and lipid of both abalone species were significantly (ANOVA, P < 0.05) affected by the dietary protein level. The protein requirements of these abalone were evaluated from weight gain and protein gain respectively, by using the second-order polynomial regression analysis. On the basis of weight gain, the optimum protein levels were estimated to be 22.3-32.3%, and 23.3-35.6% for H. tuberculata and H. discus hannai, respectively. According to the protein gain, the statistical analysis indicated that the optimum ranges of protein requirements were 24.0-34.5% and 25.2-36.6% for H. tuberculata and H. discus hannai, respectively. Based on these results, about 35% dietary protein from good quality sources is recommended for the maximum growth of both abalone species; and, if dietary protein is reduced from 35 to 25%, the growth of these abalone may be depressed with 5% likelihood. © 1995.",10.1016/0044-8486(95)01041-6,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029201020

The macroalgae Gigartina radula, Plocamium mertensii, Ecklonia radiata, Phyllospora comosa, Jenerettia lobata, Ulva lactuca and Macrocystis augustofolia showed interspecific variation in ash, nitrogen and energy content; toughness (resistance to penetration); and rates of assimilation and food conversion efficiency by H. rubra. Tests with an artificial diet (agar) showed that feeding rates by H. rubra were influenced by toughness. Toughness also accounted for much of the variation (60%) in the feeding rate on the macroalgal diets. The results of our study show little evidence for chemical deterrence of herbivory for H. rubra, but suggest that food toughness is a primary factor in the feeding preferences of abalone. © 1994.",10.1016/0022-0981(94)90195-3,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028163251

Shell length and abalone biomass were measured over a period of 8 weeks and the relative growth of abalone compared between diets. Abalone were kept at a constant temperature of 15±1°C. Growth on a mixed diet comprising G. chilensis, M. pyrifera and U. lactuca, and a monospecific diet of G. chilensis was greater than that obtainable from diets of M. pyrifera and U. lactuca. Relative growth of abalone feeding on a mixed diet and G. chilensis were 1%/day, while abalone fed on M. pyrifera and U. lactuca had relative growth rates of 0.6 and 0.1%/day respectively. Short-term variation in dietary protein had no significant effect upon growth rates, but G. chilensis had a significantly higher average protein content than other diet algae.

Mizukami Y.; Okauchi M.; Kito H.,Effects of cell wall-lytic enzymes on the electrofusion efficiency of protoplasts from Porphyra yezoensis,1992,Aquaculture,108,3-Apr,193,205,,"The electrofusion efficiency of protoplasts of the marine alga Porphyra yezoensis U. was investigated for the effects of cell wall-lytic enzymes. Fusion products between wild (brown color) and mutant (green color) type protoplasts and between pairs of protoplasts of wild type were visually identified and used to determine the fusion efficiency. Cell wall digestions were carried out in solutions consisting of two kinds of enzymes. One was derived from the marine bacterium Pseudomonas sp. and the other was from one of the following sources: abalones Natohaliotis discus (AAP), top shells Turbo cornutus (TSAP), sea hares Aplysia kurodai (SHAP) or sea urchins Anthocidaris crassispine (SUAP). Both AAP and TSAP, either one combined with bacterial crude enzymes, showed approximately similar effects on the protoplast fusion. Under these enzyme treatments, a maximum of 15 to 20% of the isolated protoplasts formed hybrids after exposure to electric pulses. However, their fusion activities were quite unstable and the fusion rates declined immediately. Thus, fusion rates were only a few percent even when protoplast isolation reached maximum. In the case of the combined SUAP and bacterial enzymes, optimal fusion rate of protoplasts also was observed at approximately 20% but protoplasts could form hybrids with relatively high rates (more than 10%) for at least 2 h during enzyme treatment. Conversely, little or no fusion product was obtained from the protoplasts prepared with the combined SHAP and bacterial enzyme or with the combination of partially purified enzyme from abalone and bacterial, although protoplast production was effective in these solutions. Consequently, the combination of SUAP and bacterial crude enzyme was the most efficient enzyme system for protoplast electrofusion among all the systems examined. In addition, study of the survival rates of the algal protoplasts suggested that the electrofusion efficiency would be largely influenced by the viability of protoplasts during treatment with the wall-lytic enzymes. © 1992.",10.1016/0044-8486(92)90106-U,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249008379

Following acclimation to clean seawater, three abalones were separately exposed to a 6-h sublethal concentration of PCP (1.2 mg 1-1) until the spectral resonance for inorganic monophosphate (Pi) was half-height to that of phosphoarginine (PA); the endpoint assured that all individuals were metabolically equivalent at the start of air exposure. They were exposed to clean seawater for 2 h to allow the effects from PCP to stabilize, then air for 45 min, and finally clean seawater for 15 h to check recovery. The effects of PCP in foot muscle included a decrease in the concentrations of PA and adenosine triphosphate ([PA] and [ATP], respectively), an increase in Pi, and a decrease in intracellular pH (pHi). Upon air exposure, [PA] and pHi rapidly declined further, [Pi] increased, and [ATP] did not change; the magnitudes were similar to those from emergence alone. After resubmergence, both [PA] and [Pi] recovered rapidly from the effects of hypoxia, but slowly from those of PCP. While pHi initially declined further, both [ATP] and pHi recovered to near-initial levels after 15 h. In general, the metabolic effects of hypoxia did not change upon pretreatment with PCP; the biochemical interaction of the two factors was additive. Another three abalones were separately exposed to PCP at an environmentally relevant concentration of 120 μg 1-1 for 6 h, air for 1 h, then the same PCP concentration for 2.5 h to check recovery. At the lower concentration, PCP produced no discernable effects, and those of hypoxia were similar to those without PCP. Since PCP produced no additional effects with or without hypoxia, it does not significantly impact red abalones at currently measured environmental concentrations. Use of in vivo NMR allows measurement of the interactive effects of multiple stress factors in live aquatic organisms, allowing assessment of the actual environmental effects of pollutants in the laboratory. © 1991.",10.1016/0166-445X(91)90078-N,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026346868

The present studies were undertaken to ascertain whether the abalone enzyme has associated guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins. Membrane fractions were incubated with either islet-activating protein (IAP) or cholera toxin and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the presence of toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylated proteins. The supernatant from a Lubrol PX-extracted 48,000 x g pellet fraction contained a M(r) = 41,000 IAP substrate. This substrate could not be ADP-ribosylated prior to detergent extraction. Lubrol PX-solubilized fractions of membrane preparations from mouse, bovine, and human sperm also contained a M(r) = 41,000 IAP substrate. These proteins co-migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with the M(r) = 41,000 α(i)-subunit of the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G(i)) from transformed chicken embryo fibroblast and mouse S-49 lymphoma membrane extracts. The sperm IAP substrates displayed similar protease digest patterns to α(i) of mouse S-49 lymphoma cells. Sea urchin sperm analyzed in a similar manner contained a M(r) = 39,000 IAP substrate. Cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of specific sperm membrane proteins was not observed in any of the sperm preparations tested. The presence of the β-subunit common to both the stimulatory and inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory heterotrimers was confirmed in sperm using an antiserum directed against the purified β-subunit of the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins from bovine brain. It is concluded that all the sperm tested, with the possible exception of sea urchin sperm, contain a G(i)-like protein.

Fleming A.E.,Digestive efficiency of the Australian abalone Haliotis rubra in relation to growth and feed preference,1995,Aquaculture,134,3-Apr,279,293,,"The digestibilities of dry and organic matter, energy and nitrogen were determined for Haliotis rubra feeding on a range of monospecific algal diets. These digestibilities, in conjunction with total intakes, were used to estimate the daily intakes of nitrogen and energy of abalone feeding on those algal species used by Fleming (1995). These were then used to explain the growth rates, intakes and chemosensory preferences of abalone in that study. The chemosensory preferences of abalone were strongly related to the digestible nitrogen content of the algae and to a slightly lesser extent the nitrogen content of the algae, indicating the important role nitrogen plays in setting preferences in this abalone. The intakes of digestible nitrogen were significantly related to the growth rates of abalone, suggesting that nitrogen is a limiting nutrient to abalone growth. Thus, H. rubra selects those foods which maximise the intake of nitrogen and result in maximum growth rates. Energy does not appear to play a major role in setting abalone preference as the digestible energy contents of algae in this study (and in general) are similar and did not correlate with preference. The digestible nitrogen content was lowest in the 3 brown algae tested and digestibility was related to the polyphenolic content of the brown algae. This suggests that the low growth of H. rubra on these species results from the action of polyphenolic compounds, reducing nitrogen digestibility. © 1995.",10.1016/0044-8486(95)00055-7,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028814447

In this paper, the protein requirements of abalone, Haliotis discus. REEVE, were investigated by feeding the diets whose protein source was white fish meal (Table 1). The results of feeding trials are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 1. The diets were provided ad libitum throughout the experiments. The daily growth rates of abalone fed diets having protein levels from 20 to 30 percent were nearly constant in each experimental series and their values fell at the protein levels lower than 15 percent. The daily growth rates of abalone, however, increased considerably at the protein levels higher than 30 percent of the diet. From the present and previous results (Fig. 1) it was concluded that abalone required protein levels of about 20 percent in the artificial diet for the normal growth when the diet was provided ad libitum. The increases of the daily growth rate at higher protein levels may be attributable to the presence of unidentified growth factor(s) for abalone in the white fish meal, since there was no difference in amount of diet consumed among different groups. © 1964, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analyses of the growth of these flat pearl composites reveal that biomineralization is initiated by the deposition of an organic sheet on the implanted substrate, followed by the growth of a calcite layer with preferred {10.4} orientation and, finally, by the growth of nacreous aragonite. The calcite layer is structurally similar to the green organic/calcite heterolayer of native shell nacre. It comprises 0.2-2.0-μm-diameter elongated crystallites of typical geological habits in various aggregate arrangements. The shell also contains an external layer of (00.1)-oriented prismatic calcite, which is deposited on one edge of a flat pearl and has a morphology similar to that of the {10.4}-oriented calcite layer. The transition from {10.4}-oriented calcite to aragonite in both the shell and the flat pearl is abrupt. In vitro calcium carbonate growth experiments reveal that a similar calcite-to-aragonite transition is induced by the addition of soluble proteins isolated from the aragonitic nacre. The growth of flat pearls is highly sensitive to physical and chemical properties of the abiotic substrate. Either roughened or hydrophobic substrates result in abnormal arrangements of the basal calcite layer, which are corrected for by a reinitiation of the biomineralization process, beginning with the deposition of an organic sheet. Insertion of flat pearls as substrates, however, results in continued nacre growth without the deposition of an organic sheet and a calcite layer.",10.1021/cm9503285,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2842584744
Fleming A.E.,"Growth, intake, feed conversion efficiency and chemosensory preference of the Australian abalone, Haliotis rubra",1995,Aquaculture,132,3-Apr,297,311,,"Feeding trials were conducted on Haliotis rubra using single-species algal diets. Trials were done over 150-350 days and change in weight was measured at regular intervals. The 6 diets of single species tested were the red algae Jeannerettia lobata and Laurencia botryoides, the green alga Ulva australis, and the brown algae Macrocystis angustifolia,Phyllospora comosa and Ecklonia radiata. The greatest growth rate and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) for a single algal diet was with J. lobata (51.0 mg · day -1, 4.0% wet weight). The highest intake was of P. comosa (4.1% body weight), but this did not result in a high growth rate (0.8 mg · day-1). Neither intake nor FCE were correlated with growth rate, suggesting that these measures are not good indicators of the nutritional value of a food item. The hierarchy of food preference of H. rubra was determined for the 6 test diets of single species based on chemosensory attractiveness, involving direct tactile and gustatory sampling. Abalone exhibited distinct preferences, the most preferred being J. lobata and the least preferred the phenolic-rich E. radiata. The hierarchy of chemosensory preference for the algae tested was related to the growth rate of abalone when feeding on these algae. Thus, preference appears to be under selective pressure to ensure that abalone select foods that are nutritionally valuable, resulting in optimum growth rates. However, the low-phenolic brown algae, M. angustifolia and P. comosa, were less preferred than L. botryoides, despite the negative growth and mortality of animals feeding on this alga. © 1995.",10.1016/0044-8486(94)00347-Q,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028993581

Addition of 18:2ω6 and 18: 3ω3 or ω3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (ω3 HUFA, a mixture of 20:5ω3 and 22:6ω3) to the diet improved weight gain and FCE. However, the effect of supplementation of 18:2ω6 or 18:3ω3 on growth and FCE was inferior to that of 20:4ω6 or ω3 HUFA. Feeding 18:2ω6 and 18:3ω3 resulted in elevation of 22:4ω6 and 22:5ω3 in the visceral polar lipids, respectively. However, such an elevation was not apparent in 22:5ω6 and 22:6ω3, suggesting a low ability of abalone to convert 22:4ω6 to 22:5ω6 and 22:5ω3 to 22:6ω3, respectively.

Red-algae such as Paehymenia sp., Rhodoglossum pul-cherum, Carpopeltis affinis etc. and brown-algae, Sargassum fulvellum are inferior in value as food for H. discus hannai. Melobesiae has also been found effective in the shell formation of the adult shellfish, 3) Diatom such as Melosira borealis or Navicula sp. has been found to be a suitable food even to adult abalones and they grow sufficiently well with this food alone. 4) When 2 species of algae are simultaneously given to abalones, they prefer Uiva pertusa to C. affinis, and Undaria pinnatifida to Ulva pertusa, showing some likes and dislikes. Generally speaking, when a mixed food is given to abalones, their growth are inferior to the growth of abalone, fed with algae which are superior as food. 5) It has been assumed that the optimum temperature for the growth of H. discus hannai is within the range of 15~20°C. 6) The efficiency of food conversion at the water temperature of 10 °C has been found to be 5~8% (12-21% in calorie equivalence) for abalones of 20~30g in weight fed with Undaria pinnatifida and 9~11% (24~29 cal. %) for ones of 60~90g in weight, and the case fed with Paehymenia sp. shows 8~13% (7 –11 cal. %) and 22~31% (20~28 cal. %) respectively, and in either case large sized abalones have shown higher rates, but the rates secured the stability at least between 50~100g in body weight. 7) For maintaining the body weight of abalones, necessary daily rates of feeding with U. pinnatifida are 1.75% (0.42% in calorie equivalence) and 0.65% (0.15 cal. %) respectively, for the ones of 20~30g and the ones of 60~90g in weight, and in the case fed with Pachy-menia sp. 0.82% (0.53 cal. %) and 0.08% (0.05 cal. %) respectively. These rates are smaller for the larger sized abalones. 8) The relation between the species of food and the maturation of gonad of abalones is in exact conformity with the relation between the species of food and the growth rate of abalones, and the food suitable for the growth of the shell also brings a good result to the maturation of gonad. 9) No significant difference in the chemical composition of the meat of abalones due to. © 1962, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

Hyperplastic epithelial cells had a rounded nucleus containing variable amounts of heterochromatin, dilated organelles, deposits of glycogen‐like particles, cyoplasmic vesicles and vacuoles. Oedematous epithelial cells were less altered. Degenerating chloride cells were present in both oedematous and proliferated epithelia. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell.

Douros W.J.,Stacking behavior of an intertidal abalone: an adaptive response or a consequence of space limitation?,1987,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,108,1,1,14,,"Intertidal populations of black abalone Haliotis cracherodii Leach at Santa Cruz Island, California, vary in density among surge channels from < 1 to 126 abalone/m2. Dense populations are characterized by high levels of intraspecific secondary substratum use (""stacking"") for attachment surfaces, though it is rare in low density areas. Use of shell surfaces by black abalone appears not to be an evolved adaptive strategy. Individuals in stacks fed significantly more than expected, yet solitary abalone next to stacks shared food trapped by stacks. In the laboratory, starvation did not increase the propensity of an abalone to stack. Stacks were equally common in the breeding and non-breeding seasons, suggesting that stacking behavior was not a mechanism to enhance reproductive success. Stacking did not enhance avoidance of predators or competitors. Laboratory experiments showed that stacking is density dependent and probably the result of limitation of primary attachment space. Removals of significant predators (sea otters and Chumash Indians) of adult abalone during the past two centuries probably led to increased densities of black abalone, which in turn has had an indirect effect on the prevalence of stacking. © 1987.",10.1016/0022-0981(87)90127-4,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249034605
SHEPHERD S.A.,Movement of the Southern Australian abalone Haliotis laevigata in relation to crevice abundance,1986,Australian Journal of Ecology,11,3,295,302,,"The long‐term movement of the abalone Haliotis laevigata was measured at three sites in Waterloo Bay, South Australia, characterized by differing amounts of available crevice space. Movement was negligible at a site where crevices were abundant, but extensive at a site without crevice space. At a site of limited available crevice space, the amount of movement increased as available crevice space decreased. In addition, the extent of movement was size dependent and movement was oriented in the direction of the approaching swell. Current experimental designs for measuring natural mortality of abalone depend heavily on assumptions about their movement. An understanding of this behaviour is thus a prerequisite for designing experiments to measure the mortality rates of abalone or other sedentary animals. The natural mortality rate at one site was estimated to be 0.59 (s.e.m. = 0.02, i.e. survival = 56% per year) and the disappearance rate (natural mortality and emigration) was independent of sex.

Near La Jolla, California (USA), where the concentration of lead in seawater is probably less than 0.08 μg l-1, most of the naturally occurring Egregia laevigata contains less than 0.4 μg Pb g-1 wet weight. The total body masses, without shells, of juvenile Haliotis rufescens fed on this seaweed for 3 to 6 months showed similar concentrations. When, however, E. laevigata is placed for 1 to 6 days in seawater to which lead has been added (0.1 or 1.0 mg l-1) both the seaweed and the abalone subsequently fed with it accumulate proportionally larger amounts of lead. After 6 months, young abalone fed on E. laevigata pretreated with 1.0 mg Pb l-1 accumulated up to 21 μg Pb g-1 wet weight. This amount of lead had no apparent consequences on the growth or activity of the molluscs. Analyses of 6 different organs from adult abalone showed that the lead was selectively concentrated in the digestive gland. In the foot (muscle tissue), which is the part normally consumed by humans, only negligible amounts were found. © 1976 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/BF00388424,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0017081704

The composition of the diets used in the present studies is shown in Table 1. A white fish meal was used as a protein source of artificial diets. The method of pre-paration of artificial diets fed was as follows: suitable quantities of water were added to the powdered diet containing sodium alginate, the pasty material thus obtained was coated on glass plate and then it was dipped in aqueous solution of CaCl2. By this treatment of diet, sodium alginate was converted to insoluble calcium alginate-gel in which various nutrients were kept. The results of feeding trials are shown in Fig. 1 and Tables 2 and 3. The larvae of abalone could utilize artificial diet containing no seaweeds and showed a good response of growth. The growth of abalone, however, was influenced more or less by the content of protein in the diets.

Druehl L.D.; Breen P.A.,Some Ecological Effects of Harvesting Macrocystis integrifolia,1986,Botanica Marina,29,2,97,104,,"This field study, conducted for 17 months in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada, examined the effect of harvesting the kelp Macrocystis integrifolia Bory on some conspicuous elements of understory biota. M. integrifolia was completely removed from one plot, partially removed from one plot, and left undisturbed in a control plot. At the end of the study period, the relative abundance of the brown alga Desmarestia ligulata and the green alga Ulva sp. had increased in the harvested plots relative to the control plot. Harvesting, and the resulting changes in understory plant composition, were reflected in the relative abundances of drifting plant fragments available to herbivores. In harvested areas, brown algal fragments other than M. integrifolia (mostly D. ligulata) dominated during the winter; whereas in the unharvested site M. integrifolia dominated the fragment pool throughout the year. None of the herbivores studied (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus, S. droebachiensis, Parastichopus californicus, and Haliotis kamtschatkana) decreased their density in response to harvesting. Gonadal indices of the two sea urchins were lower in the harvested areas, which indicated that these grazers were less well fed. We conclude that removal of M. integrifolia altered the abundance of both understory plants and drifting fragments. These alterations change the forage base for associated herbivores to one which may be less nutritious than in unharvested situations. © 1986, Walter de Gruyter.",10.1515/botm.1986.29.2.97,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-6844244564

However, no differences were found between diets containing heated and unheated fish silage at 30% protein inclusion, suggesting that the degree of hydrolysis did not affect protein utilization by abalone. Similar results were obtained when abalone viscera silage was used (50 μm day-1), producing faster growth rates than kelp (18 μm day-1) or kelp meal (12 μm day-1). In the same experiment a significant increase in growth rate was observed when abalone with low growth rates, resulting from feeding on kelp and kelp meal, were switched to a diet containing abalone viscera silage.

Kimura S.,Toxicity caused by some poisonous substances derived from foodstuffs and its modification under nutrition conditions,1984,Yakugaku Zasshi,104,5,423,439,,"1) Pheophorbide a, which is one of the decomposition products from chlorophyll, is widely distributed in foodstuffs, e.g. in salted vegetables and abalone viscera. This compound is known to cause photosensitivity in humans and animals. We have studied the mechanism of this phenomenon and shown that in the presence of pheophorbide a, visible light irradiation leads to the production of singlet oxygen. This, in turn, results in cell damage by oxidation of lipids, especially in the cell membranes. Further, we discovered that some kinds of vitamins display a preventive action against the photosensitivity caused by pheophorbide a. 2) It is well known that iodine dificiency causes edemic goiter in human subjects. On the other hand, many goitrogenic substances were found in various vegetables. We have studied the goitrogenic activity of soybean, and found that goitrogenic factors are some glucosides, saponin and isoflavonoids such as genistin and daidzin. In the process of this study, hyperplastic goiters were observed frequently in rats when they were given soybean under conditions of iodine deficiency for as long as 6 to 12 months. However, enlargement of the thyroid and malignancy were completely inhibited when a small amount of iodine was added to the diet. The study was undertaken to determine the involvement of intestinal bacteria in the induction of goitrogens from soybean glucosides using germ-free mice. It was found that germ-free mice were more sensitive to iodine deficiency than conventional mice, and it was suggested that iodine metabolism was modified significantly with intestinal flora.",10.1248/yakushi1947.104.5_423,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021426988
Kopf G.S.; Lewis C.A.; Vacquier V.D.,Characterization of basal and methylxanthine-stimulated Ca2+ transport in abalone spermatozoa,1984,Journal of Biological Chemistry,259,9,5514,5520,,"Methylxanthines, such as 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (MIX) and theophylline, stimulate abalone sperm 45Ca2+ uptake in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. MIX is the most potent compound tested, and the ability of these compounds to alter 45Ca2+ uptake resides with methyl or isobutyl substitution of the xanthine nucleus at multiple sites. Methylxanthine-stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake does not occur as a secondary consequence of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibition, and added cyclic nucleotides are also without effect. The dramatic elevation of intracellular cAMP concentrations and induction of the acrosome reaction of sperm incubated with methylxanthines in the presence of Ca2+ is mediated by a primary effect of methylxanthines on Ca2+ transport. Basal 45Ca2+ uptake occurs through a verapamil-insensitive site that obeys the properties of a simple diffusion-mediated process. MIX-stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake occurs through a carrier-mediated transport site that has low affinity for Ca2+ (K(m) = 19.9 mM) and is verapamil sensitive. 45Ca2+ uptake through both basal and MIX-stimulated sites is enhanced by low extracellular Na+ concentrations (≤ mM) and is not affected by either extracellular Mg2+ or K+. 45Ca2+ uptake through both sites is pH sensitive, but this sensitivity is different for each site. These data suggest that methylxanthines can affect sperm function via primary effects on Ca2+ transport, which occur through a specific carrier-mediated site(s). It is possible that many of the previously described effects of methylxanthines on sperm function are mediated via such changes in Ca2+ conductance.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021342593

Santelices B.; Doty M.S.,A review of Gracilaria farming,1989,Aquaculture,78,2,95,133,,"Close to 5000 tonnes (t) of agar are processed annually from 25 000 to 30 000 t of Gracilaria, harvested mainly from the wild in Chile, Argentina, Brazil and South Africa and from fishpond culture in Taiwan, Hainan Island, China, and mainland China. Steady increases in market demand together with lack of crop management have led to overharvesting the natural stocks, to shortages of Gracilaria, to higher prices for the crop and, along with the increased market, to a demand for reliable crop quantity and quality. The outcome has been great interest in Gracilaria farming, and a diversity of farming methods has been developed. In open waters, basically three approaches are used for planting Gracilaria crops: on the bottom, on nets or lines, and on floating rafts. With each approach, either vegetative material or spores can be planted. Alternatively, Gracilaria can be farmed in ponds, raceways or tanks. A comparative review of these methods indicates that bottom planting and line farming techniques, either from spores or from vegetative material, may provide the crops for agar and agarose production. The species so cultured yield relatively large amounts of good quality seaweed by labor-intensive means at low cost in the less-developed countries. The future of fishpond cultivation of Gracilaria is difficult to predict. Perhaps the seaweed will continue to be cultivated as feed for more economically-important organisms, such as sea urchins and abalone. Production in tanks or mixed systems of pond cultivation, with or without air pumping or CO2 addition, probably will be restricted to supplying Gracilaria as a luxury-priced fresh vegetable. A variety of production ecology studies has been important in the development of the various farming methods, and increased requirements for farmed Gracilaria in the near future are likely to stimulate new approaches. Additional field population studies are required to increase the efficiency of wild crop management and bottom planting. Research on nutrient metabolism is crucial for tank cultivation. Understanding the environmental effects on gel production is needed to control the quality and quantity of gel produced under the various farming techniques. Farming involving the outplanting of sporelings will require further knowledge of Gracilaria spore biology, while biomass demands will probably stimulate new efforts in strain selection and Gracilaria farming methods. © 1989.",10.1016/0044-8486(89)90026-4,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024944301
Winter F.C.; Estes J.A.,Experimental evidence for the effects of polyphenolic compounds from Dictyoneurum californicum Ruprecht (Phaeophyta: Laminariales) on feeding rate and growth in the red abalone Haliotus rufescens Swainson,1992,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,155,2,263,277,,"The effects of polyphenolic compounds from brown algae on grazing and growth rate of the California red abalone Haliotis rufescens Swainson were examined. Abalone consumed three phenolic-poor algal species, Laminaria sinclarii (Harvey) Farlow, Macrocystis pyrifera Agardh, and Nereocystis luetkeana Postels et Ruprecht (mean phenolic content = 0.52% dry mass), at a greater rate than two phenolic-rich species, Dictyoneurum californicum Ruprecht and Cystoseira osmundacea Agardh (mean phenolic content = 4.60% dry mass). This inverse relationship between phenolic content and consumption rate also existed after the algae were macerated and the liquid portion of the blended slurry incorporated in agar discs. However, the correlation between grazing rate and phenolic content imprpve d in this latter experiment, thus suggesting that abalone grazing was deterred significantly by the morphology of L. sinclarii and, to a lesser extent, of M. pyrifera. Polyphenolics extracted from D. californicum reduced abalone grazing rates by 90% when incorporated into agar discs at a concentration of 6 mg·ml-1. Although abalone were unable to maintain body mass when fed ad libitum on macerated M. pyrifera incorporated into agar discs, polyphenolics from D. californicum further inhibited shell growth when added to the discs at 5 mg·ml-1. The abalone ate less of the phenol-containing discs than of the discs lacking phenolics. Our results support findings of several prior studies that polyphenolic compounds from brown algae deter grazing by coastal zone herbivores in the northeast Pacific Ocean. © 1992.",10.1016/0022-0981(92)90067-K,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026496727
Uki N.; Kemuyama A.; Watanabe T.,Nutritional Evaluation of Several Protein Sources in Diets for Abalone Haliotis discus hannai,1985,NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI,51,11,1835,1839,,"An experiment was conducted to evaluate nutritional quality of several protein sources in diet for juvenile abalone Haliotis discus hannai ino by feeding them diets containing each of protein sources at a 30% level for 40 days. Growth rate expressed as a relative value to that obtained in the group receiving a diet containing casein as a protein source and PER of each protein source were measured as follows, casein: 100, 4.2; soybean meal: 63, 2.6; leaf protein concentrate prepared from rye grass: 53, 1.9; egg albumin: 47, 1.6; whole egg: 44, 1.6; white fishmeal: 35, 1.7 and corn gluten meal: 23, 1.2, respectively. These values were the highest in the abalone fed with the casein diet, suggesting a high nutritional quality of casein as a protein source in diet for abalone. While the dietary value of egg albumin, whole egg and white fishmeal were far inferior to casein, being quite different from the case of fish. The difference in protein quality is postulated to be mainly due to difference of digestibility of each protein source in the juvenile abalone. Improvement of digestibility of white fishmeal will be required for development of practical abalone feeds. © 1985, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

Morse D.E.,Biochemical and genetic engineering for improved production of abalones and other valuable molluscs,1984,Aquaculture,39,1-Apr,263,282,,"Intensification of production, modernization of technique, and improvement of cultivars are needed to increase the economic efficiency of molluscan cultivation industries in the United States and certain other countries. To help achieve such improvements, modern methods of biochemical and genetic engineering can be adapted to control biological processes which intrinsically limit the efficiency and yield of molluscan production. Critical life-cycle stages of several species of abalones and other commercially valuable molluscs which thus far have proved amenable to improved control by these means include reproduction, larval settlement, metamorphosis, and acceleration of early growth. Analysis of the physiological and molecular mechanisms that control reproduction in molluscs reveals a prostaglandin-dependent regulation of spawning in abalones and certain other species. Spawning of gravid adults can be induced by the addition of prostaglandins to the surrounding seawater, or, more reliably and inexpensively, by activation of the endogenous enzymatic synthesis of prostaglandin-related spawning triggers in response to added hydrogen peroxide. Peroxide activation of the prostaglandin-dependent spawning reaction has been found widely useful for obtaining synchronous and copious release of fully competent gametes in a large number of species of abalones, oysters, scallops, mussels, clams, and other valuable molluses; a number of these species had not been successfully spawned by other methods. Settlement and metamorphosis of many species can be brought under similar biochemical control. The efficient induction of settlement and metamorphosis of the larvae of many Haliotis (abalone) species normally requires contact with any of several crustose red algae usually associated with natural recruiting substrates. This requirement can be met by providing competent larvae with the essential algae or with specific proteins purified from these algae, although production of these inducers is both time consuming and costly. Most conveniently and inexpensively, this natural requirement can be met by providing the larvae with certain unique amino acid constituents normally associated with the inducing proteins. Thus, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) can be used simply, safely, and inexpensively to induce complete and rapid larval settlement and metamorphosis - with minimal mortality - in many commercially important abalone species. This and similar neurotransmitter-related, amino acid-derived compounds are proving comparably effective for the reliable induction of settlement and metamorphosis in a number of other valuable molluscan species. Recent analyses of the requirements for rapid early juvenile growth in abalones reveals a mechanism of growth control which is susceptible to exogenous hormonal acceleration. Present experiments aimed at genetic cloning and amplification of recombinant-DNA templates for the essential growth-regulating hormones, progress in the establishment of useful molluscan gene banks, and potential uses of this technology for molluscan aquaculture are described. © 1984.",10.1016/0044-8486(84)90271-0,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001489541
